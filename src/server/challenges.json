The army of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces were before him, 4 and he showed them the wealth of his glorious kingdom and the grandeur and the splendor of his magnificence for many days, 180 days. 5 And when these days were completed, the king held a banquet for seven days for all the people present in Shushan the citadel, from the greatest to the least, in the courtyard of the garden of the king's palace. 6 There were linen, fine cotton, and blue material held fast in ropes of fine fabric, purple wool in silver rings, pillars of marble, and couches of gold and silver on a pavement of porphyry, marble, pearl, and black marble.\n7 Wine was served in gold cups; each cup was different from the other, and the royal wine was plentiful, according to the means of the king. 8 The drinking was according to the rule that no one was under compulsion, for the king had arranged with the officials of his palace that each should do as he pleased.\n9 Queen Vashti also held a banquet for the women at the royal house of King Ahasuerus.\n10 On the seventh day, when the king's heart was in a cheerful mood because of the wine, he told Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas, the seven court officials who were personal attendants to King Ahasuerus, 11 to bring before the king Queen Vashti, wearing the royal headdress, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty, for she was very beautiful. 12 But Queen Vashti kept refusing to come at the king's order that was conveyed through the court officials. At this the king became very angry, and his rage flared up within him.\n13 The king then spoke to the wise men who had insight with regard to precedents (for in this way the king's matter came before all those versed in law and legal cases, 14 and those closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king and who occupied the highest positions in the kingdom). 15 The king asked: \"According to law, what is to be done with Queen Vashti because she has not obeyed the order of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the court officials?\"\n16 To this Memucan said in the presence of the king and the princes: \"It is not against the king alone that Queen Vashti has done wrong, but against all the princes and against all the peoples in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 17 For what the queen did will become known by all the wives, and they will despise their husbands and say, 'King Ahasuerus said to bring in Queen Vashti before him, but she refused to come.' 18 This very day the princesses of Persia and Media who know about what the queen did will talk to all the princes of the king, resulting in much contempt and indignation. 19 If it seems good to the king, let a royal decree be issued from him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti may never again come in before King Ahasuerus; and let the king confer her royal position on a woman who is better than she is. 20 And when the decree of the king is heard in all his vast realm, all the wives will give honor to their husbands, from the greatest to the least.\"\n21 This proposal pleased the king and the princes, and the king did what Memucan said. 22 So he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, for every husband to be master in his own house and to speak in the language of his own people.\nChapter 2\n1 After these things, when the rage of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decided against her. 2 Then the king's personal attendants said: \"A search should be made for young, beautiful virgins for the king. 3 And let the king appoint commissioners in all the provinces of his realm to bring together all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, to the house of the women. Let them be put in the care of Hegai the king's eunuch and guardian of the women, and let them be given beauty treatments. 4 And the young woman who is most pleasing to the king will be queen instead of Vashti.\" The suggestion was pleasing to the king, and that is what he did.\n5 There was a certain Jewish man in Shushan the citadel whose name was Mordecai son of Jair son of Shimei son of Kish, a Benjaminite, 6 who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the people who were deported with King Jeconiah of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took into exile. 7 He was the guardian of Hadassah, that is, Esther, the daughter of his father's brother, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was beautifully formed and attractive in appearance, and at the death of her father and her mother, Mordecai took her as his daughter. 8 When the king's word and his law were proclaimed and when many young women were brought together at Shushan the citadel under the care of Hegai, Esther was also taken to the king's house under the care of Hegai the guardian of the women.\n9 Now the young woman was pleasing to him and won his favor, so he promptly arranged for her beauty treatments and her diet, and he assigned to her seven selected young women from the king's house. He also transferred her and her young attendants to the best place in the house of the women. 10 Esther did not say anything about her people or her relatives, for Mordecai had instructed her not to tell anyone. 11 Day after day Mordecai would walk in front of the courtyard of the house of the women to learn about Esther's welfare and about what was happening to her.\n12 Each young woman had her turn to go in to King Ahasuerus after completing the 12-month treatment that was prescribed for the women, for this was the way they had to fulfill their beauty treatment-six months with oil of myrrh and six months with balsam oil and various ointments for beauty treatment. 13 Then the young woman was ready to go in to the king, and whatever she asked for would be given her when she went from the house of the women to the king's house. 14 In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second house of the women, under the care of Shaashgaz the king's eunuch, the guardian of the concubines. She would not go to the king again unless the king had been especially pleased with her and she was requested by name.\n15 And when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai the king's eunuch, the guardian of the women, recommended. (All the while Esther was winning the favor of everyone who saw her.) 16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal house in the tenth month, that is, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 17 And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he put the royal headdress on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. 18 And the king held a great banquet for all his princes and his servants, the banquet of Esther. He then proclaimed an amnesty for the provinces, and he kept giving gifts according to the means of the king.\n19 Now when virgins were brought together a second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate. 20 Esther did not say anything about her relatives and her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her; Esther continued to do what Mordecai said, just as when she was under his care.\n21 In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two court officials of the king, doorkeepers, got angry and plotted to do away with King Ahasuerus. 22 But Mordecai learned about it, and he immediately told Queen Esther. Esther then spoke to the king in Mordecai's name. 23 So the matter was investigated and eventually confirmed, and both men were hanged on a stake; and this was all recorded in the book of the history of the times in the presence of the king.\nChapter 3\n1 After this King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite and exalted him by putting his throne above all the other princes who were with him. 2 And all the king's servants who were in the king's gate would bow low and prostrate themselves to Haman, for this is what the king had commanded respecting him. But Mordecai refused to bow low or prostrate himself. 3 So the king's servants who were in the king's gate said to Mordecai: \"Why are you ignoring the king's commandment?\" 4 Day after day they would ask him, but he would not listen to them. Then they told Haman to see whether Mordecai's conduct would be tolerated; for he had told them that he was a Jew.\n5 Now when Haman saw that Mordecai refused to bow low and prostrate himself to him, Haman became filled with rage. 6 But he despised the thought of doing away with Mordecai alone, for they had told him about Mordecai's people. So Haman began seeking to annihilate all the Jews who were in the entire realm of Ahasuerus, all of Mordecai's people.\n7 In the first month, that is, the month of Nisan, in the 12th year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the Lot) before Haman to determine the day and the month, and it fell on the 12th month, that is, Adar. 8 Haman then said to King Ahasuerus: \"There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your realm, whose laws are different from those of all other peoples; and they do not obey the king's laws, and it is not in the king's interests to let them be. 9 If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed. I will pay 10,000 silver talents to the officials to put into the royal treasury.\"\n10 At that the king removed his signet ring from his own hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who was the enemy of the Jews. 11 The king said to Haman: \"The silver and the people are given to you, to do with them as you see fit.\" 12 The king's secretaries were then called on the 13th day of the first month. They put in writing all of Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors who were over the provinces, and the princes of the different peoples, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring.\n13 The letters were sent by means of couriers to all the king's provinces, giving the order to annihilate, to kill, and to destroy all the Jews, young and old alike, children and women, on a single day, on the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Adar, and to seize their possessions. 14 A copy of the document was to be issued as a law in every province and proclaimed to all the peoples, so that they would be prepared for that day. 15 The couriers went out quickly by order of the king; the law was issued in Shushan the citadel. The king and Haman then sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was in confusion.\nChapter 4\n1 When Mordecai learned of everything that had been done, he ripped his garments apart and put on sackcloth and ashes. Then he went out into the middle of the city, crying out loudly and bitterly. 2 He went only as far as the king's gate, for no one was to enter the king's gate wearing sackcloth. 3 And in every province where the king's word and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, along with fasting and weeping and wailing. Many were lying down in sackcloth and ashes. 4 When Esther's female attendants and her eunuchs came in and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments for Mordecai to wear instead of his sackcloth, but he refused them. 5 At this Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to serve her, and she ordered him to find out from Mordecai what this meant and what was happening.\n6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the public square of the city in front of the king's gate. 7 Mordecai told him about everything that had happened to him and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasury for the Jews to be destroyed. 8 He also gave him a copy of the written decree that had been issued in Shushan for their annihilation. He was to show it to Esther and explain it to her and instruct her to go in to the king to beg for his favor and to plead directly with him in behalf of her people.\n9 Hathach came back and told Esther what Mordecai had said. 10 Esther replied to Hathach with instructions to tell Mordecai: 11 \"All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces are aware that if any man or woman goes into the king's inner courtyard without being summoned, there is only one law that applies: He is to be put to death; he may live only if the king holds out to him the golden scepter. And I have not been summoned to the king now for 30 days.\"\n12 When Mordecai was told what Esther had said, 13 he replied to Esther: \"Do not imagine that because you are in the king's household you are any more likely to escape than all the other Jews. 14 For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another source, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether it is for a time like this that you have attained to your royal status?\"\n15 Then Esther replied to Mordecai: 16 \"Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan and fast in my behalf. Do not eat or drink for three days, night and day. I along with my female attendants will also fast. I will go in to the king, which is against the law, and if I am to perish, I will perish.\" 17 So Mordecai went his way and did all that Esther had instructed him to do.\nChapter 5\n1 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the king's house, opposite the king's house, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance. 2 As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she gained his favor, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Esther then approached and touched the top of the scepter.\n3 The king asked her: \"What is the matter, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it will be granted you!\" 4 Esther replied: \"If it pleases the king, let the king along with Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.\" 5 So the king said to his men: \"Tell Haman to come quickly, as Esther requests.\" So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.\n6 During the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther: \"What is your petition? It will be granted you! And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it will be done!\" 7 Esther answered: \"My petition and my request is, 8 If I have found favor with the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to act on my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will hold for them tomorrow; and tomorrow I will do as the king says.\"\n9 On that day Haman went out joyful and with a cheerful heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate and noticed that he did not rise and tremble in his presence, Haman was filled with rage against Mordecai. 10 However, Haman restrained himself and went to his house. Then he sent for his friends and Zeresh his wife. 11 Haman boasted about his glorious wealth, his many sons, and how the king had promoted him and had exalted him over the princes and the servants of the king.\n12 Haman added: \"What is more, Queen Esther invited no one else but me to accompany the king to the banquet she prepared. I am also invited tomorrow to be with her and the king. 13 But all of this fails to satisfy me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the king's gate.\" 14 So Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him: \"Have a stake put up, 50 cubits high. And in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to enjoy yourself at the banquet.\" This suggestion seemed good to Haman, so he had the stake put up.\nChapter 6\n1 That night the king could not sleep. So he said to bring the book of the historical records of the times, and it was read to the king. 2 There it was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two court officials of the king, doorkeepers, who had plotted to do away with King Ahasuerus. 3 The king asked: \"What honor and recognition has been given to Mordecai for this?\" To this the king's personal attendants said: \"Nothing has been done for him.\"\n4 Later the king said: \"Who is in the courtyard?\" Now Haman had come into the outer courtyard of the king's house to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the stake that he had prepared for him. 5 The king's attendants said to him: \"It is Haman standing in the courtyard.\" So the king said: \"Have him come in.\"\n6 When Haman came in, the king said to him: \"What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?\" Haman said in his heart: \"Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?\" 7 So Haman said to the king: \"For the man whom the king wishes to honor, 8 let them bring royal attire that the king wears and a horse on which the king rides, with the royal headdress on its head. 9 Then let the attire and the horse be put into the charge of one of the king's noble princes, and they should clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor and have him ride on the horse in the public square of the city. They should call out before him: 'This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!'\" 10 At once the king said to Haman: \"Quick! Take the attire and the horse, and do what you just said for Mordecai the Jew who is sitting in the king's gate. Do not leave out anything that you have said.\"\n11 So Haman took the attire and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai and made him ride in the public square of the city and called out before him: \"This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!\" 12 Afterward Mordecai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning with his head covered. 13 When Haman related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him: \"If Mordecai, before whom you have started to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him; you will surely fall before him.\"\n14 While they were still speaking with him, the king's court officials arrived and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had made.\nChapter 7\n1 So the king and Haman came in to Queen Esther's banquet. 2 The king said to Esther again on the second day during the banquet of wine: \"What is your petition, Queen Esther? It will be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it will be done!\" 3 Queen Esther answered: \"If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be granted as my petition, and my people as my request. 4 For we have been sold, I and my people, to be annihilated, killed, and destroyed. If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent. But the distress is not proper, for it will be damaging to the king.\"\n5 King Ahasuerus then said to Queen Esther: \"Who is this, and where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?\" 6 Esther said: \"The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman.\"\nHaman became terrified because of the king and the queen. 7 The king rose up in a rage from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden, but Haman stood up to plead with Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king was determined to punish him. 8 The king returned from the palace garden to the house of the wine banquet and saw that Haman had thrown himself on the couch where Esther was. The king exclaimed: \"Is he also going to rape the queen in my own house?\" As soon as these words left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 9 Harbona, one of the king's court officials, now said: \"Haman also prepared a stake for Mordecai, whose report saved the king. It is standing at Haman's house, 50 cubits high.\" At that the king said: \"Hang him on it.\" 10 So they hanged Haman on the stake that he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king's rage subsided.\nChapter 8\n1 On that day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther; and Mordecai came in before the king, because Esther had revealed how he was related to her. 2 Then the king removed his signet ring that he had taken away from Haman and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther put Mordecai in charge of the house of Haman.\n3 Moreover, Esther spoke again to the king. She fell down at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to undo the harm done by Haman the Agagite and his scheme against the Jews. 4 The king held the golden scepter out to Esther, at which Esther rose and stood before the king. 5 She said: \"If it pleases the king and if I have his favor, and if it seems proper to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to annul the documents of that schemer Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces. 6 For how can I bear to look upon the disaster that will come upon my people, and how can I bear to see the destruction of my relatives?\"\n7 So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew: \"Look! I have given the house of Haman to Esther and have had him hanged on the stake, because of his plot to attack the Jews. 8 You may now write in the king's name whatever you see fit in behalf of the Jews and seal it with the king's signet ring, for a decree that is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be revoked.\"\n9 So the secretaries of the king were summoned at that time in the third month, that is, the month of Sivan, on the 23rd day, and they wrote all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, as well as to the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language and to the Jews in their own script and language.\n10 He wrote it in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring and sent the written documents by the hand of couriers on horses; they rode on swift post-horses, bred for royal service. 11 In these documents the king granted permission to the Jews in all the different cities to gather together and defend their lives and to annihilate, kill, and destroy any forces of any people or province that might attack them, including women and children, and to seize their possessions. 12 This was to occur on the same day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Adar. 13 The text of the document was to be issued as law throughout all the provinces. It was to be proclaimed to all the peoples, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies. 14 The couriers riding the post-horses used in the royal service went out urgently and speedily at the king's order. The law was also issued in Shushan the citadel.\n15 Now Mordecai left the king's presence in royal apparel of blue and white, wearing a great golden crown and a fine-fabric cloak of purple wool. And the city of Shushan shouted for joy. 16 For the Jews there was relief and rejoicing and exultation and honor. 17 And in all the provinces and all the cities, wherever the decree of the king and his law reached, the Jews were rejoicing and exulting, holding banquets and celebrations. Many of the peoples of the land were declaring themselves Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen upon them.\nChapter 9\n1 On the 13th day of the 12th month, that is, the month of Adar, when the king's word and his law were to be carried out, on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them, the opposite happened, and the Jews defeated those who hated them. 2 The Jews gathered together in their cities in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those seeking to harm them, and not a man could stand against them, for the dread of them had fallen upon all the peoples. 3 And all the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those handling the business of the king were supporting the Jews, for they were in fear of Mordecai. 4 Mordecai had become powerful in the king's house, and his fame was spreading throughout all the provinces, because Mordecai was steadily growing more powerful.\n5 The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them; they did whatever they wanted to those hating them. 6 In Shushan the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men. 7 Also, they killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 10 the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But after they killed them, they did not seize any plunder.\n11 On that day the number of those killed in Shushan the citadel was reported to the king.\n12 The king said to Queen Esther: \"In Shushan the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and the ten sons of Haman. What, then, have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? What is your petition now? It will be granted you. And what is your further request? It will be done.\" 13 Esther replied: \"If it pleases the king, let the Jews who are in Shushan be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today's law; and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the stake.\" 14 So the king gave orders for that to be done. A law was issued in Shushan, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.\n15 The Jews in Shushan gathered together again on the 14th day of the month of Adar and killed 300 men in Shushan, but they did not seize any plunder.\n16 The rest of the Jews in the provinces of the king also gathered together and defended their lives. They got rid of their enemies, killing 75,000 of those who hated them; but they did not seize any plunder. 17 That was on the 13th day of the month of Adar, and they rested on the 14th day and made it a day of feasting and of rejoicing.\n18 The Jews in Shushan gathered together on the 13th day and on the 14th day, and they rested on the 15th day and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing. 19 That is why the rural Jews inhabiting the cities of the outlying districts made the 14th day of the month of Adar a day of rejoicing and feasting, a day of celebration, and a time to send portions of food to one another.\n20 Mordecai recorded these events and sent official letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far. 21 He instructed them to observe the 14th day of the month of Adar, as well as the 15th day, each and every year, 22 because on those days the Jews rested from their enemies and in that month their grief was changed to rejoicing and their mourning to a day of celebration. They were to observe them as days of feasting and rejoicing and as a time to send portions of food to one another and gifts to the poor.\n23 And the Jews agreed to continue the celebration that they had started and to do what Mordecai wrote to them. 24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them, and he had cast Pur, that is, the Lot, to throw them into a panic and to destroy them. 25 But when Esther came in before the king, he gave orders in writing: \"Let his evil scheme against the Jews come back on his own head\"; and they hanged him and his sons on the stake. 26 That is why they called these days Purim, after the name of the Pur. Therefore, because of all that was written in this letter and what they saw concerning this matter and what had come upon them, 27 the Jews obligated themselves and their descendants and all those joining them to celebrate these two days without fail and to carry out what was written concerning them at the appointed time each and every year. 28 These days were to be remembered and observed in every generation, by each family, each province, and each city; and these days of Purim should not cease among the Jews, and their commemoration should not come to an end among their descendants.\n29 Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm a second letter about Purim. 30 He sent official letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces, the realm of Ahasuerus, in words of peace and truth 31 to confirm the observance of the days of Purim at their appointed times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had instructed them to do and just as they had obligated themselves and their descendants to carry out, including the fasting and supplication. 32 And the command of Esther confirmed these matters concerning Purim, and it was recorded in a book.\nChapter 10\n1 King Ahasuerus imposed forced labor on the land and the islands of the sea.\n2 And all his powerful and mighty accomplishments, as well as the detailed account of Mordecai's greatness to which the king exalted him, are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Media and Persia? 3 For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus. He was great among the Jews and respected by the multitude of his brothers, working for the good of his people and advocating the welfare of all their descendants. \n",

    "text": "Ecclesiastes\nChapter 1\n1 The words of the congregator, the son of David, the king in Jerusalem.\n2 \"The greatest futility!\" says the congregator,\n\"The greatest futility! Everything is futile!\"\n3 What does a person gain from all his hard work\nAt which he toils under the sun?\n4 A generation is going, and a generation is coming,\nBut the earth remains forever.\n5 The sun rises, and the sun sets;\nThen it hurries back to the place where it rises again.\n6 The wind goes south and circles around to the north;\nRound and round it continuously circles; the wind keeps making its rounds.\n7 All the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full.\nTo the place from which the streams flow, there they return so as to flow again.\n8 All things are wearisome;\nNo one can even speak of it.\nThe eye is not satisfied at seeing;\nNor is the ear filled from hearing.\n9 What has been is what will be,\nAnd what has been done will be done again;\nThere is nothing new under the sun.\n10 Is there anything of which one may say, \"Look at this-it is new\"?\nIt already existed from long ago;\nIt already existed before our time.\n11 No one remembers people of former times;\nNor will anyone remember those who come later;\nNor will they be remembered by those who come still later.\n12 I, the congregator, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 I set my heart to study and explore with wisdom everything that has been done under the heavens-the miserable occupation that God has given to the sons of men that keeps them occupied.\n14 I saw all the works that were done under the sun,\nAnd look! everything was futile, a chasing after the wind.\n15 What is crooked cannot be made straight,\nAnd what is lacking cannot possibly be counted.\n16 Then I said in my heart: \"Look! I have acquired great wisdom, more than anyone who was before me in Jerusalem, and my heart gained a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.\" 17 I applied my heart to knowing wisdom and to knowing madness and to knowing folly, and this too is a chasing after the wind.\n18 For an abundance of wisdom brings an abundance of frustration,\nSo that whoever increases knowledge increases pain.\nChapter 2\n1 Then I said in my heart: \"Come and let me try out pleasure and see what good comes.\" But look! that too was futility.\n2 I said about laughter, \"It is madness!\"\nAnd about pleasure, \"What use is it?\"\n3 I explored with my heart by indulging myself with wine, all the while maintaining my own wisdom; I even embraced foolishness to find out what was the best thing for humans to do during their few days of life under the heavens. 4 I undertook great works. I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself. 5 I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them all sorts of fruit trees. 6 I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees. 7 I acquired male and female servants, and I had servants born in my household. I also acquired much livestock-cattle and flocks-more than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem. 8 I accumulated silver and gold for myself, the treasures of kings and of provinces. I gathered male and female singers for myself, as well as what brings great pleasure to the sons of men-a woman, yes, many women. 9 So I grew great and surpassed anyone prior to me in Jerusalem. And my wisdom remained with me.\n10 I did not deny myself anything that I desired. I did not withhold from my heart any sort of pleasure, for my heart was joyful because of all my hard work, and this was my reward for all my hard work. 11 But when I reflected on all the works that my own hands had done and on all the hard work that I had toiled to accomplish, I saw that everything was futile, a chasing after the wind; there was nothing of real value under the sun.\n12 Then I turned my attention to wisdom and madness and folly. (For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.) 13 And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, just as there is an advantage to light over darkness.\n14 The wise one has his eyes in his head; but the stupid one is walking in darkness. I have also come to realize that there is one outcome that befalls all of them. 15 Then I said in my heart: \"What happens to the stupid one will also happen to me.\" What, then, did I gain by becoming excessively wise? So I said in my heart: \"This too is futility.\" 16 For there is no lasting memory either of the wise one or of the stupid one. In the days to come, everyone will be forgotten. And how will the wise one die? Along with the stupid one.\n17 So I came to hate life, because everything being done under the sun seemed distressing to me, for everything was futile, a chasing after the wind. 18 I came to hate all that I had worked so hard for under the sun, because I must leave it behind for the man coming after me. 19 And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will take control over all the things I spent great effort and wisdom to acquire under the sun. This too is futility. 20 So I began to despair in my heart over all the hard work at which I had toiled under the sun. 21 For a man may work hard, guided by wisdom and knowledge and skill, but he must hand over his portion to a man who did not work for it. This too is futility and a great tragedy.\n22 What does a man really gain from all his hard work and ambition that drives him to work hard under the sun? 23 For during all his days, his occupation brings pain and frustration, and even at night his heart does not rest. This too is futility.\n24 There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and find enjoyment in his hard work. This too, I have realized, is from the hand of the true God, 25 for who eats and who drinks better than I do?\n26 To the man who pleases him he gives wisdom and knowledge and rejoicing, but to the sinner he gives the occupation of gathering and merely collecting to give to the one who pleases the true God. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.\nChapter 3\n1 There is an appointed time for everything,\nA time for every activity under the heavens:\n2 A time for birth and a time to die;\nA time to plant and a time to uproot what was planted;\n3 A time to kill and a time to heal;\nA time to tear down and a time to build up;\n4 A time to weep and a time to laugh;\nA time to wail and a time to dance;\n5 A time to throw stones away and a time to gather stones together;\nA time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing;\n6 A time to search and a time to give up as lost;\nA time to keep and a time to throw away;\n7 A time to rip apart and a time to sew together;\nA time to be silent and a time to speak;\n8 A time to love and a time to hate;\nA time for war and a time for peace.\n9 What does the worker gain from all his efforts? 10 I have seen the occupation that God has given to the sons of men to keep them occupied. 11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has even put eternity in their heart; yet mankind will never find out the work that the true God has made from start to finish.\n12 I have concluded that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during their life, 13 also that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.\n14 I have come to know that everything the true God makes will endure forever. There is nothing to add to it and nothing to subtract from it. The true God has made it this way, so that people will fear him.\n15 Whatever happens has already happened, and what is to come has already been; but the true God seeks what has been pursued.\n16 I have also seen this under the sun: In the place of justice there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there was wickedness. 17 So I said in my heart: \"The true God will judge both the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every activity and every action.\"\n18 I also said in my heart about the sons of men that the true God will test them and show them that they are like animals, 19 for there is an outcome for humans and an outcome for animals; they all have the same outcome. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit. So man has no superiority over animals, for everything is futile. 20 All are going to the same place. They all come from the dust, and they all are returning to the dust. 21 Who really knows whether the spirit of humans ascends upward, and whether the spirit of animals descends down to the earth? 22 And I saw that there is nothing better than for a man to find enjoyment in his work, because that is his reward; for who can enable him to see what will happen after he is gone?\nChapter 4\n1 Again I turned my attention to all the acts of oppression that go on under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and there was no one to comfort them. And their oppressors had the power, and there was no one to comfort them. 2 And I congratulated the dead who had already died rather than the living who were still alive. 3 And better off than both of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the distressing deeds that are done under the sun.\n4 And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.\n5 The stupid one folds his hands while his flesh wastes away.\n6 Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.\n7 I turned my attention to another example of futility under the sun: 8 There is a man who is all alone, without any companion; he has no son or brother, but there is no end to all his hard work. His eyes are never satisfied with riches. But does he ask himself, 'For whom am I working hard and depriving myself of good things'? This too is futility and a miserable occupation.\n9 Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their hard work. 10 For if one of them falls, the other can help his partner up. But what will happen to the one who falls with no one to help him up?\n11 Moreover, if two lie down together, they will stay warm, but how can just one keep warm? 12 And someone may overpower one alone, but two together can take a stand against him. And a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn apart.\n13 Better is a poor but wise child than an old but stupid king, who no longer has enough sense to heed a warning. 14 For he went out from prison to become king, although in that one's kingship he was born poor. 15 I considered all those alive who walk about under the sun, as well as how it goes with the young successor who stands up in the other's place. 16 Although there is no end to all his supporters, those who come later will not be happy with him. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.\nChapter 5\n1 Watch your step whenever you go to the house of the true God; it is better to draw near to listen than to give a sacrifice as the stupid ones do, for they are not aware that what they are doing is bad.\n2 Do not be quick with your mouth, nor let your heart speak rashly before the true God, for the true God is in the heavens but you are on the earth. That is why your words should be few. 3 For a dream comes from too many preoccupations, and the chatter of the stupid one comes from too many words. 4 Whenever you make a vow to God, do not delay to pay it, for he finds no pleasure in the stupid ones. What you vow, pay. 5 Better for you not to vow than to vow and not pay. 6 Do not allow your mouth to cause you to sin, and do not say before the angel that it was a mistake. Why make the true God indignant over what you say so that he has to destroy the work of your hands? 7 For just as many preoccupations lead to dreams, so, too, many words lead to futility. But fear the true God.\n8 If you see any oppression of the poor and a violation of justice and righteousness in your district, do not be surprised about the matter. For that high official is being watched by one who is higher than he is, and there are others who are still higher than they are.\n9 Also, the profit of the land is divided among them all; even the king is served by the field.\n10 A lover of silver will never be satisfied with silver, nor a lover of wealth with income. This too is futility.\n11 When good things increase, those consuming them increase. And what advantage is it to the owner, except to look at them with his eyes?\n12 Sweet is the sleep of the one serving, whether he eats little or much, but the plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep.\n13 There is a great tragedy that I have seen under the sun: riches that were hoarded by their owner to his own harm. 14 Those riches were lost because of a disastrous venture, and when he becomes a father to a son, he has nothing left in his possession.\n15 Just as one came from his mother's womb, naked he will go away, just as he came. And he cannot carry away anything for all his hard work.\n16 This too is a great tragedy: Exactly as he came, so he will go away; and what profit is there to the one who keeps working hard for the wind? 17 Also, every day he eats in darkness, with a great deal of frustration and sickness and anger.\n18 This is what I have seen to be good and proper: that one should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all the hard work at which he toils under the sun during the few days of life that the true God has given him, for that is his reward. 19 Also, when the true God gives a man riches and material possessions along with the ability to enjoy them, he should take his reward and rejoice in his hard work. This is the gift of God. 20 For he will hardly notice the passing days of his life, because the true God keeps him preoccupied with the rejoicing of his heart.\nChapter 6\n1 There is another tragedy that I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 2 The true God gives a man riches and material possessions and glory, so that he lacks nothing that he desires; yet the true God does not enable him to enjoy them, although a stranger may enjoy them. This is futility and a severe affliction. 3 If a man should become a father a hundred times and live for many years and reach old age, yet he does not enjoy his good things before he reaches the grave, I must say that a stillborn child is better off than he is. 4 For this one came in vain and went away in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness. 5 Even though he never saw the sun or knew anything, he is still better off than the former one. 6 What is the benefit of living a thousand years twice over but not experiencing enjoyment? Do not all go to the same place?\n7 All the hard work of a man is to fill his mouth; yet his appetite is never satisfied. 8 For what advantage does the wise one have over the stupid one, or of what benefit is it that the poor man knows how to survive? 9 Better to enjoy what the eyes see than to wander after one's desires. This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.\n10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is; and he is not able to dispute with the one more powerful than he. 11 The more words, the more futility; and what advantage do they bring to man? 12 Who knows what is best for a man to do in life during the few days of his futile life, which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell man what will happen under the sun after he is gone?\nChapter 7\n1 A good name is better than good oil, and the day of death is better than the day of birth. 2 Better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting, for that is the end of every man, and the living should take it to heart. 3 Better is distress than laughter, for the sadness of the face makes the heart better. 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of the stupid is in the house of rejoicing.\n5 Better to listen to a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools. 6 For as the crackling of thorns burning under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool; and this too is futility. 7 But oppression can drive the wise one into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart.\n8 Better is the end of a matter than its beginning. Better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit. 9 Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.\n10 Do not say, \"Why were the former days better than these?\" for it is not out of wisdom that you ask this.\n11 Wisdom together with an inheritance is a good thing and an advantage to those who see the light of day. 12 For wisdom is a protection just as money is a protection, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.\n13 Consider the work of the true God, for who can straighten out what he has made crooked? 14 On a good day, reflect this goodness, but on the day of adversity, consider that God made the one as well as the other, so that men cannot be certain of anything that will happen to them in the future.\n15 During my futile life I have seen everything-from the righteous one who perishes in his righteousness to the wicked one who lives long despite his badness.\n16 Do not be overly righteous, nor show yourself excessively wise. Why should you bring ruin to yourself? 17 Do not be excessively wicked, nor be foolish. Why should you die before your time? 18 It is best to grasp one warning without letting go of the other; for the one who fears God will heed them both.\n19 Wisdom makes a wise man more powerful than ten strong men in a city. 20 For there is no righteous man on earth who always does good and never sins.\n21 Also, do not take to heart every word that people say; otherwise, you may hear your servant calling down evil on you; 22 for you well know in your heart that many times you yourself have called down evil on others.\n23 All of this I tested with wisdom, and I said: \"I will become wise.\" But it was beyond me. 24 What has come to be is out of reach and exceedingly deep. Who can understand it? 25 I directed my heart to know and to explore and to search for wisdom and the reason behind things, and to understand the wickedness of stupidity and the folly of madness. 26 Then I discovered this: More bitter than death is the woman who is like a hunter's net, whose heart is like dragnets, and whose hands are like prison chains. The one who pleases the true God will escape her, but the sinner is captured by her.\n27 \"See, this is what I found,\" says the congregator. \"I investigated one thing after another to reach my conclusion, 28 but what I continually sought, I have not found. One man out of a thousand I found, but a woman among them I have not found. 29 This alone I have found: The true God made mankind upright, but they have sought out many schemes.\"\nChapter 8\n1 Who is like the wise man? Who knows the solution to a problem? A man's wisdom lights up his face and softens his stern appearance.\n2 I say: \"Obey the king's orders out of regard for the oath to God. 3 Do not rush to depart from his presence. Do not take a stand for anything bad; for he can do whatever he pleases, 4 because the word of the king is absolute; who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'\"\n5 The one who observes the commandment will not experience harm, and the wise heart will know the right time and procedure. 6 For every matter there is a time and procedure, because the troubles of mankind are so abundant. 7 Since no one knows what will happen, who can tell him how it will happen?\n8 Just as no man has power over the spirit or can restrain the spirit, so no one has power over the day of death. Just as no one is discharged during a war, so wickedness will not allow those who practice it to escape.\n9 All of this I have seen, and I applied my heart to every work that has been done under the sun, during the time that man has dominated man to his harm. 10 And I saw the wicked being buried, those who used to go in and out of the holy place, but they were soon forgotten in the city where they acted that way. This too is futility.\n11 Because sentence against a bad deed has not been executed speedily, the heart of men becomes emboldened to do bad. 12 Although a sinner may do bad a hundred times and still live a long time, yet I am aware that it will turn out well for those who fear the true God, because they fear him. 13 But it will not turn out well for the wicked one, nor will he prolong his days that are like a shadow, because he does not fear God.\n14 There is something futile that takes place on the earth: There are righteous people who are treated as if they had acted wickedly, and there are wicked people who are treated as if they had acted righteously. I say that this too is futility.\n15 So I recommended rejoicing, because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and drink and rejoice; this should accompany him as he works hard during the days of his life, which the true God gives him under the sun.\n16 I applied my heart to acquire wisdom and to see all the activity happening on the earth, even going without sleep day and night. 17 Then I considered all the work of the true God, and I realized that mankind cannot comprehend what happens under the sun. No matter how hard men try, they cannot comprehend it. Even if they claim that they are wise enough to know, they cannot really comprehend it.\nChapter 9\n1 So I took all of this to heart and concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their works, are in the hands of the true God. Men are not aware of the love and the hate that took place prior to them. 2 All have the very same outcome, the righteous and the wicked, the good and the clean and the unclean, those sacrificing and those not sacrificing. The good one is the same as the sinner; the one who swears an oath is the same as the one who is cautious about swearing an oath. 3 This is a distressing thing that happens under the sun: Because all have the same outcome, the heart of humans is also full of bad; and there is madness in their heart during their life, and then they die!\n4 There is hope for whoever is among the living, because a live dog is better off than a dead lion. 5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten. 6 Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun.\n7 Go, eat your food with rejoicing, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for already the true God has found pleasure in your works. 8 May your clothing always be white, and do not fail to put oil on your head. 9 Enjoy life with your beloved wife all the days of your futile life, which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your futility, for that is your lot in life and in your hard work at which you toil under the sun. 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.\n11 I have seen something further under the sun, that the swift do not always win the race, nor do the mighty win the battle, nor do the wise always have the food, nor do the intelligent always have the riches, nor do those with knowledge always have success, because time and unexpected events overtake them all. 12 For man does not know his time. Just as fish are caught in an evil net and birds are caught in a trap, so the sons of men are ensnared in a time of disaster, when it suddenly overtakes them.\n13 I also observed this about wisdom under the sun-and it impressed me: 14 There was a small city with a few men in it; and a mighty king came against it and surrounded it and built great siegeworks against it. 15 In it was found a poor but wise man, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But no one remembered that poor man. 16 And I said to myself: 'Wisdom is better than mightiness; yet a poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heeded.'\n17 Better to heed the calm words of the wise than the shouts of the one ruling among fools.\n18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but just one sinner can destroy much good.\nChapter 10\n1 As dead flies cause the perfumer's oil to stink and bubble, so a little foolishness outweighs wisdom and glory.\n2 The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way. 3 In whatever way the fool walks, he is lacking good sense, and he lets everyone know that he is a fool.\n4 If the anger of a ruler should flare up against you, do not leave your place, for calmness allays great sins.\n5 There is something distressing that I have seen under the sun, the sort of mistake made by those in power: 6 Foolishness is put in many high positions, but the rich remain in low positions.\n7 I have seen servants on horseback but princes walking on foot just like servants.\n8 The one who digs a pit may fall into it; and the one who breaks through a stone wall may be bitten by a snake.\n9 The one who quarries stones may be hurt by them, and the one who splits logs may be endangered by them.\n10 If an iron tool is dull and one does not sharpen its edge, he will need to exert much effort. But wisdom helps to achieve success.\n11 If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the skilled charmer.\n12 The words from the mouth of the wise one bring favor, but the lips of the stupid one are his ruin. 13 The first words out of his mouth are foolishness, and his last words are disastrous madness. 14 But the fool keeps on speaking.\nA man does not know what will happen; who can tell him what will come after him?\n15 The hard work of the stupid one wears him out, for he does not even know how to find his way to the city.\n16 How terrible for a land when the king is a boy and the princes start their feasting in the morning! 17 How happy for the land when the king is the son of nobles and the princes eat at the proper time for strength, not for drunkenness!\n18 Because of extreme laziness the roof beams sag, and because of idle hands the house leaks.\n19 Bread is made for laughter, and wine makes life enjoyable; but money answers every need.\n20 Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king, and do not curse the rich in your bedroom; for a bird may convey the sound, or a creature with wings may repeat what was said.\nChapter 11\n1 Cast your bread on the waters, for after many days you will find it again. 2 Give a share to seven or even to eight, for you do not know what disaster will occur on the earth.\n3 If the clouds are filled with water, they will pour down rain on the earth; and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, the place where the tree falls is where it will lie.\n4 The one who watches the wind will not sow seed, and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.\n5 Just as you do not know how the spirit operates in the bones of the child inside a pregnant woman, so you do not know the work of the true God, who does all things.\n6 Sow your seed in the morning and do not let your hand rest until the evening; for you do not know which will have success, whether this one or that one, or whether they will both do well.\n7 Light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun. 8 For if a man should live many years, let him enjoy them all. But he should remember that the days of darkness may be many; all that is to come is futility.\n9 Rejoice, young man, while you are young, and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and go where your eyes lead you; but know that the true God will bring you into judgment for all these things. 10 So remove troublesome things from your heart, and ward off harmful things from your body, for youth and the prime of life are futility.\nChapter 12\n1 Remember, then, your Grand Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of distress come and the years arrive when you will say: \"I have no pleasure in them\"; 2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the downpour; 3 in the day when the guards of the house become shaky, and the strong men stoop over, and the women quit grinding because they have become few, and the ladies looking out the windows find it dark; 4 when the doors to the street have been closed, when the sound of the grinding mill becomes low, when one gets up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song grow faint. 5 Also, one is afraid of heights, and there are terrors in the street. And the almond tree blossoms, and the grasshopper drags itself along, and the caper berry bursts, because man is walking to his lasting house and the mourners walk about in the street; 6 before the silver cord is removed, and the golden bowl is crushed, and the jar at the spring is broken, and the waterwheel for the cistern is crushed. 7 Then the dust returns to the earth, just as it was, and the spirit returns to the true God who gave it.\n8 \"The greatest futility!\" says the congregator. \"Everything is futile.\"\n9 Not only had the congregator become wise but he continually taught the people what he knew, and he pondered and made a thorough search in order to compile many proverbs. 10 The congregator sought to find delightful words and to record accurate words of truth.\n11 The words of the wise are like oxgoads, and their collected sayings are like firmly embedded nails; they have been given from one shepherd. 12 As for anything besides these, my son, be warned: To the making of many books there is no end, and much devotion to them is wearisome to the flesh.\n13 The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man. 14 For the true God will judge every deed, including every hidden thing, as to whether it is good or bad. \n",

[Zayin]\n7 Jehovah has rejected his altar;\nHe has spurned his sanctuary.\nHe has surrendered the walls of her fortified towers into the hand of the enemy.\nThey have raised their voice in the house of Jehovah, as on the day of a festival.\n? [Heth]\n8 Jehovah has resolved to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.\nHe has stretched out the measuring line.\nHe has not held back his hand from bringing destruction.\nAnd he causes rampart and wall to mourn.\nTogether they have been made weak.\n? [Teth]\n9 Her gates have sunk down into the earth.\nHe has destroyed and broken her bars.\nHer king and her princes are among the nations.\nThere is no law; even her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.\n? [Yod]\n10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence.\nThey throw dust on their heads and wear sackcloth.\nThe virgins of Jerusalem have bowed their heads down to the ground.\n? [Kaph]\n11 My eyes are worn out from shedding tears.\nMy insides are churning.\nMy liver has been poured out on the ground, because of the downfall of the daughter of my people,\nBecause of the children and infants fainting away in the public squares of the town.\n? [Lamed]\n12 They keep asking their mothers, \"Where are grain and wine?\"\nAs they faint away like someone wounded in the public squares of the city,\nAs their life ebbs away in their mothers' arms.\n? [Mem]\n13 What can I use as a witness,\nOr to what can I liken you, O daughter of Jerusalem?\nTo what can I compare you, to comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion?\nFor your breakdown is as vast as the sea. Who can heal you?\n? [Nun]\n14 The visions your prophets saw for you were false and empty,\nAnd they did not expose your error in order to turn away your captivity,\nBut they kept visioning for you false and misleading pronouncements.\n? [Samekh]\n15 At you all those passing by on the road scornfully clap their hands.\nThey whistle in amazement and shake their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying:\n\"Is this the city about which they said, 'It is perfect in beauty, the joy of all the earth'?\"\n? [Pe]\n16 At you all your enemies have opened their mouth.\nThey whistle and grind their teeth and say: \"We have swallowed her down.\nThis is the day we were waiting for! It has arrived, and we have seen it!\"\n? [Ayin]\n17 Jehovah has done what he intended; he has carried out his saying,\nWhat he commanded long ago.\nHe has torn down without compassion.\nHe has let the enemy rejoice over you; he has exalted the strength of your adversaries.\n? [Tsade]\n18 Their heart cries out to Jehovah, O wall of the daughter of Zion.\nLet tears stream down like a torrent day and night.\nGive yourself no respite, give your eye no rest.\n? [Qoph]\n19 Rise up! Cry out during the night, at the start of the watches.\nPour out your heart like water before the face of Jehovah.\nRaise your hands to him for the lives of your children,\nWho are fainting away at every street corner because of famine.\n? [Resh]\n20 See, O Jehovah, and look upon the one with whom you have dealt so harshly.\nShould women keep eating their own offspring, their own fully formed children,\nOr should priests and prophets be killed in the sanctuary of Jehovah?\n? [Shin]\n21 Young boy and old man are lying dead on the ground in the streets.\nMy virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.\nYou have killed in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered without compassion.\n? [Taw]\n22 As if for a festival day, you summon terrors from every direction.\nIn the day of the wrath of Jehovah, no one escaped or survived;\nThose whom I gave birth to and reared, my enemy exterminated.\nChapter 3\n? [Aleph]\n1 I am the man who has seen affliction because of the rod of his fury.\n2 He has driven me out and makes me walk in darkness, not in light.\n3 Indeed, he repeatedly brings his hand against me all day long.\n? [Beth]\n4 He has worn away my flesh and my skin;\nHe has broken my bones.\n5 He has besieged me; he has surrounded me with bitter poison and hardship.\n6 He has forced me to sit in dark places, like men who died long ago.\n? [Gimel]\n7 He has walled me in, so that I cannot escape;\nHe has bound me with heavy copper fetters.\n8 And when I cry out desperately for help, he rejects my prayer.\n9 He has blocked up my paths with hewn stones;\nHe has made my roadways crooked.\n? [Daleth]\n10 He waits to ambush me like a bear, like a lion in hiding.\n11 He has forced me off the paths and torn me to pieces;\nHe has made me desolate.\n12 He has bent his bow, and he sets me up as the target for the arrow.\n? [He]\n13 He has pierced my kidneys with the arrows of his quiver.\n14 I have become a laughingstock to all the peoples, the theme of their song all day long.\n15 He has filled me with bitter things and saturated me with wormwood.\n? [Waw]\n16 He breaks my teeth with gravel;\nHe makes me cower in the ashes.\n17 You deprive me of peace; I have forgotten what is good.\n18 So I say: \"My splendor has perished, as well as my expectation in Jehovah.\"\n? [Zayin]\n19 Remember my affliction and my homeless state, the wormwood and the bitter poison.\n20 You will surely remember and bow low over me.\n21 I recall this in my heart; that is why I will show a waiting attitude.\n? [Heth]\n22 It is because of Jehovah's loyal love that we have not come to our finish,\nFor his mercies never end.\n23 They are new each morning; your faithfulness is abundant.\n24 \"Jehovah is my share,\" I have said, \"that is why I will show a waiting attitude for him.\"\n? [Teth]\n25 Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him, to the person who keeps seeking him.\n26 Good it is to wait in silence for the salvation of Jehovah.\n27 Good it is for a man to carry the yoke during his youth.\n? [Yod]\n28 Let him sit alone and keep silent when He lays it upon him.\n29 Let him put his mouth in the very dust; there may yet be hope.\n30 Let him give his cheek to the one striking him; let him have his fill of insults.\n? [Kaph]\n31 For Jehovah will not cast us off forever.\n32 Although he has caused grief, he will also show mercy according to his abundant loyal love.\n33 For it is not in his heart to afflict or grieve the sons of men.\n? [Lamed]\n34 To crush beneath one's feet all the prisoners of the earth,\n35 To deprive a man of justice in the presence of the Most High,\n36 To defraud a man in his legal case\n-Jehovah does not tolerate such things.\n? [Mem]\n37 Who, then, can speak and have it happen unless Jehovah commands it?\n38 From the mouth of the Most High,\nBad things and good things do not go out together.\n39 Why should a living person complain about the consequences of his sin?\n? [Nun]\n40 Let us examine and scrutinize our ways, and let us return to Jehovah.\n41 Let us lift up our hearts along with our hands to God in the heavens:\n42 \"We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven.\n? [Samekh]\n43 With anger you have blocked our approach;\nYou have pursued and killed us without compassion.\n44 You have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud, so that our prayer may not pass through.\n45 You make us offscouring and refuse among the peoples.\"\n? [Pe]\n46 All our enemies open their mouths against us.\n47 Dread and pitfalls have become our lot, desolation and breakdown.\n48 Streams of water flow from my eyes over the breakdown of the daughter of my people.\n? [Ayin]\n49 My eyes weep without ceasing, without pausing,\n50 Until Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven.\n51 My eyes have brought me grief because of all the daughters of my city.\n? [Tsade]\n52 Without cause my enemies have hunted me down like a bird.\n53 They have silenced my life in the pit; they kept hurling stones at me.\n54 Waters flowed over my head, and I said: \"I am finished!\"\n? [Qoph]\n55 I called out your name, O Jehovah, from the depths of the pit.\n56 Hear my voice; do not shut your ear to my cry for help, for relief.\n57 You drew near in the day that I called you. You said: \"Do not be afraid.\"\n? [Resh]\n58 You have defended my cause, O Jehovah, you have redeemed my life.\n59 You have seen, O Jehovah, the wrong done to me; please grant me justice.\n60 You have seen all their vengeance, all their schemes against me.\n? [Sin] or [Shin]\n61 You have heard their taunts, O Jehovah, all their schemes against me,\n62 The lips of my opposers and their whispering against me all day long.\n63 Look at them; whether they sit or stand, they mock me in their songs!\n? [Taw]\n64 You will repay them, O Jehovah, according to their deeds.\n65 You will make them hardhearted, as your curse to them.\n66 You will pursue them in your anger and annihilate them from under the heavens of Jehovah.\nChapter 4\n? [Aleph]\n1 How the shining gold has grown dim, the fine gold!\nHow the holy stones lie scattered at every street corner!\n? [Beth]\n2 As for the precious sons of Zion, who were weighed against refined gold,\nHow they have been regarded as earthenware jars,\nThe work of a potter's hands!\n? [Gimel]\n3 Even jackals offer the udder to nurse their young,\nBut the daughter of my people has become cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.\n? [Daleth]\n4 The tongue of the nursing infant sticks to its palate because of thirst.\nChildren beg for bread, but no one gives them any.\n? [He]\n5 Those who used to eat delicacies lie famished in the streets.\nThose who were brought up wearing scarlet have embraced ash heaps.\n? [Waw]\n6 The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment for the sin of Sodom,\nWhich was overthrown in a moment, with no hand to help her.\n? [Zayin]\n7 Her Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk.\nThey were more ruddy than corals; they were like polished sapphires.\n? [Heth]\n8 Their appearance has become darker than soot;\nThey are not recognized in the streets.\nTheir skin has shriveled over their bones; it has become like dry wood.\n? [Teth]\n9 Those slain with the sword are better off than those slain by famine,\nThose who waste away, who are pierced through for lack of food from the field.\n? [Yod]\n10 The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children.\nThey have become their food of mourning during the breakdown of the daughter of my people.\n? [Kaph]\n11 Jehovah has expressed his wrath;\nHe has poured out his burning anger.\nAnd he starts a fire in Zion that consumes her foundations.\n? [Lamed]\n12 The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the productive land did not believe\nThat the adversary and the enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem.\n? [Mem]\n13 It was because of the sins of her prophets, the errors of her priests,\nWho shed the blood of righteous ones in her midst.\n? [Nun]\n14 They have wandered blindly in the streets.\nThey are polluted with blood,\nSo that none are able to touch their garments.\n? [Samekh]\n15 \"Go away! Unclean!\" they call out to them. \"Go away! Go away! Do not touch us!\"\nFor they have gone homeless and wander about.\nPeople have said among the nations: \"They cannot stay here with us.\n? [Pe]\n16 The face of Jehovah has scattered them;\nHe will no longer look favorably on them.\nMen will show no respect for the priests, no favor to the elders.\"\n? [Ayin]\n17 Even now our eyes are worn out from looking in vain for help.\nWe looked and looked for help from a nation that could not save us.\n? [Tsade]\n18 They have hunted us down at every step so that we could not walk in our public squares.\nOur end has drawn near; our days have finished, for our end has come.\n? [Qoph]\n19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.\nThey chased us on the mountains; they ambushed us in the wilderness.\n? [Resh]\n20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Jehovah, has been captured in their large pit,\nThe one of whom we said: \"In his shade we will live among the nations.\"\n? [Sin]\n21 Exult and rejoice, O daughter of Edom, living as you do in the land of Uz.\nBut to you also the cup will be passed, and you will become drunk and expose your nakedness.\n? [Taw]\n22 The punishment for your error, O daughter of Zion, has come to its finish.\nHe will not carry you off into exile again.\nBut he will turn his attention to your error, O daughter of Edom.\nHe will uncover your sins.\nChapter 5\n1 Remember, O Jehovah, what has befallen us.\nLook and see our disgrace.\n2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners.\n3 We have become orphans without a father; our mothers are like widows.\n4 We must pay to drink our own water, and our own wood comes at a price.\n5 Those pursuing us are at our neck;\nWe are weary, but we are given no rest.\n6 We hold out our hand to Egypt and to Assyria, to get enough bread to eat.\n7 Our forefathers who sinned are no more, but we must bear their errors.\n8 Servants now rule over us; there is no one to snatch us from their hand.\n9 We bring in our bread at the risk of our life, because of the sword of the wilderness.\n10 Our skin has become as hot as a furnace, because of the pangs of hunger.\n11 The wives in Zion they have humiliated, the virgins in the cities of Judah.\n12 Princes were hanged by their hand, and elders were shown no respect.\n13 Young men carry the hand mill, and boys stumble under loads of wood.\n14 The elders are gone from the city gate; young men do not play their music.\n15 The joy is gone from our heart; our dancing has turned into mourning.\n16 The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, because we have sinned!\n17 Because of this our heart is sick,\nAnd because of these things our eyes have grown dim,\n18 Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes now roam on it.\n19 As for you, O Jehovah, you sit enthroned forever.\nYour throne is for generation after generation.\n20 Why do you forget us forever and abandon us for so long a time?\n21 Bring us back to yourself, O Jehovah, and we will readily return to you.\nRenew our days as in those of old.\n22 However, you have utterly rejected us.\nYou remain intensely angry with us. \n",

    "text": "Jonah\nChapter 1\n1 The word of Jehovah came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying: 2 \"Get up, go to Nineveh the great city, and proclaim judgment against her, for their wickedness has come to my attention.\"\n3 But Jonah got up to run away from Jehovah to Tarshish; he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish, away from Jehovah.\n4 Then Jehovah hurled a strong wind at the sea, and there was such a violent storm on the sea that the ship was about to be wrecked. 5 The mariners were so frightened that each of them began to call on his god for help. And they began throwing the articles of the ship into the sea, to make it lighter. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship, where he lay down and fell fast asleep. 6 The ship captain approached and said to him: \"Why are you sleeping? Get up, call out to your god! Perhaps the true God will show his concern for us, and we will not perish.\"\n7 Then they said to one another: \"Come, let us cast lots to find out who is to blame for this calamity.\" So they cast lots, and the lot fell to Jonah. 8 They said to him: \"Please tell us, who is to blame for this calamity that has come upon us? What is your work, and where do you come from? What is your country, and from what people are you?\"\n9 He replied: \"I am a Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah the God of the heavens, the One who made the sea and the dry land.\"\n10 At this the men became even more afraid, and they asked him: \"What have you done?\" (The men learned that he was running away from Jehovah, because he had told them.) 11 So they said to him: \"What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?\" For the sea was growing more and more stormy. 12 He replied: \"Lift me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will calm down for you; for I know that it is because of me that this violent storm has come upon you.\" 13 However, the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to dry land, but they could not, because the sea grew more and more stormy around them.\n14 Then they called out to Jehovah and said: \"Ah, now, O Jehovah, please, may we not perish because of this man! Do not hold us responsible for innocent blood, since you have done as you pleased, O Jehovah.\" 15 Then they lifted Jonah up and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging. 16 Then the men were struck with great fear of Jehovah, and they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah and made vows.\n17 Jehovah now sent a huge fish to swallow Jonah, so that Jonah came to be in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights.\nChapter 2\n1 Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish, 2 and he said:\n\"Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he answered me.\nOut of the depths of the Grave I cried for help.\nYou heard my voice.\n3 When you threw me to the depths, into the heart of the open sea,\nThen the currents engulfed me.\nAll your breakers and waves swept over me.\n4 And I said, 'I have been driven away from your sight!\nHow will I gaze again upon your holy temple?'\n5 Waters engulfed me and threatened my life;\nThe watery deep closed in on me.\nWeeds were wrapped around my head.\n6 To the bottoms of the mountains I sank down.\nThe bars of the earth were closing upon me forever.\nBut out of the pit you brought up my life, O Jehovah my God.\n7 When my life was ebbing away, Jehovah was the One whom I remembered.\nThen my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.\n8 Those who are devoted to the worthless idols forsake their source of loyal love.\n9 But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you.\nWhat I have vowed, I will pay.\nSalvation is from Jehovah.\"\n10 In time Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto the dry land.\nChapter 3\n1 Then the word of Jehovah came to Jonah a second time, saying: 2 \"Get up, go to Nineveh the great city, and proclaim to her the message that I tell you.\"\n3 So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh in obedience to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was a very large city-a walking distance of three days. 4 Then Jonah entered the city, and walking a day's journey, he was proclaiming: \"In just 40 days more, Nineveh will be overthrown.\"\n5 And the men of Nineveh put faith in God, and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. 6 When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he rose up from his throne and took off his royal garment and covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the ashes. 7 Furthermore, he issued a proclamation throughout Nineveh,\n\"By the decree of the king and his nobles: No man or beast, herd or flock, should eat anything at all. They should not take food, nor should they drink any water. 8 Let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast; and let them call out earnestly to God and turn from their evil ways and from the violence they practice. 9 Who knows whether the true God may reconsider what he intends to do and turn from his burning anger, so that we may not perish?\"\n10 When the true God saw what they did, how they had turned back from their evil ways, he reconsidered the calamity that he said he would bring on them, and he did not bring it.\nChapter 4\n1 But this was highly displeasing to Jonah, and he became hot with anger. 2 So he prayed to Jehovah: \"Ah, now, Jehovah, was this not my concern when I was in my own land? That is why I tried to flee to Tarshish in the first place; for I knew that you are a compassionate and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love, one who feels grieved over calamity. 3 Now, O Jehovah, please take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.\"\n4 Jehovah asked: \"Is it right for you to be so angry?\"\n5 Jonah then went out of the city and sat down east of the city. He made a shelter for himself there and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. 6 Jehovah God then provided a bottle-gourd plant to grow up over Jonah, to give him shade for his head and to relieve his misery. And Jonah was very pleased with the bottle-gourd plant.\n7 But the true God sent a worm at the break of dawn on the next day, and it attacked the bottle-gourd plant, and it withered. 8 When the sun began to shine, God also sent a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head, and he grew faint. He kept asking to die, and he kept saying, \"It is better for me to die than to live.\"\n9 God asked Jonah: \"Is it right for you to be so angry over the bottle-gourd plant?\"\nAt that he said: \"I have a right to be angry, so angry that I want to die.\" 10 But Jehovah said: \"You felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant, which you did not work for, nor did you make it grow; it grew in one night and perished in one night. 11 Should I not also feel sorry for Nineveh the great city, in which there are more than 120,000 men who do not even know right from wrong, as well as their many animals?\" \n",

Jehovah is going out from his place;\nHe will come down and tread on earth's high places.\n4 The mountains will melt under him,\nAnd the valleys will split apart\nLike wax before the fire,\nLike waters poured down a steep slope.\n5 All of this is because of the revolt of Jacob,\nBecause of the sins of the house of Israel.\nWhat is the revolt of Jacob?\nIs it not Samaria?\nAnd what are the high places of Judah?\nAre they not Jerusalem?\n6 I will make Samaria a heap of ruins of the field,\nA place for planting vineyards;\nI will hurl her stones down into the valley,\nAnd I will lay bare her foundations.\n7 All her graven images will be crushed to pieces,\nAnd all the gifts for which she hired herself out will be burned in the fire.\nI will devastate all her idols.\nFor she collected them from the wages of prostitution,\nAnd they will again become the wages of prostitutes.\"\n8 Because of this I will wail and howl;\nI will walk barefoot and naked.\nMy wailing will be like that of jackals,\nAnd my mourning like that of ostriches.\n9 For her wound cannot be healed;\nIt has come as far as Judah.\nThe plague has spread to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.\n10 \"Do not announce it in Gath;\nYou must not weep at all.\nIn Beth-aphrah roll in the dust.\n11 Cross over in nakedness and shame, O inhabitants of Shaphir.\nThe inhabitants of Zaanan have not come out.\nThere will be wailing in Beth-ezel, and it will take its support away from you.\n12 For the inhabitants of Maroth have waited for good,\nBut what is bad has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.\n13 Harness the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitants of Lachish.\nYou were the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion,\nFor in you were found the revolts of Israel.\n14 So you will give parting

from which you will not escape.\nYou will no longer walk haughtily, for it is a time of calamity.\n4 In that day people will recite a proverb concerning you,\nAnd they will bitterly lament over you.\nThey will say: \"We are completely devastated!\nHe caused the portion of my people to change hands-how he removes it from me!\nTo the unfaithful one he assigns our fields.\"\n5 So you will have no one to stretch the measuring cord,\nTo allot the land in the congregation of Jehovah.\n6 \"Stop preaching!\" they preach,\n\"They should not preach these things;\nHumiliation will not overtake

head.\"\nChapter 3\n1 I said: \"Hear, please, you heads of Jacob\nAnd you commanders of the house of Israel.\nShould you not know what is just?\n2 But you hate what is good and love what is bad;\nYou tear off the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones.\n3 You also eat the flesh of my people\nAnd strip off their skin,\nSmashing their bones, crushing them to pieces,\nLike what is cooked in a pot, like meat in a cooking pot.\n4 At that time they will call to Jehovah for help,\nBut he will not answer them.\nHe will hide his face from them at that time,\nBecause of their wicked deeds.\n5 This is what Jehovah says against the prophets who are leading my people astray,\nWho proclaim 'Peace!' while they bite with their teeth\nBut who declare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths:\n6 'You will have night; there will be no vision;\nThere will only be darkness for you, no divination.\nThe sun will set on the prophets,\nAnd the day will turn dark for them.\n7

power by the spirit of Jehovah,\nAnd with justice and might,\nTo tell to Jacob his revolt and to Israel his sin.\n9 Hear this, please, you heads of the house of Jacob\nAnd you commanders of the house of Israel,\nWho detest justice and who make crooked all that is straight,\n10 Who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with unrighteousness.\n11 Her leaders judge for a bribe,\nHer priests instruct for a price,\nAnd her prophets practice divination for money.\nAnd yet they lean on Jehovah, saying:\n\"Is not Jehovah with us?\nNo calamity will come upon us.\"\n12 So because of you,\nZion will be plowed up as a field,\nJerusalem will become heaps of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the House will become like high places in a forest.\nChapter 4\n1 In the final part of the days,\nThe mountain of the house of Jehovah\nWill become firmly established above the top of the mountains,\nAnd it will be raised up above the hills,\nAnd to it peoples will stream.\n2 And many nations will go and say:\n\"Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah\nAnd to the house of the God of Jacob.\nHe will instruct us about his ways,\nAnd we will walk in his paths.\"\nFor law will go out of Zion,\nAnd the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.\n3 He will render judgment among many peoples\nAnd set matters straight respecting mighty nations far away.\nThey will beat their swords into plowshares\nAnd their spears into pruning shears.\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,\nNor will they learn war anymore.\n4 They will sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree,\nAnd no one will make them afraid,\nFor the mouth of Jehovah of armies has spoken.\n5 For all the peoples will walk, each in the name of its god,\nBut we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.\n6 \"In that day,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"I will gather the one who was limping,\nAnd collect together the dispersed one,\nAlong with those I treated harshly.\n7 I will make the one who was limping a remnant,\nAnd the one far removed a mighty nation;\nAnd Jehovah will rule as king over them in Mount Zion,\nFrom now on and forever.\n8 As for you, O tower of the flock,\nThe mound of the daughter of Zion,\nTo you it will come, yes, the first dominion will come,\nThe kingdom belonging to the daughter of Jerusalem.\n9 Now why are you shouting loudly?\nHave you no king,\nOr has your adviser perished,\nSo that pain has seized you like a woman giving birth?\n10 Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,\nLike a woman giving birth,\nFor now you will go from the city and reside in the field.\nYou will go as far as to Babylon,\nAnd there you will be rescued;\nThere Jehovah will buy you back from the hand of your enemies.\n11 Now many nations will be gathered against you;\nThey will say, 'Let her be defiled,\nAnd let our eyes see this happen to Zion.'\n12 But they do not know the thoughts of Jehovah,\nThey do not understand his purpose;\nFor he will gather them like a row of newly cut grain to the threshing floor.\n13 Get up and thresh, O daughter of Zion;\nFor I will change your horns into iron,\nAnd I will change your hooves into copper,\nAnd you will pulverize many peoples.\nYou will devote their dishonest profit to Jehovah,\nAnd their resources to the true Lord of the whole earth.\"\nChapter 5\n1 \"Now you are slashing yourself,\nO daughter under attack;\nA siege is laid against us.\nWith a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek.\n2 And you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,\nThe one too little to be among the thousands of Judah,\nFrom you will come out for me the one to be ruler in Israel,\nWhose origin is from ancient times, from the days of long ago.\n3 So he will give them up\nUntil the time that she who is to give birth has given birth.\nAnd the rest of his brothers will return to the people of Israel.\n4 He will stand up and shepherd in the strength of Jehovah,\nIn the superiority of the name of Jehovah his God.\nAnd they will dwell in security,\nFor now his greatness will reach the ends of the earth.\n5 And he will bring peace.\nShould the Assyrian invade our land and tread on our fortified towers,\nWe will raise up against him seven shepherds, yes, eight princes of mankind.\n6 They will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,\nAnd the land of Nimrod at its entrances.\nAnd he will rescue us from the Assyrian,\nWhen he invades our land and treads on our territory.\n7 The remaining ones of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples\nLike dew from Jehovah,\nLike showers of rain on vegetation\nThat do not put hope in man\nOr wait for the sons of men.\n8 The remaining ones of Jacob will be among the nations,\nIn the midst of many peoples,\nLike a lion among the beasts of a forest,\nLike a young lion among flocks of sheep,\nThat passes through and pounces and tears in pieces;\nAnd there is no one to rescue them.\n9 Your hand will be raised over your adversaries,\nAnd all your enemies will be destroyed.\"\n10 \"In that day,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"I will do away with your horses from your midst and destroy your chariots.\n11 I will destroy the cities of your land\nAnd tear down all your fortified places.\n12 I will put an end to the sorcery you practice,\nAnd no one practicing magic will remain among you.\n13 I will destroy your graven images and your pillars from your midst,\nAnd you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands.\n14 I will uproot your sacred poles from your midst\nAnd annihilate your cities.\n15 In anger and wrath I will execute vengeance\nOn the nations that have not obeyed.\"\nChapter 6\n1 Hear, please, what Jehovah is saying.\nGet up, present a legal case before the mountains,\nAnd may the hills hear your voice.\n2 Hear, O mountains, the legal case of Jehovah,\nYou firm foundations of the earth,\nFor Jehovah has a legal case with his people;\nIt is against Israel that he will argue:\n3 \"My people, what have I done to you?\nHow have I tired you out?\nTestify against me.\n4 For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,\nFrom the house of slavery I redeemed you;\nI sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.\n5 My people, remember, please, what King Balak of Moab proposed,\nAnd what Balaam the son of Beor answered him\n-What took place from Shittim to Gilgal-\nSo that you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.\"\n6 With what will I come before Jehovah?\nWith what will I bow before God on high?\nWill I come before him with whole burnt offerings,\nWith year-old calves?\n7 Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams,\nWith tens of thousands of torrents of oil?\nWill I give my firstborn son for my revolt,\nThe fruit of my body for my sin?\n8 He has told you, O man, what is good.\nAnd what is Jehovah requiring of you?\nOnly to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty,\nAnd to walk in modesty with your God!\n9 The voice of Jehovah calls out to the city;\nThose with practical wisdom will fear your name.\nPay attention to the rod and to the one who appointed it.\n10 Are there still the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked\nAnd the incomplete ephah measure that is detestable?\n11 Can I be morally clean with wicked scales,\nWith a bag of fraudulent stone weights?\n12 For her rich men are full of violence,\nAnd her inhabitants speak lies;\nTheir tongue is deceitful in their mouth.\n13 \"Therefore, I will wound you by striking you,\nMaking you desolate because of your sins.\n14 You will eat but not be satisfied;\nYou will be empty inside.\nWhat you remove, you will not carry off safely,\nAnd what you do carry off, I will give to the sword.\n15 You will sow seed, but you will not reap.\nYou will tread olives, but you will not use the oil;\nAnd you will make new wine, but you will drink no wine.\n16 For you observe the statutes of Omri and all the work of the house of Ahab,\nAnd you walk in accord with their advice.\nThat is why I will make you an object of horror\nAnd her inhabitants something to be whistled at;\nAnd you will bear the scorn of the peoples.\"\nChapter 7\n1 Woe to me! I am like one who,\nAfter the gathering of summer fruit\nAnd the gleaning following a grape harvest,\nFinds no cluster of grapes to eat,\nNo early fig that I crave.\n2 The loyal one has perished from the earth;\nAmong men there is no one upright.\nAll of them lie in ambush for bloodshed.\nEach hunts his own brother with a dragnet.\n3 Their hands are expert at doing what is bad;\nThe prince is making demands,\nThe judge asks for a reward,\nThe prominent one makes known his desires,\nAnd they work it out together.\n4 Their best one is like thorns,\nTheir most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge.\nThe day of your watchmen and of your reckoning will come.\nNow they will panic.\n5 Do not put faith in your companion\nOr trust a close friend.\nGuard what you say to the one who lies in your embrace.\n6 For a son despises his father,\nA daughter rises up against her mother,\nAnd a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law;\nA man's enemies are the men of his household.\n7 But as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.\nI will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation.\nMy God will hear me.\n8 Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy.\nAlthough I have fallen, I will rise up;\nAlthough I dwell in the darkness, Jehovah will be my light.\n9 The wrath of Jehovah I will bear\n-For I have sinned against him-\nUntil he pleads my legal case and brings about justice for me.\nHe will bring me out to the light;\nI will look upon his righteousness.\n10 My enemy will also see,\nAnd shame will cover her who said to me:\n\"Where is Jehovah your God?\"\nMy eyes will look upon her.\nNow she will be trampled like mud in the streets.\n11 It will be a day for building your stone walls;\nOn that day the boundary will be extended.\n12 On that day they will come to you\nAll the way from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,\nFrom Egypt all the way to the River;\nFrom sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.\n13 And the land will become desolate because of its inhabitants,\nAs a result of what they have done.\n14 Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance,\nThe one who was living alone in a forest-in the midst of an orchard.\nLet them feed on Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.\n15 \"As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,\nI will show him wonderful things.\n16 Nations will see and be ashamed despite all their might.\nThey will put their hand over their mouth;\nTheir ears will become deaf.\n17 They will lick the dust like serpents;\nLike the reptiles of the earth they will come trembling out of their strongholds.\nTo Jehovah our God they will come in dread,\nAnd they will be in fear of you.\"\n18 Who is a God like you,\nPardoning error and passing over the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?\nHe will not hold onto his anger forever,\nFor he delights in loyal love.\n19 He will again show us mercy; he will conquer our errors.\nYou will throw all their sins into the depths of the sea.\n20 You will show faithfulness to Jacob,\nLoyal love to Abraham,\nAs you swore to our forefathers from the days of old. \n",

You eat, but it is not to satisfaction. You drink, but you do not drink your fill. You put on clothing, but no one gets warm. The one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full of holes.'\"\n7 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Set your heart on your ways.'\n8 \"'Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber. And build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and I may be glorified,' Jehovah says.\"\n9 \"'You were expecting much and receiving little; and when you brought it into the house, I blew it away. For what reason?' declares Jehovah of armies. 'Because my house is in ruins, while each of you runs around taking care of his own house. 10 So the heavens above you withheld their dew, and the earth withheld its produce. 11 And I kept calling for a drought on the earth, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what grows from the ground, on humans and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.'\"\n12 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the rest of the people listened to the voice of Jehovah their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, because Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people began to show fear because of Jehovah.\n13 Then Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, gave this message to the people in harmony with his commission from Jehovah: \"'I am with you people,' declares Jehovah.\"\n14 So Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people; and they came and began to work on the house of Jehovah of armies, their God. 15 This was on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius.\nChapter 2\n1 In the seventh month, on the 21st day of the month, the word of Jehovah came through Haggai the prophet, saying, 2 \"Please ask Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the rest of the people: 3 'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem like nothing in comparison?'\n4 \"'But now be strong, Zerubbabel,' declares Jehovah, 'and be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.'\n\"'And be strong, all you people of the land,' declares Jehovah, 'and work.'\n\"'For I am with you,' declares Jehovah of armies. 5 'Remember what I promised you when you came out of Egypt, and my spirit remains among you. Do not be afraid.'\"\n6 \"For this is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Yet once more-in a little while-and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.'\n7 \"'And I will shake all the nations, and the precious things of all the nations will come in; and I will fill this house with glory,' says Jehovah of armies.\n8 \"'The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' declares Jehovah of armies.\n9 \"'The future glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says Jehovah of armies.\n\"'And in this place I will grant peace,' declares Jehovah of armies.\"\n10 On the 24th day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Haggai the prophet, saying: 11 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Ask, please, the priests about the law: 12 \"If a man carries holy flesh in the fold of his clothing, and his clothing touches bread or stew or wine or oil or any sort of food, will it become holy?\"'\"\nThe priests answered: \"No!\"\n13 Haggai then asked: \"If someone who is unclean from contact with a dead body touches any of these things, will it become unclean?\"\nThe priests answered: \"It will become unclean.\"\n14 So Haggai said: \"'That is how this people is, and that is how this nation is before me,' declares Jehovah, 'and that is how all the work of their hands is; whatever they present there is unclean.'\n15 \"'But now, please, set your heart on this from this day forward: Before a stone was placed on a stone in the temple of Jehovah, 16 how was it then? When someone came to a heap of grain expecting 20 measures, there were only 10; and when someone came to the vat to draw 50 measures from the wine trough, there were only 20; 17 I struck you-all the works of your hands-with scorching blight and mildew and hail, but not one of you turned to me,' declares Jehovah.\n18 \"'Please, set your heart on this from this day forward, from the 24th day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was laid; set your heart on this: 19 Is there seed yet in the storehouse? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree-they have not yet borne fruit, have they? From this day I will send a blessing.'\"\n20 The word of Jehovah came a second time to Haggai on the 24th day of the month, saying: 21 \"Say to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, 'I am going to shake the heavens and the earth. 22 I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and annihilate the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariot and its riders, and the horses and their riders will fall, each one by the sword of his brother.'\"\n23 \"'In that day,' declares Jehovah of armies, 'I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares Jehovah, 'and I will make you like a seal ring, because you are the one whom I have chosen,' declares Jehovah of armies.\" \n",

    "text": "Second Peter\nChapter 1\n1 Simon Peter, a slave and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have acquired a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and the Savior Jesus Christ:\n2 May undeserved kindness and peace be increased to you by an accurate knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, 3 for his divine power has granted us all the things that contribute to life and godly devotion through the accurate knowledge of the One who called us by his own glory and virtue. 4 Through these things he has granted us the precious and very grand promises, so that through these you may become sharers in divine nature, having escaped from the world's corruption produced by wrong desire.\n5 For this very reason, put forth all earnest effort to supply to your faith virtue, to your virtue knowledge, 6 to your knowledge self-control, to your self-control endurance, to your endurance godly devotion, 7 to your godly devotion brotherly affection, to your brotherly affection love. 8 For if these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n9 For anyone lacking these things is blind, shutting his eyes to the light, and has become forgetful of his cleansing from his sins of long ago. 10 Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and choosing sure for yourselves, for if you keep on doing these things, you will by no means ever fail. 11 In fact, in this way you will be richly granted entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n12 For this reason I intend always to remind you of these things, although you know them and are well-established in the truth that is present in you. 13 But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you with reminders, 14 knowing as I do that my tabernacle is soon to be removed, just as also our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. 15 I will always do my utmost so that after my departure, you may be able to recall these things for yourselves.\n16 No, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but rather, we were eyewitnesses of his magnificence. 17 For he received from God the Father honor and glory when words such as these were conveyed to him by the magnificent glory: \"This is my Son, my beloved, whom I myself have approved.\" 18 Yes, these words we heard coming from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain.\n19 So we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place (until day dawns and a daystar rises) in your hearts. 20 For you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. 21 For prophecy was at no time brought by man's will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.\nChapter 2\n1 However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you. These will quietly bring in destructive sects, and they will even disown the owner who bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves. 2 Furthermore, many will follow their brazen conduct, and because of them the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively. 3 Also, they will greedily exploit you with counterfeit words. But their judgment, decided long ago, is not moving slowly, and their destruction is not sleeping.\n4 Certainly God did not refrain from punishing the angels who sinned, but threw them into Tartarus, putting them in chains of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment. 5 And he did not refrain from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a flood upon a world of ungodly people. 6 And by reducing the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly people of things to come. 7 And he rescued righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the brazen conduct of the lawless people- 8 for day after day that righteous man was tormenting his righteous soul over the lawless deeds that he saw and heard while dwelling among them. 9 So, then, Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people to be destroyed on the day of judgment, 10 especially those who seek to defile the flesh of others and who despise authority.\nDaring and self-willed, they are not afraid to speak abusively of glorious ones, 11 whereas angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them an accusation in abusive terms, out of respect for Jehovah. 12 But these men, like unreasoning animals that act on instinct and are born to be caught and destroyed, speak abusively about things of which they are ignorant. They will suffer destruction brought on by their own destructive course, 13 suffering harm as their reward for their own harmful course.\nThey consider it pleasurable to indulge in luxurious living, even in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes who revel in their deceptive teachings while feasting together with you. 14 Their eyes are full of adultery and are unable to desist from sin, and they entice unstable ones. They have a heart trained in greed. They are accursed children. 15 Abandoning the straight path, they have been led astray. They have followed the path of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the reward of wrongdoing, 16 but was reproved for his own violation of what was right. A voiceless beast of burden speaking with a human voice hindered the prophet's mad course.\n17 These are waterless springs and mists driven by a violent storm, and the blackest darkness has been reserved for them. 18 They make high-sounding statements that are empty. By appealing to the desires of the flesh and with acts of brazen conduct, they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error. 19 While they are promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for if anyone is overcome by someone, he is his slave. 20 Certainly if after escaping from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, their final state has become worse for them than the first. 21 It would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it to turn away from the holy commandment they had received. 22 What the true proverb says has happened to them: \"The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.\"\nChapter 3\n1 Beloved ones, this is now the second letter I am writing you in which, as in my first one, I am stirring up your clear thinking faculties by way of a reminder, 2 that you should remember the sayings previously spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles. 3 First of all know this, that in the last days ridiculers will come with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires 4 and saying: \"Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation's beginning.\"\n5 For they deliberately ignore this fact, that long ago there were heavens and an earth standing firmly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God; 6 and that by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was flooded with water. 7 But by the same word the heavens and the earth that now exist are reserved for fire and are being kept until the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly people.\n8 However, do not let this escape your notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. 9 Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. 10 But Jehovah's day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be exposed.\n11 Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, 12 as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which the heavens will be destroyed in flames and the elements will melt in the intense heat! 13 But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.\n14 Therefore, beloved ones, since you are awaiting these things, do your utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace. 15 Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you according to the wisdom given him, 16 speaking about these things as he does in all his letters. However, some things in them are hard to understand, and these things the ignorant and unstable are twisting, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.\n17 You, therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, be on your guard so that you may not be led astray with them by the error of the lawless people and fall from your own steadfastness. 18 No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen. \n",

And this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.\n5 This is the message that we heard from him and are announcing to you: God is light, and there is no darkness at all in him. 6 If we make the statement, \"We are having fellowship with him,\" and yet we go on walking in the darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth. 7 However, if we are walking in the light as he himself is in the light, we do have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.\n8 If we make the statement, \"We have no sin,\" we are misleading ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we make the statement, \"We have not sinned,\" we are making him a liar, and his word is not in us.\nChapter 2\n1 My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one. 2 And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world's. 3 And by this we realize that we have come to know him, namely, if we continue observing his commandments. 4 The one who says, \"I have come to know him,\" and yet does not observe his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person. 5 But whoever does observe his word, in this person the love of God has truly been made perfect. By this we know that we are in union with him. 6 The one who says he remains in union with him is himself under obligation to go on walking just as that one walked.\n7 Beloved ones, I am writing you, not a new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word that you heard. 8 Again, I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in his case and in yours, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.\n9 The one who says that he is in the light and yet hates his brother is still in the darkness. 10 The one who loves his brother remains in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and is walking in the darkness, and he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.\n12 I am writing you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for the sake of his name. 13 I am writing you, fathers, because you have come to know him who is from the beginning. I am writing you, young men, because you have conquered the wicked one. I write you, young children, because you have come to know the Father. 14 I write you, fathers, because you have come to know him who is from the beginning. I write you, young men, because you are strong and the word of God remains in you and you have conquered the wicked one.\n15 Do not love either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; 16 because everything in the world-the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one's means of life-does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. 17 Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.\n18 Young children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared, from which fact we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of our sort; for if they had been of our sort, they would have remained with us. But they went out so that it might be shown that not all are of our sort. 20 And you have an anointing from the holy one, and all of you have knowledge. 21 I write you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie originates with the truth.\n22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either. But whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in union with the Son and in union with the Father. 25 Furthermore, this is what he himself promised us-the life everlasting.\n26 I write you these things about those who are trying to mislead you. 27 And as for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie. Just as it has taught you, remain in union with him. 28 So now, little children, remain in union with him, so that when he is made manifest we may have freeness of speech and not shrink away from him in shame at his presence. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him.\nChapter 3\n1 See what sort of love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are. That is why the world does not know us, because it has not come to know him. 2 Beloved ones, we are now children of God, but it has not yet been made manifest what we will be. We do know that when he is made manifest we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is. 3 And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure.\n4 Everyone who practices sin is also practicing lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. 5 You know, too, that he was made manifest to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him. 6 Everyone remaining in union with him does not practice sin; no one who practices sin has either seen him or come to know him. 7 Little children, let no one mislead you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. 8 The one who practices sin originates with the Devil, because the Devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, to break up the works of the Devil.\n9 Everyone who has been born from God does not practice sin, for His seed remains in such one, and he cannot practice sin, for he has been born from God. 10 The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Whoever does not practice righteousness does not originate with God, nor does the one who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; 12 not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother. And for what reason did he slaughter him? Because his own works were wicked, but those of his brother were righteous.\n13 Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed over from death to life, because we love the brothers. The one who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him. 16 By this we have come to know love, because that one surrendered his life for us, and we are under obligation to surrender our lives for our brothers. 17 But whoever has the material possessions of this world and sees his brother in need and yet refuses to show him compassion, in what way does the love of God remain in him? 18 Little children, we should love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.\n19 By this we will know that we originate with the truth, and we will assure our hearts before him 20 regarding whatever our hearts may condemn us in, because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. 21 Beloved ones, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have freeness of speech toward God; 22 and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we are observing his commandments and doing what is pleasing in his eyes. 23 Indeed, this is his commandment: that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he gave us a commandment. 24 Moreover, the one who observes his commandments remains in union with him, and he in union with such one. And by the spirit that he gave us, we know that he remains in union with us.\nChapter 4\n1 Beloved ones, do not believe every inspired statement, but test the inspired statements to see whether they originate with God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.\n2 This is how you know that the inspired statement is from God: Every inspired statement that acknowledges Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh originates with God. 3 But every inspired statement that does not acknowledge Jesus does not originate with God. Furthermore, this is the antichrist's inspired statement that you have heard was coming, and now it is already in the world.\n4 You originate with God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the one who is in union with you is greater than the one who is in union with the world. 5 They originate with the world; that is why they speak what originates with the world and the world listens to them. 6 We originate with God. Whoever comes to know God listens to us; whoever does not originate with God does not listen to us. By this we distinguish the inspired statement of truth from the inspired statement of error.\n7 Beloved ones, let us continue loving one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love has not come to know God, because God is love. 9 By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. 10 The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.\n11 Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us, then we are also under obligation to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we continue loving one another, God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us. 13 By this we know that we are remaining in union with him and he in union with us, because he has given his spirit to us. 14 In addition, we ourselves have seen and are bearing witness that the Father has sent his Son as savior of the world. 15 Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is God's Son, God remains in union with such one and he in union with God. 16 And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us.\nGod is love, and the one who remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him. 17 In this way love has been made perfect in us, so that we may have freeness of speech in the day of judgment, because just as that one is, so are we ourselves in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts fear out, because fear restrains us. Indeed, the one who is fearful has not been made perfect in love. 19 We love, because he first loved us.\n20 If anyone says, \"I love God,\" and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 21 And we have this commandment from him, that whoever loves God must also love his brother.\nChapter 5\n1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God, and everyone who loves the one who caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and carry out his commandments. 3 For this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome, 4 because everyone who has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.\n5 Who can conquer the world? Is it not the one who has faith that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the one who came by means of water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the spirit is bearing witness, because the spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three witness bearers: 8 the spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.\n9 If we accept the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. Because this is the witness God gives, the witness that he has given about his Son. 10 The person putting his faith in the Son of God has the witness within himself. The person not having faith in God has made him a liar, because he has not put his faith in the witness given by God concerning his Son. 11 And this is the witness, that God gave us everlasting life, and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son has this life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have this life.\n13 I write you these things so that you may know that you have life everlasting, you who put your faith in the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that no matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us concerning whatever we are asking, we know that we are to have the things we ask for, since we have asked them of him.\n16 If anyone catches sight of his brother committing a sin that does not incur death, he will ask, and God will give life to him, yes, to those not committing sin that incurs death. There is a sin that does incur death. It is concerning that sin that I do not tell him to make request. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and yet there is a sin that does not incur death.\n18 We know that everyone who has been born from God does not practice sin, but the one born from God watches him, and the wicked one cannot take hold of him. 19 We know that we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. 20 But we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us insight so that we may gain the knowledge of the one who is true. And we are in union with the one who is true, by means of his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and life everlasting. 21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols. \n",

And in all the things that they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals, they go on corrupting themselves.\n11 Too bad for them, for they have followed the path of Cain and have rushed into the erroneous course of Balaam for reward, and they have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah! 12 These are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts while they feast with you, shepherds who feed themselves without fear; waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind; fruitless trees in late autumn, having died twice and having been uprooted; 13 wild waves of the sea that cast up the foam of their own shame; stars with no set course, for which the blackest darkness stands reserved forever.\n14 Yes, the seventh one in line from Adam, Enoch, also prophesied about them when he said: \"Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads 15 to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.\"\n16 These men are murmurers, complainers about their lot in life, following their own desires, and their mouths make grandiose boasts, while they are flattering others for their own benefit.\n17 As for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 18 how they used to say to you: \"In the last time there will be ridiculers, following their own desires for ungodly things.\" 19 These are the ones who cause divisions, animalistic men, not having spirituality. 20 But you, beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, and pray with holy spirit, 21 in order to keep yourselves in God's love, while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view. 22 Also, continue showing mercy to some who have doubts; 23 save them by snatching them out of the fire. But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the garment that has been stained by the flesh.\n24 Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to make you stand unblemished in the sight of his glory with great joy, 25 to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity.

    "text": "Joshua\nChapter 1\n1 After the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah said to Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses: 2 \"Moses my servant is dead. Now get up, cross the Jordan, you and all this people, and go into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel. 3 I will give you every place on which you set your foot, just as I promised Moses. 4 Your territory will extend from the wilderness up to Lebanon and to the great river, the Euphrates-all the land of the Hittites-and to the Great Sea on the west. 5 No one will be able to take a stand against you as long as you live. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will neither desert you nor abandon you. 6 Be courageous and strong, for you are the one who will cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their forefathers I would give to them.\n7 \"Only be courageous and very strong, and observe carefully the entire Law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not deviate from it either to the right or to the left, so that you may act wisely wherever you go. 8 This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone day and night, in order to observe carefully all that is written in it; for then your way will be successful and then you will act wisely. 9 Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and strong. Do not be struck with terror or fear, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.\"\n10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people: 11 \"Pass throughout the camp and give this command to the people, 'Get provisions ready, because in three days you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.'\"\n12 And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said: 13 \"Remember what Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you: 'Jehovah your God is giving you rest and has given you this land. 14 Your wives, your children, and your livestock will dwell in the land that Moses has given you on this side of the Jordan, but all you mighty warriors should cross over in battle formation ahead of your brothers. You must help them 15 until Jehovah gives your brothers rest, just as he has given you, and they also take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving them. Then return to the land you were given to occupy and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on the east side of the Jordan.'\"\n16 They answered Joshua: \"We will do all that you have commanded, and we will go wherever you send us. 17 Just as we listened to everything Moses said, so we will listen to you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you just as he was with Moses. 18 Any man who rebels against your order and does not obey every command you give him will be put to death. Only be courageous and strong.\"\nChapter 2\n1 Then Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out from Shittim as spies. He told them: \"Go and inspect the land, especially Jericho.\" So they went and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, and they stayed there. 2 The king of Jericho was told: \"Look! Israelite men have come in here tonight to spy out the land.\" 3 At that the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab: \"Bring out the men who came and are staying in your house, for they have come to spy out the entire land.\"\n4 But the woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said: \"Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. 5 And at dark when the city gate was about to be closed, the men went out. I do not know where the men went, but if you quickly chase after them, you will catch up with them.\" 6 (However, she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among stalks of flax laid in rows on the roof.) 7 So the men chased after them in the direction of the Jordan at the fords, and the city gate was shut once the pursuers had gone out.\n8 Before the men lay down to sleep, she came up to them on the roof. 9 She said to the men: \"I do know that Jehovah will give you the land and that the fear of you has fallen upon us. All the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of you, 10 for we heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction on the other side of the Jordan. 11 When we heard about it, we lost heart, and no one has any courage because of you, for Jehovah your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. 12 Now, please, swear to me by Jehovah that, because I showed loyal love to you, you will also show loyal love to my father's household; and you must give me a sign of good faith. 13 You must spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and you must save us from death.\"\n14 At that the men said to her: \"We will give our lives for yours! If you do not tell about our mission, then we will show loyal love and faithfulness toward you when Jehovah gives us the land.\" 15 After that she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on a side of the city wall. In fact, she was dwelling on the wall. 16 Then she said to them: \"Go to the mountainous region and hide there for three days, so that those pursuing you may not find you. Then, after your pursuers have come back, you can go on your way.\"\n17 The men said to her: \"We will be free from guilt respecting this oath that you made us swear 18 unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window by which you let us down. You should gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household with you into the house. 19 Then if anyone goes out the doors of your house into the open, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be free from guilt. But if harm comes to anyone who remains with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads. 20 But if you report our mission, we will be free from guilt respecting your oath that you made us swear.\" 21 She replied: \"Let it be according to your words.\"\nWith that she sent them off, and they went their way. Afterward, she tied the scarlet cord in the window. 22 So they left and went to the mountainous region and stayed there for three days, until the pursuers returned. The pursuers had been looking for them on every road but did not find them. 23 The two men then descended from the mountainous region and crossed the river and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They related to him all the things that had happened to them. 24 Then they said to Joshua: \"Jehovah has handed over the entire land to us. In fact, all the inhabitants of the land are disheartened because of us.\"\nChapter 3\n1 Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and he and all the Israelites departed from Shittim and came to the Jordan. They spent the night there before crossing over.\n2 After three days, the officers passed throughout the camp 3 and commanded the people: \"As soon as you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you should depart from your place and follow it. 4 But keep a distance of about 2,000 cubits from it; do not come any nearer to it, so that you may know which is the way to go, for you have not traveled on this way before.\"\n5 Joshua now said to the people: \"Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you.\"\n6 Then Joshua said to the priests: \"Take up the ark of the covenant and pass ahead of the people.\" So they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.\n7 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: \"This day I will start to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you just as I was with Moses. 8 You should give this command to the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: 'When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you should stand still in the Jordan.'\"\n9 And Joshua said to the Israelites: \"Come here and listen to the words of Jehovah your God.\" 10 Joshua then said: \"By this you will know that a living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive away from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 11 Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth is passing ahead of you into the Jordan. 12 Now take 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe, 13 and as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the Ark of Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth, touch the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from upstream will be halted and they will stand still like a dam.\"\n14 So when the people departed from their tents just before crossing the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of the people. 15 As soon as the carriers of the Ark reached the Jordan and the priests carrying the Ark dipped their feet into the edge of the waters (now the Jordan overflows its banks all the days of harvest), 16 the waters flowing from upstream stood still. They rose up like a dam very far away at Adam, the city near Zarethan, while the waters descending toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, drained away. They were halted, and the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 17 While the priests carrying the ark of Jehovah's covenant kept standing still on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, all Israel crossed over on dry ground until the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan.\nChapter 4\n1 As soon as the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, Jehovah said to Joshua: 2 \"Take 12 men from the people, one man from each tribe, 3 and give them this command: 'Take up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood still, and carry them over with you and set them down in the place where you will spend the night.'\"\n4 So Joshua called the 12 men whom he had appointed from the Israelites, one man from each tribe, 5 and Joshua said to them: \"Pass ahead of the Ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each of you should lift up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, 6 to serve as a sign among you. If your children should later ask you, 'Why do you have these stones?' 7 you must tell them: 'Because the waters of the Jordan were halted from before the ark of Jehovah's covenant. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were halted. These stones will serve as a lasting memorial to the people of Israel.'\"\n8 So the Israelites did just as Joshua had commanded. They took up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as Jehovah had instructed Joshua, to correspond to the number of the tribes of the Israelites. They took them over to the place where they would spend the night and set them down there.\n9 Joshua also set up 12 stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood, and the stones are there to this day.\n10 The priests carrying the Ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Jehovah had ordered Joshua to tell the people to do was completed, in harmony with all that Moses had commanded Joshua. All the while, the people hurried across. 11 As soon as all the people had finished crossing over, the Ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over in the sight of the people. 12 And the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle formation ahead of the other Israelites, just as Moses had instructed them. 13 About 40,000 soldiers armed for battle crossed over before Jehovah onto the desert plains of Jericho.\n14 On that day Jehovah exalted Joshua in the eyes of all Israel, and they deeply respected him all the days of his life, just as they had deeply respected Moses.\n15 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: 16 \"Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.\" 17 So Joshua commanded the priests: \"Come up out of the Jordan.\" 18 When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the middle of the Jordan and the soles of the feet of the priests stepped onto dry ground, the waters of the Jordan resumed their course and overflowed the banks as before.\n19 The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.\n20 As for the 12 stones that they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set these up at Gilgal. 21 Then he said to the Israelites: \"In the future when your children ask their fathers, 'What do these stones mean?' 22 you must explain to your children: 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry land 23 when Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before them until they had crossed it, just as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we crossed it. 24 He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know how mighty Jehovah's hand is and so that you may always fear Jehovah your God.'\"\nChapter 5\n1 As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, they lost heart, and they lost all courage because of the Israelites.\n2 At that time Jehovah said to Joshua: \"Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise the men of Israel again, a second time.\" 3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the men of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. 4 This is why Joshua circumcised them: All the males of the people who left Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the journey after they left Egypt. 5 All the people who left Egypt were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey after they left Egypt were not circumcised. 6 The Israelites had walked for 40 years in the wilderness until the entire nation had died off, that is, the men of war who left Egypt who did not obey the voice of Jehovah. Jehovah swore to them that he would never let them see the land that Jehovah had sworn to their forefathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 7 So he raised up their sons instead of them. These Joshua circumcised; they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them during the journey.\n8 When they finished circumcising the entire nation, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered.\n9 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: \"Today I have rolled away from you the reproach of Egypt.\" So that place has been called Gilgal until this day.\n10 The Israelites continued to camp at Gilgal, and they observed the Passover on the 14th day of the month, in the evening, on the desert plains of Jericho. 11 And they began to eat the produce of the land the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grains, on this same day. 12 And the manna stopped on the following day when they had eaten some of the produce of the land; there was no longer manna for the Israelites, but they began to eat the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.\n13 When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua walked up to him and asked: \"Are you on our side or on the side of our adversaries?\" 14 To this he said: \"No, but I have come as prince of Jehovah's army.\" With that Joshua fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and said to him: \"What does my lord have to say to his servant?\" 15 The prince of Jehovah's army replied to Joshua: \"Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy.\" At once Joshua did so.\nChapter 6\n1 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites; no one was leaving and no one was entering.\n2 Jehovah then said to Joshua: \"See, I have handed over to you Jericho and its king and its mighty warriors. 3 All you fighting men should march around the city, going around the city once. That is what you should do for six days. 4 Have seven priests carry seven ram's horns before the Ark. But on the seventh day, you should march around the city seven times and the priests should blow the horns. 5 When the ram's horn is sounded-as soon as you hear the sound of the horn-all the people should shout a great war cry. Then the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people must go up, each one straight ahead.\"\n6 So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests together and told them: \"Take up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests should carry seven ram's horns before the Ark of Jehovah.\" 7 Then he told the people: \"Move on and march around the city, and the armed troops should go ahead of the Ark of Jehovah.\" 8 And just as Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying seven ram's horns before Jehovah went forward and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah was following them. 9 And the armed troops went ahead of the priests who were blowing the horns, and the rear guard followed the Ark as the horns were blown continuously.\n10 Now Joshua had commanded the people: \"Do not shout nor let your voices be heard. Not a word should come out of your mouths until the day I say to you, 'Shout!' Then shout.\" 11 He had the Ark of Jehovah go around the city, going around it once, after which they returned to the camp and spent the night there.\n12 The next morning Joshua got up early, and the priests took up the Ark of Jehovah, 13 and seven priests carrying seven ram's horns walked before the Ark of Jehovah, continuously blowing the horns. The armed troops were walking ahead of them while the rear guard was following the Ark of Jehovah as the horns were blown continuously. 14 They marched around the city on the second day once, after which they returned to the camp. That was what they did for six days.\n15 On the seventh day they got up early, as soon as the dawn broke, and they marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. 16 And on the seventh time, the priests blew the horns, and Joshua told the people: \"Shout, for Jehovah has given you the city! 17 The city and everything in it is to be devoted to destruction; it all belongs to Jehovah. Only Rahab the prostitute may keep living, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers we sent out. 18 But keep away from what is devoted to destruction, so that you do not desire something devoted to destruction and take it, making the camp of Israel something devoted to destruction by bringing disaster on it. 19 But all the silver and the gold and the articles of copper and iron are holy to Jehovah. They should go into the treasury of Jehovah.\"\n20 Then the people shouted when the horns were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the horn and shouted a great war cry, the wall fell down flat. After that the people went up into the city, each one straight ahead, and they captured the city. 21 They devoted all that was in the city to destruction by the sword, man and woman, young and old, bull, sheep, and donkey.\n22 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land: \"Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.\" 23 So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, along with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all who belonged to her; yes, they brought out her whole family, and they brought them safely to a place outside the camp of Israel.\n24 Then they burned the city and everything in it with fire. But the silver, the gold, and the articles of copper and iron, they gave to the treasury of Jehovah's house. 25 Only Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belonged to her were spared by Joshua; and she lives in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent out to spy on Jericho.\n26 At that time Joshua pronounced this oath: \"Cursed be the man before Jehovah who undertakes to rebuild this city of Jericho. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will put up its doors.\"\n27 So Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame spread through all the earth.\nChapter 7\n1 But the Israelites were unfaithful with regard to what had been devoted to destruction, for Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was devoted to destruction. At this Jehovah's anger blazed against the Israelites.\n2 Then Joshua sent men out from Jericho to Ai, which is close by Beth-aven and east of Bethel, telling them: \"Go up and spy on the land.\" So the men went up and spied on Ai. 3 When they returned to Joshua, they told him: \"Not all the people need to go up. About two or three thousand men are enough to defeat Ai. Do not tire out all the people by making them go, for there are only a few of them.\"\n4 So about 3,000 men went up there, but they had to flee from the men of Ai. 5 The men of Ai struck down 36 men, and they pursued them from outside the city gate as far as Shebarim, and they continued striking them down on the descent. So the courage of the people melted and flowed away like water.\n6 At this Joshua ripped his garments and fell with his face to the ground before the Ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they kept throwing dust on their heads. 7 Joshua said: \"Alas, Sovereign Lord Jehovah, why did you bring this people all the way across the Jordan just to hand us over to the Amorites to be destroyed? If only we had been satisfied to remain on the other side of the Jordan! 8 Pardon me, O Jehovah, what can I say now that Israel has retreated before his enemies? 9 When the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land hear about it, they will surround us and wipe out our very name from the earth, and what will you do about your great name?\"\n10 Jehovah replied to Joshua: \"Get up! Why are you lying on your face? 11 Israel has sinned. They have violated my covenant that I commanded them to keep. They took some of what was devoted to destruction, stealing it and secretly putting it among their own possessions. 12 Therefore, the Israelites will not be able to stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and flee from their enemies, because they have become something devoted to destruction. I will not be with you again unless you annihilate from your midst what was devoted to destruction. 13 Get up and sanctify the people! Tell them, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: \"What is devoted to destruction is among you, O Israel. You will not be able to stand against your enemies until you remove from your midst the thing devoted to destruction. 14 You are to present yourselves in the morning, tribe by tribe, and the tribe that Jehovah selects will come near, family by family, and the family that Jehovah selects will come near, household by household, and the household that Jehovah selects will come near, man by man. 15 And the one who is caught with the thing devoted to destruction will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has violated the covenant of Jehovah and because he has committed a disgraceful act in Israel.\"'\"\n16 So Joshua rose early the next morning and had Israel come near, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected. 17 He had the families of Judah come near and the family of the Zerahites was selected, after which he had the family of the Zerahites come near, man by man, and Zabdi was selected. 18 Finally he had the household of Zabdi come near, man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected. 19 Then Joshua said to Achan: \"My son, please, honor Jehovah the God of Israel and make confession to him. Tell me, please, what you have done. Do not hide it from me.\"\n20 Achan answered Joshua: \"For a fact I am the one who sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and this is what I have done. 21 When I saw among the spoil a good-looking official garment from Shinar and 200 shekels of silver and one gold bar weighing 50 shekels, I desired them, so I took them. They are now hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the money underneath.\"\n22 At once Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there the garment was hidden in his tent, with the money underneath it. 23 So they took the things out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and placed them before Jehovah. 24 Joshua and all Israel with him then took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the official garment, and the bar of gold, along with his sons, his daughters, his bull, his donkey, his flock, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor. 25 Joshua said: \"Why have you brought disaster upon us? Jehovah will bring disaster upon you on this day.\" With that all Israel stoned him, after which they burned them with fire. Thus they stoned all of them. 26 And they raised a huge pile of stones over him that remains to this day. At this Jehovah's hot anger subsided. That is why the name of that place is Valley of Achor to this day.\nChapter 8\n1 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: \"Do not be afraid or be terrified. Take with you all the fighting men and go up against Ai. See, I have handed over to you the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. 2 Do to Ai and to its king just as you did to Jericho and its king, except you may plunder its spoil and its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.\"\n3 So Joshua and all the fighting men went up against Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty warriors and sent them off by night. 4 He gave them this command: \"See, you are to lie in ambush behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, and all of you be ready. 5 I and all the people with me will approach the city, and when they come out against us as before, we will retreat from them. 6 When they come out after us, we will draw them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are retreating from us just as before.' And we will retreat from them. 7 Then you should rise up from the ambush and capture the city; Jehovah your God will hand it over to you. 8 As soon as you have seized the city, you should set it on fire. You should do according to Jehovah's word. See, I have given you your orders.\"\n9 Then Joshua sent them out, and they marched to the place of ambush; they took a position between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, while Joshua spent that night with the people.\n10 After Joshua rose up early in the morning and gathered the troops, he and the elders of Israel led them to Ai. 11 All the fighting men who were with him marched up and advanced to the front of the city. They camped to the north of Ai, with the valley between them and Ai. 12 In the meantime, he had taken about 5,000 men and had set them as an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 13 So the people set the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard west of the city, and Joshua went that night into the middle of the valley.\n14 And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush set against him to the rear of the city. 15 When the men of Ai attacked, Joshua and all Israel fled along the road in the direction of the wilderness. 16 Then all the people who were in the city were summoned to pursue them; and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city. 17 Not a man was remaining in Ai and Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city wide open and pursued Israel.\n18 Jehovah now said to Joshua: \"Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for into your hand I will give it.\" So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city. 19 The moment he stretched out his hand, the ambush rose up quickly from its place and ran into the city and captured it. They immediately set the city on fire.\n20 When the men of Ai turned around, they saw the smoke of the city rising to the sky, and they had no strength to flee in any direction. Then the people who had been fleeing toward the wilderness turned on their pursuers. 21 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and saw the smoke of the city rising, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. 22 And the others came out of the city to meet them, so that the men of Ai were trapped in the middle, with some Israelites on this side and some on that side, and they struck them down until there was not one survivor or escapee remaining. 23 But they caught the king of Ai alive and brought him before Joshua.\n24 After Israel finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they had pursued them, and every last one of them had fallen by the sword, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the sword. 25 All those who fell on that day, from man to woman, amounted to 12,000, all the people of Ai. 26 Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he had stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction. 27 However, Israel took the livestock and the spoil of that city for themselves, according to the orders that Jehovah had given to Joshua.\n28 Then Joshua burned Ai and reduced it to a permanent mound of ruins, as it remains to this day. 29 He hung the king of Ai on a stake until the evening, and as the sun was about to set, Joshua gave the order to take his dead body down from the stake. Then they pitched it at the entrance of the city gate and raised up a great pile of stones over him, which is there to this day.\n30 It was then that Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to Jehovah the God of Israel, 31 just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the Israelites and as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses: \"An altar of whole stones on which no iron tool has been wielded.\" On it they offered up burnt offerings to Jehovah as well as communion sacrifices.\n32 Then he wrote there on the stones a copy of the Law that Moses had written before the Israelites. 33 All Israel, their elders, the officers, and their judges were standing on both sides of the Ark in front of the Levitical priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. The foreign residents were there as well as the natives. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim, and the other half in front of Mount Ebal (just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had previously commanded), to bless the people of Israel. 34 After this he read aloud all the words of the Law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the book of the Law. 35 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read aloud in front of all the congregation of Israel, including the women and children and the foreign residents who were living among them.\nChapter 9\n1 When all the kings who were on the west side of the Jordan heard what had happened, those in the mountainous region, in the Shephelah, along the entire coast of the Great Sea, and in front of Lebanon-the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites- 2 they formed an alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.\n3 The inhabitants of Gibeon also heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai. 4 So they acted shrewdly and put provisions into worn-out sacks on their donkeys, along with worn-out wineskins that had burst and had been mended; 5 they also had worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and they were wearing worn-out garments. All the bread of their provisions was dry and crumbly. 6 Then they went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel: \"We have come from a distant land. Now make a covenant with us.\" 7 But the men of Israel said to the Hivites: \"Perhaps you are living near us. So how can we make a covenant with you?\" 8 They replied to Joshua: \"We are your servants.\"\nThen Joshua said to them: \"Who are you, and where do you come from?\" 9 At this they said to him: \"Your servants have come from a very distant land out of regard for the name of Jehovah your God, because we have heard about his fame and about all he did in Egypt 10 and about all he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth. 11 So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us, 'Take provisions with you for the journey and go to meet them. Tell them: \"We will be your servants; now make a covenant with us.\"' 12 This bread that we took as our provisions was still hot on the day we left our houses to come here to you. Now you can see it is dry and crumbly. 13 And these wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they have burst. And our garments and sandals have worn out because of the great length of the journey.\"\n14 At that the men took some of their provisions, but they did not inquire of Jehovah. 15 So Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them to let them live, and that is what the chieftains of the assembly swore to them in an oath.\n16 At the end of three days, after they made a covenant with them, they heard that they lived nearby, in their vicinity. 17 Then the Israelites set out and came to their cities on the third day; their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 18 But the Israelites did not attack them, because the chieftains of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. So all the assembly began to murmur against the chieftains. 19 At this all the chieftains said to the entire assembly: \"Since we swore an oath to them by Jehovah the God of Israel, we are not allowed to hurt them. 20 This is what we will do: We will let them live, so that there is no indignation against us because of the oath that we swore to them.\" 21 And the chieftains added: \"Let them live, but let them become gatherers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly.\" This is what the chieftains promised them.\n22 Joshua now called them and said to them: \"Why did you trick us by saying, 'We are from a place very far away from you,' when you really live right among us? 23 From now on you are cursed, and you will always occupy a slave's position as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.\" 24 They answered Joshua: \"It was because your servants were plainly told that Jehovah your God had commanded Moses his servant to give you all the land and to annihilate all its inhabitants from before you. So we were afraid for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this. 25 Now we are at your mercy. Do to us whatever you think is good and right.\" 26 And that is what he did with them; he saved them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill them. 27 But that day Joshua made them gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah's altar at the place that He should choose, and they remain so to this day.\nChapter 10\n1 As soon as King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and devoted it to destruction, doing to Ai and its king just as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and remained among them, 2 he was greatly alarmed, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities. It was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors. 3 So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent this message to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon: 4 \"Come to my aid, and let us attack Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.\" 5 At this the five kings of the Amorites-the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon-gathered together along with their armies, and they marched on and encamped against Gibeon to fight against it.\n6 Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal: \"Do not forsake your slaves. Come quickly! Rescue us and help us! All the kings of the Amorites from the mountainous region have gathered against us.\" 7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal with all the fighting men and the mighty warriors.\n8 Jehovah then said to Joshua: \"Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will be able to stand against you.\" 9 Joshua came against them by surprise after marching all night long from Gilgal. 10 Jehovah threw them into confusion before Israel, and they inflicted a great slaughter on them at Gibeon, pursuing them by way of the ascent of Beth-horon and striking them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. 11 While they were fleeing from Israel and were on the descent of Beth-horon, Jehovah hurled great hailstones from the sky on them as far as Azekah, and they perished. In fact, more died from the hail than from the sword of the Israelites.\n12 It was then, on the day that Jehovah routed the Amorites before the eyes of the Israelites, that Joshua said to Jehovah before Israel:\n\"Sun, stand still over Gibeon,\nAnd moon, over the Valley of Aijalon!\"\n13 So the sun stood still and the moon did not move until the nation could take vengeance on its enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? The sun stood still in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to set for about a whole day. 14 There has never been a day like that one, either before it or after it, when Jehovah listened to the voice of a man, for Jehovah was fighting for Israel.\n15 After that Joshua together with all Israel returned to the camp at Gilgal.\n16 Meanwhile, the five kings fled and hid in the cave at Makkedah. 17 Then it was reported to Joshua: \"The five kings have been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah.\" 18 So Joshua said: \"Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave and assign men to guard them. 19 But the rest of you should not stop. Pursue your enemies and strike them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities, for Jehovah your God has given them into your hands.\"\n20 After Joshua and the Israelites had finished inflicting a very great slaughter on them, to the point of wiping them out except for some survivors who escaped and entered into the fortified cities, 21 all the people returned safely to Joshua at the camp at Makkedah. Not a man dared to utter a word against the Israelites. 22 Then Joshua said: \"Open the mouth of the cave and bring the five kings out of the cave to me.\" 23 So they brought to him from the cave these five kings: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 24 When they brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the fighting men who had gone with him: \"Come forward. Place your feet on the backs of the necks of these kings.\" So they came forward and placed their feet on the backs of their necks. 25 Then Joshua said to them: \"Do not be afraid or be terrified. Be courageous and strong, for this is what Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you are fighting.\"\n26 Then Joshua struck them and put them to death and hung them on five stakes, and they remained hanging on the stakes until the evening. 27 At sunset Joshua ordered that they be taken down off the stakes and thrown into the cave where they had hidden themselves. Then large stones were placed at the mouth of the cave, and these remain to this very day.\n28 Joshua captured Makkedah on that day and struck it with the sword. He devoted its king and everyone in it to destruction, letting no survivor remain. He did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.\n29 Then Joshua together with all Israel went from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah. 30 Jehovah also gave it and its king into Israel's hand, and they struck it and everyone in it with the sword, not letting a survivor remain in it. So they did to its king just as they had done to the king of Jericho.\n31 Next Joshua together with all Israel went from Libnah to Lachish and camped there and fought against it. 32 Jehovah gave Lachish into Israel's hand, and they captured it on the second day. They struck it and everyone in it with the sword, just as they had done to Libnah.\n33 Then Horam king of Gezer went up to help Lachish, but Joshua struck him and his people down until not one survivor remained.\n34 Then Joshua together with all Israel went from Lachish to Eglon and camped there and fought against it. 35 They captured it on that day and struck it with the sword. They devoted everyone in it to destruction on that day, just as they had done to Lachish.\n36 Then Joshua together with all Israel went up from Eglon to Hebron and fought against it. 37 They captured it and struck it, its king, its towns, and everyone in it with the sword, not letting any survivor remain. Just as he had done to Eglon, he devoted it and everyone in it to destruction.\n38 Finally Joshua together with all Israel turned toward Debir and fought against it. 39 He captured it, its king, and all its towns, and they struck them down with the sword, devoting everyone in it to destruction, not letting any survivor remain. He did to Debir and its king just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king.\n40 Joshua conquered all the land of the mountainous region, the Negeb, the Shephelah, and the slopes, and all their kings, not letting any survivor remain; he devoted everything that breathed to destruction, just as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded. 41 Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza and all the land of Goshen and up to Gibeon. 42 Joshua captured all these kings and their land, all at the same time, because it was Jehovah the God of Israel who was fighting for Israel. 43 Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.\nChapter 11\n1 As soon as Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, the king of Achshaph, 2 the kings who were in the northern mountainous region, those in the plains south of Chinnereth, those in the Shephelah and on the slopes of Dor to the west, 3 the Canaanites to the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites in the mountainous region, and the Hivites at the base of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 4 So they came out with all their armies, a vast multitude as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore, together with very many horses and war chariots. 5 All these kings agreed to meet, and they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.\n6 At this Jehovah said to Joshua: \"Do not be afraid because of them, for about this time tomorrow, I am giving over all of them slain to Israel. Their horses you must hamstring, and their chariots you must burn in the fire.\" 7 Joshua together with all the fighting men then launched a surprise attack against them along the waters of Merom. 8 Jehovah gave them into Israel's hand, and they defeated them and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the Valley of Mizpeh to the east, and they struck them down until no survivors remained. 9 Joshua then did to them just as Jehovah had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots in the fire.\n10 Moreover, Joshua then returned and captured Hazor and struck down its king with the sword, because Hazor had formerly been the head of all these kingdoms. 11 They struck down everyone in it with the sword, devoting them to destruction. Not a breathing thing was left. Then he burned Hazor in the fire. 12 Joshua captured all the cities of these kings and defeated all their kings with the sword. He devoted them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded. 13 However, Israel did not burn any of the cities that stood on their mounds except Hazor; it was the only one Joshua burned. 14 All the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the Israelites plundered for themselves. But they struck every human with the sword until they had annihilated each one. They did not let anyone who breathed remain. 15 Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n16 Joshua conquered all this land, the mountainous region, all the Negeb, all the land of Goshen, the Shephelah, the Arabah, and the mountainous region of Israel and its Shephelah, 17 from Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, and as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the base of Mount Hermon, and he captured all their kings and defeated them, putting them to death. 18 Joshua waged war with all these kings for quite some time. 19 There was no city that made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites inhabiting Gibeon. They conquered all the others by war. 20 It was Jehovah who allowed their hearts to become stubborn so that they waged war against Israel, in order for him to devote them to destruction without any favorable consideration. They were to be annihilated, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n21 At that time Joshua wiped out the Anakim from the mountainous region, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the mountainous region of Judah and all the mountainous region of Israel. Joshua devoted them and their cities to destruction. 22 There were no Anakim left in the land of the Israelites; they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod. 23 So Joshua took control of all the land, just as Jehovah had promised Moses, and then Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel by their shares to be divided among their tribes. And the land had rest from war.\nChapter 12\n1 Now these are the kings of the land whom the Israelites defeated, whose land they took possession of on the east side of the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley up to Mount Hermon and all the Arabah toward the east: 2 King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which was on the rim of the Arnon Valley, and from the middle of the valley, and half of Gilead as far as the Valley of Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites. 3 He also ruled over the Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinnereth toward the east and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, to the east in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth, and toward the south under the slopes of Pisgah.\n4 Also the territory of King Og of Bashan, who was one of the last of the Rephaim and who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei 5 and ruled in Mount Hermon, in Salecah, and in all Bashan, as far as the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, to the territory of King Sihon of Heshbon.\n6 Moses the servant of Jehovah and the Israelites defeated them, after which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave their land as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.\n7 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon and as far as Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, after which Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession by their shares, 8 in the mountainous region, in the Shephelah, in the Arabah, on the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the Negeb-the land of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:\n9 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which was beside Bethel, one;\n10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;\n11 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;\n12 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;\n13 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;\n14 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;\n15 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;\n16 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;\n17 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;\n18 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;\n19 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;\n20 the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;\n21 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;\n22 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;\n23 the king of Dor on the slopes of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;\n24 the king of Tirzah, one; a total of 31 kings.\nChapter 13\n1 Now Joshua had grown old and was advanced in years. So Jehovah said to him: \"You have grown old and are advanced in years; but much of the land remains to be taken in possession. 2 This is the land remaining: all the regions of the Philistines and all the Geshurites 3 (from the branch of the Nile that is east of Egypt up to the border of Ekron to the north, which used to be considered Canaanite territory) including that of the five lords of the Philistines-the Gazites, the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; that of the Avvim 4 to the south; all the land of the Canaanites; Mearah, which belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites; 5 the land of the Gebalites and all of Lebanon toward the east, from Baal-gad at the base of Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath; 6 all the inhabitants of the mountainous region from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim; and all the Sidonians. I will drive them out before the Israelites. You have only to assign it to Israel as an inheritance, just as I have commanded you. 7 Now you must apportion this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh.\"\n8 With the other half tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites took their inheritance that Moses gave them on the east side of the Jordan, just as Moses the servant of Jehovah had given them: 9 from Aroer, which is on the rim of the Arnon Valley, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon; 10 and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, up to the border of the Ammonites; 11 also Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and all Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salecah; 12 all the royal realm of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. (He was one of the last of the Rephaim.) Moses defeated them and drove them out. 13 But the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites and the Maacathites, for Geshur and Maacath live in the midst of Israel to this day.\n14 It was only to the tribe of the Levites that he did not give an inheritance. The offerings made by fire to Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance, just as he promised them.\n15 Then Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reubenites by their families, 16 and their territory was from Aroer, which is on the rim of the Arnon Valley, and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba; 17 Heshbon and all its towns on the tableland, Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, 18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the mountain of the valley, 20 Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth, 21 all the cities of the tableland, and all the royal realm of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. Moses defeated him and the Midianite chieftains Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, vassals of Sihon who were dwelling in the land. 22 Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, was one whom the Israelites killed with the sword along with the rest who were slain. 23 The boundary of the Reubenites was the Jordan; and this territory was the inheritance of the Reubenites by their families, with the cities and their settlements.\n24 Furthermore, Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, the Gadites by their families, 25 and their territory included Jazer and all the cities of Gilead and half of the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, which faces Rabbah; 26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; 27 and in the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the royal realm of King Sihon of Heshbon, with the Jordan as the border from the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth on the east side of the Jordan. 28 This was the inheritance of the Gadites by their families, with the cities and their settlements.\n29 Further, Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh, to half of the tribe of Manasseh by their families. 30 And their territory extended from Mahanaim and took in all of Bashan, all the royal realm of King Og of Bashan, and all the tent villages of Jair in Bashan, 60 towns. 31 And half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the royal realm of Og in Bashan, went to the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, to half of the sons of Machir by their families.\n32 These were the inheritances that Moses gave them on the desert plains of Moab beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho.\n33 But to the tribe of the Levites, Moses did not give an inheritance. Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he promised them.\nChapter 14\n1 Now this is what the Israelites took as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel gave them to inherit. 2 Their inheritance was by lot, just as Jehovah had commanded through Moses for the nine and a half tribes. 3 Moses had given the inheritance of the other two and a half tribes on the other side of the Jordan, and to the Levites he did not give an inheritance among them. 4 The descendants of Joseph were considered two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and they did not give a share in the land to the Levites, except cities to dwell in and their pastures for their livestock and their property. 5 So the Israelites apportioned the land just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n6 Then the men of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: \"You well know what Jehovah said to Moses the man of the true God about you and me at Kadesh-barnea. 7 I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me out of Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I returned with a forthright report. 8 Although my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart, I followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly. 9 Moses swore on that day, saying: 'The land on which your foot has walked will become a lasting inheritance for you and your sons, because you have followed Jehovah my God wholeheartedly.' 10 Now just as he promised, Jehovah has preserved me alive these 45 years since Jehovah made this promise to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness; I am still here today, 85 years old. 11 And today I am as strong as on the day Moses sent me out. My strength is now as it was then, for war and for other activities. 12 Therefore, give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day. Though you heard on that day that there were Anakim there with great fortified cities, surely Jehovah will be with me, and I will drive them out, just as Jehovah promised.\"\n13 So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. 14 That is why Hebron belongs to Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance to this day, because he followed Jehovah the God of Israel wholeheartedly. 15 The name of Hebron was previously Kiriath-arba (Arba was the great man among the Anakim). And the land had rest from war.\nChapter 15\n1 The land allotted to the tribe of Judah for their families extended to the boundary of Edom, the wilderness of Zin, to the Negeb at its southern end. 2 Their southern boundary ran from the extremity of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. 3 And it extended south to the ascent of Akrabbim, passed over to Zin, then went up from the south to Kadesh-barnea, over to Hezron, up to Addar, and went around toward Karka. 4 Then it passed on to Azmon and extended to the Wadi of Egypt, and the boundary ended at the Sea. This was their southern boundary.\n5 The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea up to the end of the Jordan, and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea, at the end of the Jordan. 6 The boundary went up to Beth-hoglah and passed over at the north of Beth-arabah, and the boundary went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 7 The boundary went up to Debir at the Valley of Achor and turned northward to Gilgal, which is in front of the ascent of Adummim that is south of the wadi, and the boundary passed over to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 8 The boundary went up to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite at the south, that is, Jerusalem, and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the Valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the extremity of the Valley of Rephaim to the north. 9 And the boundary was marked from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and extended to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the boundary was marked to Baalah, that is, Kiriath-jearim. 10 The boundary went around from Baalah westward to Mount Seir and passed over to the slope of Mount Jearim at the north, that is, Chesalon, and it went down to Beth-shemesh and passed over to Timnah. 11 And the boundary extended to the slope of Ekron to the north, and the boundary was marked to Shikkeron and passed over to Mount Baalah and extended to Jabneel, and the boundary ended at the sea.\n12 The western boundary was at the Great Sea and its coast. This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah by their families on all sides.\n13 And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he gave a share among the descendants of Judah at the order of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kiriath-arba (Arba was the father of Anak), that is, Hebron. 14 So Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, descendants of Anak. 15 Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was previously Kiriath-sepher.) 16 Caleb then said: \"To the man who strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife.\" 17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 18 While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey. Caleb asked her: \"What do you want?\" 19 She said: \"Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south; give me also Gulloth-maim.\" So he gave her Upper Gulloth and Lower Gulloth.\n20 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Judah by their families.\n21 The cities at the extremity of the tribe of Judah toward the boundary of Edom in the south were: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 25 Hazor-hadattah, and Kerioth-hezron, that is, Hazor, 26 Amam, Shema, Moladah, 27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet, 28 Hazar-shual, Beer-sheba, Biziothiah, 29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon-a total of 29 cities together with their settlements.\n33 In the Shephelah, there were: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah and Gederothaim-14 cities and their settlements.\n37 Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad, 38 Dilean, Mizpeh, Joktheel, 39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 40 Cabbon, Lahmam, Chitlish, 41 Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah-16 cities and their settlements.\n42 Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah-nine cities and their settlements.\n45 Ekron and its dependent towns and its settlements; 46 from Ekron westward, all that is alongside Ashdod and their settlements.\n47 Ashdod, its dependent towns and its settlements; Gaza, its dependent towns and its settlements, down to the Wadi of Egypt, the Great Sea, and the adjacent region.\n48 And in the mountainous region, Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah, that is, Debir, 50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh-11 cities and their settlements.\n52 Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 53 Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah, 54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, and Zior-nine cities and their settlements.\n55 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah-ten cities and their settlements.\n58 Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor, 59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon-six cities and their settlements.\n60 Kiriath-baal, that is, Kiriath-jearim, and Rabbah-two cities and their settlements.\n61 In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah, 62 Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi-six cities and their settlements.\n63 As for the Jebusites who were dwelling in Jerusalem, the men of Judah were not able to drive them away, so the Jebusites continue dwelling with the people of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.\nChapter 16\n1 And the land that fell by lot to the descendants of Joseph was from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters east of Jericho, through the wilderness going up from Jericho into the mountainous region of Bethel. 2 It extended from Bethel belonging to Luz and continued to the boundary of the Archites at Ataroth, 3 then it went down westward to the boundary of the Japhletites as far as the boundary of Lower Beth-horon and Gezer, and it ended at the sea.\n4 So Joseph's descendants, Manasseh and Ephraim, took possession of their land. 5 The boundary of the descendants of Ephraim by their families was as follows: The boundary of their inheritance to the east was Ataroth-addar, as far as Upper Beth-horon, 6 and the boundary extended to the sea. Michmethath was on the north, and the boundary went around east to Taanath-shiloh, and it passed on the east to Janoah. 7 Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah and reached to Jericho and extended to the Jordan. 8 From Tappuah the boundary continued westward to the Wadi of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim by their families; 9 the descendants of Ephraim also had enclave cities in the midst of the inheritance of Manasseh, all the cities and their settlements.\n10 But they did not drive away the Canaanites who were dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanites continue to dwell among Ephraim to this day and have been subjected to forced labor.\nChapter 17\n1 Then the lot fell for the tribe of Manasseh, because he was Joseph's firstborn. Since Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh and the father of Gilead, was a man of war, he received Gilead and Bashan. 2 And the lot fell for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh according to their families, for the sons of Abi-ezer, the sons of Helek, the sons of Asriel, the sons of Shechem, the sons of Hepher, and the sons of Shemida. These were the descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the males according to their families. 3 But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, did not have sons, only daughters, and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 4 So they presented themselves before Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the chieftains, saying: \"It was Jehovah who commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.\" So at the order of Jehovah, he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.\n5 There were also ten allotments that fell to Manasseh apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan, 6 for the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons, and the land of Gilead became the property of the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.\n7 And the boundary of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which faces Shechem, and the boundary continued toward the south to the land of the inhabitants of En-Tappuah. 8 The land of Tappuah became Manasseh's, but Tappuah on Manasseh's boundary belonged to the descendants of Ephraim. 9 And the boundary went down to the Wadi of Kanah, south of the wadi. There were cities of Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, and the boundary of Manasseh was on the north of the wadi, and it ended at the sea. 10 To the south it belonged to Ephraim, and to the north it belonged to Manasseh, and the sea was his boundary, and on the north they reached to Asher, and on the east, to Issachar.\n11 In the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh was given Beth-shean and its dependent towns, Ibleam and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its dependent towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent towns, three of the heights.\n12 But the descendants of Manasseh were not able to take possession of these cities; the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in this land. 13 When the Israelites grew strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out entirely.\n14 The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua: \"Why have you given us as an inheritance only one lot and one allotment? We are a numerous people, for Jehovah has blessed us until now.\" 15 Joshua replied to them: \"If you are such a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the mountainous region of Ephraim is too cramped for you.\" 16 Then the descendants of Joseph said: \"The mountainous region is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who are dwelling in the land of the valley have war chariots with iron scythes, both those in Beth-shean and its dependent towns and those in the Valley of Jezreel.\" 17 So Joshua said this to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh: \"You are a numerous people, and you have great power. You will not receive only one lot, 18 but the mountainous region will also be yours. Although it is a forest, you will clear it, and it will be the extremity of your territory. For you will drive away the Canaanites, even though they are strong and have war chariots with iron scythes.\"\nChapter 18\n1 Then all the assembly of the Israelites congregated at Shiloh, and they set up the tent of meeting there, as the land was now subdued before them. 2 But there were still seven tribes left of the Israelites whose inheritance had not been allotted. 3 So Joshua said to the Israelites: \"How long will you put off going in to take possession of the land that Jehovah the God of your forefathers has given you? 4 Give me three men from each tribe to send out; they should go out and walk throughout the land and map it out according to their inheritance. Then they should return to me. 5 They must apportion it among themselves into seven shares. Judah will remain in his territory to the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their territory to the north. 6 As for you, map out the land into seven shares, and bring them here to me, and I will cast lots here for you before Jehovah our God. 7 But the Levites will not be given a share among you, because the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance; and Gad, Reuben, and the half tribe of Manasseh have already taken their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.\"\n8 The men prepared to go, and Joshua commanded those who were to map out the land: \"Go and walk through the land and map it out and return to me, and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.\" 9 With that the men went and traveled through the land and mapped it out by cities into seven shares, recording it in a book. After that they returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. 10 Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah. There Joshua apportioned the land to the Israelites by their shares.\n11 The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin by their families, and the territory of their lot was between the people of Judah and the people of Joseph. 12 On the north side, their boundary started at the Jordan, and the boundary went up to the slope of Jericho on the north and went up on the mountain westward, and it extended to the wilderness of Beth-aven. 13 And the boundary continued from there to Luz, at the southern slope of Luz, that is, Bethel; the boundary went down to Ataroth-addar on the mountain that is south of Lower Beth-horon. 14 And the boundary was marked at the western side and went around toward the south from the mountain that faces Beth-horon to the south; it ended at Kiriath-baal, that is, Kiriath-jearim, a city of Judah. This is the western side.\n15 The south side was from the extremity of Kiriath-jearim, and the boundary extended westward; it went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. 16 The boundary went down to the extremity of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is in the Valley of Rephaim to the north, and it went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite on the south, and down to En-rogel. 17 And it was marked northward and extended to En-shemesh and then out to Geliloth, which is in front of the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 18 And it continued to the northern slope in front of the Arabah and went down to the Arabah. 19 And the boundary continued to the northern slope of Beth-hoglah, and the boundary ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the southern boundary. 20 And the Jordan served as its boundary on the eastern side. This was the inheritance of the descendants of Benjamin by their families, according to its boundaries on all sides.\n21 And the cities of the tribe of Benjamin by their families were: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba-12 cities and their settlements.\n25 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 28 Zelah, Ha-eleph, Jebusi, that is, Jerusalem, Gibeah, and Kiriath-14 cities and their settlements.\nThis was the inheritance of the descendants of Benjamin by their families.\nChapter 19\n1 Then the second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of Simeon by their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of Judah. 2 Their inheritance was Beer-sheba with Sheba, Moladah, 3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen-13 cities and their settlements; 7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan-four cities and their settlements; 8 and all the settlements that were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon by their families. 9 The inheritance of the descendants of Simeon was taken out of the allotment of Judah, because the share of Judah was too large for them. So the descendants of Simeon received a possession within their inheritance.\n10 Next the third lot came up for the descendants of Zebulun by their families, and the boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sarid. 11 Their boundary went up westward to Mareal and reached to Dabbesheth and then to the valley in front of Jokneam. 12 And it went from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Chisloth-tabor and out to Daberath and then up to Japhia. 13 And from there it continued eastward toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and out to Rimmon, and it extended to Neah. 14 And the boundary went around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the Valley of Iphtah-el, 15 and Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem-12 cities and their settlements. 16 This was the inheritance of the descendants of Zebulun by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.\n17 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the descendants of Issachar by their families. 18 And their boundary was to Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 21 Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez. 22 And the boundary reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and the end of their border was at the Jordan-16 cities and their settlements. 23 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar by their families, the cities and their settlements.\n24 Then the fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher by their families. 25 And their boundary was Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. It reached westward to Carmel and to Shihor-libnath, 27 and it went back toward the east to Beth-dagon and reached to Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah-el to the north, to Beth-emek and Neiel, and it extended to Cabul on the left, 28 and to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah as far as Great Sidon. 29 And the boundary went back to Ramah and as far as the fortified city of Tyre. Then the boundary went back to Hosah, and it ended at the sea in the region of Achzib, 30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob-22 cities and their settlements. 31 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Asher by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.\n32 The sixth lot came out for the descendants of Naphtali, for the descendants of Naphtali by their families. 33 Their boundary was from Heleph, from the big tree in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel as far as Lakkum; and it ended at the Jordan. 34 The boundary went back westward to Aznoth-tabor and extended from there to Hukkok and reached to Zebulun on the south and to Asher on the west and to Judah at the Jordan toward the east. 35 And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 38 Yiron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh-19 cities and their settlements. 39 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali by their families, the cities and their settlements.\n40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan by their families. 41 And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 46 Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border facing Joppa. 47 But the territory of Dan was too cramped for them. So they went up and fought against Leshem and captured it and struck it with the sword. Then they took possession of it and settled in it, and they changed the name of Leshem to Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather. 48 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan by their families. These were the cities and their settlements.\n49 Thus they finished dividing the land for inheritance by its territories. Then the Israelites gave Joshua the son of Nun an inheritance in their midst. 50 At the order of Jehovah they gave him the city he asked for, Timnath-serah, in the mountainous region of Ephraim, and he built up the city and settled in it.\n51 These were the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. So they finished apportioning the land.\nChapter 20\n1 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: 2 \"Tell the Israelites, 'Select for yourselves the cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moses, 3 so that the manslayer who unintentionally or accidentally kills someone may flee there. And they will serve as a refuge for you from the avenger of blood. 4 He must flee to one of these cities and stand at the entrance of the city gate and present his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. Then they must receive him into the city and give him a place and he will live with them. 5 If the avenger of blood chases after him, they should not surrender the manslayer into his hand, for he killed his fellow man accidentally and he did not previously hate him. 6 He must dwell in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and remain there until the death of the high priest who is in office at that time. Then the manslayer may return to the city from which he fled, and he may enter his city and his house.'\"\n7 So they gave a sacred status to Kedesh in Galilee in the mountainous region of Naphtali, Shechem in the mountainous region of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, in the mountainous region of Judah. 8 In the region of the Jordan, east of Jericho, they selected Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.\n9 These became the cities appointed for all the Israelites and for the foreign residents residing among them, so that anyone who unintentionally killed someone could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.\nChapter 21\n1 The heads of the paternal houses of the Levites now approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel, 2 and they spoke to them in Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying: \"Jehovah through Moses commanded that we be given cities in which to dwell, along with their pastures for our livestock.\" 3 So at the order of Jehovah, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pastures out of their own inheritance.\n4 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites, and the Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were given by lot 13 cities out of the tribe of Judah, the tribe of Simeon, and the tribe of Benjamin.\n5 And for the rest of the Kohathites, there were allotted ten cities out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, the tribe of Dan, and the half tribe of Manasseh.\n6 And for the Gershonites, there were allotted 13 cities out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, the tribe of Asher, the tribe of Naphtali, and the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.\n7 For the Merarites by their families, there were 12 cities out of the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebulun.\n8 Thus the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pastures by lot, just as Jehovah had commanded through Moses.\n9 So from the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Simeon, they gave these cities here mentioned by name, 10 and they were given to the sons of Aaron of the Kohathite families of the Levites, because they received the first lot. 11 They gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba was the father of Anak), that is, Hebron, in the mountainous region of Judah, and its surrounding pastures. 12 But the field of the city and its settlements they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.\n13 And to the sons of Aaron the priest, they gave the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Hebron with its pastures, also Libnah with its pastures, 14 Jattir with its pastures, Eshtemoa with its pastures, 15 Holon with its pastures, Debir with its pastures, 16 Ain with its pastures, Juttah with its pastures, and Beth-shemesh with its pastures-nine cities out of these two tribes.\n17 And from the tribe of Benjamin: Gibeon with its pastures, Geba with its pastures, 18 Anathoth with its pastures, and Almon with its pastures-four cities.\n19 All the cities given to the descendants of Aaron, the priests, were 13 cities with their pastures.\n20 And the rest of the Kohathite families among the Levites were given by lot cities from the tribe of Ephraim. 21 They gave them the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Shechem with its pastures in the mountainous region of Ephraim, Gezer with its pastures, 22 Kibzaim with its pastures, and Beth-horon with its pastures-four cities.\n23 And from the tribe of Dan: Elteke with its pastures, Gibbethon with its pastures, 24 Aijalon with its pastures, Gath-rimmon with its pastures-four cities.\n25 And from the half tribe of Manasseh: Taanach with its pastures and Gath-rimmon with its pastures-two cities.\n26 All the cities together with their pastures that the rest of the families of the Kohathites received were ten.\n27 And the Gershonites of the families of the Levites received from the half tribe of Manasseh the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Golan, in Bashan, with its pastures and Beeshterah with its pastures-two cities.\n28 And from the tribe of Issachar: Kishion with its pastures, Daberath with its pastures, 29 Jarmuth with its pastures, and En-gannim with its pastures-four cities.\n30 And from the tribe of Asher: Mishal with its pastures, Abdon with its pastures, 31 Helkath with its pastures, and Rehob with its pastures-four cities.\n32 And from the tribe of Naphtali: the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Kedesh in Galilee with its pastures, Hammoth-dor with its pastures, and Kartan with its pastures-three cities.\n33 All the cities of the Gershonites by their families were 13 cities with their pastures.\n34 And the families of the Merarites, the rest of the Levites, received from the tribe of Zebulun: Jokneam with its pastures, Kartah with its pastures, 35 Dimnah with its pastures, and Nahalal with its pastures-four cities.\n36 And from the tribe of Reuben: Bezer with its pastures, Jahaz with its pastures, 37 Kedemoth with its pastures, and Mephaath with its pastures-four cities.\n38 And from the tribe of Gad: the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Ramoth in Gilead with its pastures, Mahanaim with its pastures, 39 Heshbon with its pastures, and Jazer with its pastures-a total of four cities.\n40 All the cities that were allotted to the Merarites by their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, were 12 cities.\n41 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the Israelites were 48 cities together with their pastures. 42 Each of these cities had its pastures all around it-this was the case for all these cities.\n43 So Jehovah gave Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled in it. 44 Furthermore, Jehovah gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their forefathers, and not one of all their enemies could stand against them. Jehovah gave all their enemies into their hand. 45 Not a promise failed out of all the good promises that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel; all of them came true.\nChapter 22\n1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh 2 and said to them: \"You have done all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and you have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you. 3 You have not forsaken your brothers all this time, down to this day; and you have kept the obligation of the commandment of Jehovah your God. 4 Now Jehovah your God has given your brothers rest, just as he promised them. So now you may return to your tents in the land that Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you to possess on the other side of the Jordan. 5 Only be very careful to carry out the commandment and the Law that Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you, by loving Jehovah your God, by walking in all his ways, by keeping his commandments, by sticking to him, and by serving him with all your heart and with all your soul.\"\n6 Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents. 7 And to the half tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given an inheritance in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe, Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan, along with their brothers. Moreover, when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them 8 and said to them: \"Return to your tents with many riches, with very much livestock, with silver and gold, copper and iron, and garments in very great quantity. Take your share of the spoil of your enemies, along with your brothers.\"\n9 After that the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh departed from the other Israelites, from Shiloh in the land of Canaan, and they returned to the land of Gilead, the land of their possession where they had settled at the order of Jehovah through Moses. 10 When they came to the regions of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large, impressive altar. 11 Later the other Israelites heard it said: \"Look! The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the frontier of the land of Canaan in the regions of the Jordan on the side belonging to the Israelites.\" 12 When the Israelites heard about it, the whole assembly of the Israelites congregated at Shiloh to go to war against them.\n13 Then the Israelites sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, 14 and ten chieftains were with him, one chieftain of each paternal house of all the tribes of Israel, each a head of his paternal house among the thousands of Israel. 15 When they came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, they said to them:\n16 \"This is what all the assembly of Jehovah says: 'What is this act of unfaithfulness that you have committed against the God of Israel? You have turned back today from following Jehovah by building yourselves an altar and rebelling against Jehovah. 17 Was the error of Peor not enough for us? We have not cleansed ourselves from it down to this day, even though a plague came upon the assembly of Jehovah. 18 And you would turn back today from following Jehovah! If you rebel today against Jehovah, then tomorrow he will be indignant against the entire assembly of Israel. 19 Now if it is because the land of your possession is unclean, cross over to the land of Jehovah's possession where the tabernacle of Jehovah resides and settle among us, but do not rebel against Jehovah, and do not make us rebels by building yourselves an altar in addition to the altar of Jehovah our God. 20 When Achan the son of Zerah committed an act of unfaithfulness regarding what was devoted to destruction, did not indignation come against all the assembly of Israel? And he was not the only man to die for his error.'\"\n21 At this the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh said in answer to the heads of the thousands of Israel: 22 \"The God of gods, Jehovah! The God of gods, Jehovah! He knows, and Israel will also know. If we were rebellious and unfaithful to Jehovah, do not spare us this day. 23 If we built ourselves an altar to turn back from following Jehovah and to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, and communion sacrifices on it, Jehovah will exact the penalty. 24 No, it was because of another concern that we did this, for we said, 'In the future, your sons will say to our sons: \"What do you have to do with Jehovah the God of Israel? 25 Jehovah has put the Jordan as a boundary between us and you, the Reubenites and the Gadites. You have no share in Jehovah.\" And your sons will hinder our sons from worshipping Jehovah.'\n26 \"So we said, 'Let us by all means take action by building an altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, 27 but to be a witness between you and us and our descendants after us that we will carry out our service to Jehovah before him with our burnt offerings and our sacrifices and our communion sacrifices, so that your sons may not say to our sons in the future: \"You have no share in Jehovah.\"' 28 So we said, 'If they should say that to us and to our descendants in the future, we will then say: \"See the replica of Jehovah's altar that our forefathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but to be a witness between you and us.\"' 29 It is unthinkable for us to rebel against Jehovah and to turn back today from following Jehovah by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrifices, other than the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle!\"\n30 When Phinehas the priest, the chieftains of the assembly, and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him heard the words that the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh spoke, they were satisfied. 31 So Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh: \"Today we know that Jehovah is among us, because you have not committed this act of unfaithfulness against Jehovah. Now you have saved the Israelites out of the hand of Jehovah.\"\n32 Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the chieftains returned from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, and they brought back word to the other Israelites. 33 And the Israelites were satisfied with the report. The Israelites then praised God, and they said nothing more about going to war against the Reubenites and the Gadites to destroy the land in which they were dwelling.\n34 So the Reubenites and the Gadites named the altar, because \"it is a witness between us that Jehovah is the true God.\"\nChapter 23\n1 Many days after Jehovah had given Israel rest from all its surrounding enemies, when Joshua was old and advanced in years, 2 Joshua summoned all Israel, its elders, its heads, its judges, and its officers, and he said to them: \"I have grown old; I am advanced in years. 3 And you have seen for yourselves all that Jehovah your God did to all these nations in your behalf because Jehovah your God was the one who was fighting for you. 4 See, I assigned to you by lot the land of the nations that remain as an inheritance for your tribes, as well as that of all the nations that I destroyed, from the Jordan to the Great Sea on the west. 5 And Jehovah your God was the one who kept thrusting them away from before you, and he drove them out for you, and you took possession of their land, just as Jehovah your God promised you.\n6 \"Now you must be very courageous to observe and carry out all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses by never deviating from it to the right or to the left, 7 by never mingling with these nations that remain with you. You must not even mention the names of their gods nor swear by them, and you must never serve them nor bow down to them. 8 But you must stick to Jehovah your God, just as you have done down to this day. 9 Jehovah will drive away great and mighty nations from before you, for not a man has been able to stand before you to this day. 10 Just one man of you will chase a thousand, because Jehovah your God is fighting for you, just as he promised you. 11 So be on guard constantly by loving Jehovah your God.\n12 \"But if you should turn back at all and stick to what is left of these nations that remain with you and you form marriage alliances with them and associate with them and they with you, 13 you should know for sure that Jehovah your God will not continue to drive out these nations for you. They will become a trap and a snare and a scourge on your flanks and thorns in your eyes until you have perished from this good land that Jehovah your God has given you.\n14 \"Now look! I am about to die, and you well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed. 15 But just as all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you have come upon you, so Jehovah will bring upon you all the calamity that he promised and will annihilate you from this good land that Jehovah your God has given you. 16 If you violate the covenant of Jehovah your God that he commanded you to keep and if you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then Jehovah's anger will blaze against you and you will quickly perish from the good land that he has given you.\"\nChapter 24\n1 Joshua then assembled all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem and summoned the elders of Israel, its heads, its judges, and its officers, and they stood before the true God. 2 Joshua said to all the people: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'It was on the other side of the River that your forefathers lived a long time ago-Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor-and they used to serve other gods.\n3 \"'In time I took your forefather Abraham from the other side of the River and had him walk through all the land of Canaan and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac; 4 then to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. Later to Esau I gave Mount Seir as his possession; and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 5 I later sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did among them, and then I brought you out. 6 When I was bringing your fathers out of Egypt and you came to the sea, the Egyptians were chasing after your fathers with war chariots and cavalrymen as far as the Red Sea. 7 They began to cry out to Jehovah, so he placed a darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea over them and covered them, and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you dwelled in the wilderness many years.\n8 \"'And I brought you to the land of the Amorites who were dwelling on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought against you. But I gave them into your hand so that you could take possession of their land, and I annihilated them from before you. 9 Then Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, rose up and fought against Israel. So he summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. 10 But I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed you repeatedly, and I rescued you from his hand.\n11 \"'Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the leaders of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites fought against you, but I gave them into your hand. 12 So I sent the feeling of dejection ahead of you, and it drove them out from before you-two kings of the Amorites. It was not by your sword and not by your bow. 13 Thus I gave you a land for which you had not toiled and cities that you had not built, and you settled in them. You are eating from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.'\n14 \"Therefore, fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness, and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah. 15 Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.\"\n16 At this the people answered: \"It is unthinkable for us to abandon Jehovah and to serve other gods. 17 It is Jehovah our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who performed these great signs before our eyes and who kept guarding us the entire way in which we walked and among all the peoples through whom we passed. 18 Jehovah drove out all the peoples, including the Amorites, who lived in the land before us. Therefore, we too will serve Jehovah, because he is our God.\"\n19 Then Joshua said to the people: \"You are not able to serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God; he is a God who requires exclusive devotion. He will not pardon your transgressions and your sins. 20 If you abandon Jehovah and serve foreign gods, he will also turn against you and exterminate you after doing good for you.\"\n21 But the people said to Joshua: \"No, but we will serve Jehovah!\" 22 So Joshua said to the people: \"You are witnesses against yourselves that of your own accord, you have chosen for yourselves to serve Jehovah.\" To this they said: \"We are witnesses.\"\n23 \"Therefore, remove the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to Jehovah the God of Israel.\" 24 The people said to Joshua: \"We will serve Jehovah our God, and we will obey his voice!\"\n25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day and established a regulation and a ruling for them in Shechem. 26 Then Joshua wrote these words in the book of God's Law and took a great stone and set it up under the large tree that is by the sanctuary of Jehovah.\n27 Joshua went on to say to all the people: \"Look! This stone will serve as a witness against us, because it has heard everything Jehovah said to us, and it will serve as a witness against you, so that you may not deny your God.\" 28 With that Joshua sent the people away, each one to his inheritance.\n29 After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of 110. 30 So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the mountainous region of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 31 Israel continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had known all of Jehovah's deeds in behalf of Israel.\n32 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in the portion of the field that Jacob had acquired from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for 100 pieces of money; and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.\n33 Also, Eleazar the son of Aaron died. So they buried him in the Hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the mountainous region of Ephraim.\n",

    "text": "Judges\nChapter 1\n1 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of Jehovah: \"Who of us will go up first to fight against the Canaanites?\" 2 Jehovah replied: \"Judah will go up. Look! I am giving the land into his hand.\" 3 Then Judah said to his brother Simeon: \"Come up with me into my assigned territory to fight against the Canaanites. Then I will go with you into your assigned territory.\" So Simeon went with him.\n4 When Judah went up, Jehovah gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they defeated 10,000 men in Bezek. 5 They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and there they fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 6 When Adoni-bezek fled, they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 7 Then Adoni-bezek said: \"There are 70 kings whose thumbs and big toes were cut off and who are picking up food under my table. Just as I have done, so God has repaid me.\" After that they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.\n8 Furthermore, the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it; they struck it with the sword and set the city on fire. 9 Afterward, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites inhabiting the mountainous region and the Negeb and the Shephelah. 10 So Judah marched against the Canaanites who were dwelling in Hebron (the name of Hebron was previously Kiriath-arba), and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.\n11 They marched from there against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was previously Kiriath-sepher.) 12 Then Caleb said: \"To the man who strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife.\" 13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 14 While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey. Caleb asked her: \"What do you want?\" 15 She said to him: \"Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south; give me also Gulloth-maim.\" So Caleb gave her Upper Gulloth and Lower Gulloth.\n16 And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, came up from the city of palm trees with the people of Judah to the wilderness of Judah south of Arad. They went there and settled among the people. 17 But Judah marched on with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites inhabiting Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So they named the city Hormah. 18 Then Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory. 19 Jehovah was with Judah, and they took possession of the mountainous region, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had war chariots with iron scythes. 20 They gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised, and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak.\n21 But the Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusites inhabiting Jerusalem, so the Jebusites continue dwelling with the Benjaminites in Jerusalem down to this day.\n22 Meantime, the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them. 23 The house of Joseph was spying on Bethel (incidentally, the name of the city was previously Luz), 24 and the spies saw a man going out of the city. So they said to him: \"Show us, please, the way into the city, and we will treat you kindly.\" 25 So the man showed them the way into the city, and they struck the city with the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free. 26 The man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz, which is its name to this day.\n27 Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its dependent towns, Taanach and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent towns. The Canaanites persisted in dwelling in this land. 28 When Israel grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.\n29 Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were dwelling in Gezer. The Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer.\n30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and the inhabitants of Nahalol. The Canaanites continued to dwell among them and were subjected to forced labor.\n31 Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco and the inhabitants of Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob. 32 So the Asherites continued to dwell among the Canaanites inhabiting the land, because they did not drive them out.\n33 Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but they continued to dwell among the Canaanites inhabiting the land. The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced laborers for them.\n34 The Amorites confined the Danites to the mountainous region, for they would not let them come down into the plain. 35 So the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they were forced into hard labor. 36 The territory of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela upward.\nChapter 2\n1 Then Jehovah's angel went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said: \"I brought you up out of Egypt into the land about which I swore to your forefathers. Furthermore, I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you. 2 For your part, you must not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land and you should pull down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my voice. Why have you done this? 3 That is why I also said, 'I will not drive them away from before you, and they will ensnare you, and their gods will lure you away.'\"\n4 When Jehovah's angel spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people began to weep loudly. 5 So they named that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.\n6 When Joshua sent the people away, each of the Israelites went to his inheritance to take possession of the land. 7 The people continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had seen all of Jehovah's great deeds in behalf of Israel. 8 Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died at the age of 110. 9 So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mountainous region of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 10 All that generation were gathered to their ancestors, and another generation arose after them that did not know Jehovah or what he had done for Israel.\n11 So the Israelites did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and served the Baals. 12 Thus they abandoned Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt. And they followed other gods, the gods of the peoples who were all around them, and they bowed down to them and offended Jehovah. 13 They abandoned Jehovah and served Baal and the Ashtoreth images. 14 At this Jehovah's anger blazed against Israel, so he handed them over to plunderers who pillaged them. He sold them into the hand of the enemies around them, and they were no longer able to hold their own against their enemies. 15 Wherever they went, the hand of Jehovah was against them, bringing disaster on them, just as Jehovah had said and just as Jehovah had sworn to them, and they were in great distress. 16 So Jehovah would raise up judges who would save them from the hand of their plunderers.\n17 But they refused to listen even to the judges and would prostitute themselves to other gods and bow down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their forefathers had walked, those who had obeyed the commandments of Jehovah. They failed to do that. 18 Whenever Jehovah did raise up judges for them, Jehovah would be with the judge and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity over their groaning caused by those who oppressed them and those who were treating them abusively.\n19 But when the judge died, they would again act more corruptly than their fathers by following other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not abandon their practices and their stubborn behavior. 20 Finally Jehovah's anger blazed against Israel, and he said: \"Because this nation has violated my covenant that I commanded their forefathers and they have disobeyed me, 21 I for my part will not drive out from before them even one of the nations that Joshua left behind when he died. 22 This is to test whether Israel will keep Jehovah's way by walking in it as their fathers did.\" 23 So Jehovah allowed these nations to remain. He did not drive them out quickly, and he did not give them into Joshua's hand.\nChapter 3\n1 These are the nations that Jehovah allowed to remain so that they could test all those of Israel who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan 2 (this was so that succeeding generations of Israelites would experience war, those who had not experienced such things before): 3 the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites inhabiting Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. 4 They served as a means of testing Israel to determine whether Israel would obey Jehovah's commandments that he had given their fathers through Moses. 5 So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 6 They would take their daughters as wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they began serving their gods.\n7 So the Israelites did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, and they forgot Jehovah their God and were serving the Baals and the sacred poles. 8 At this Jehovah's anger blazed against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim the king of Mesopotamia. The Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years. 9 When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help, Jehovah raised up a savior to rescue the Israelites, Othniel the son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb. 10 The spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he became the judge of Israel. When he went out to battle, Jehovah gave Cushan-rishathaim the king of Mesopotamia into his hand so that he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. 11 After that the land had rest for 40 years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n12 And once again the Israelites began doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. So Jehovah let Eglon the king of Moab prevail over Israel, because they did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. 13 Furthermore, he brought against them the Ammonites and the Amalekites. They attacked Israel and captured the city of palm trees. 14 The Israelites served Eglon the king of Moab for 18 years. 15 Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help, so Jehovah raised up for them a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjaminite who was left-handed. In time the Israelites sent tribute through him to Eglon the king of Moab. 16 Meanwhile, Ehud made for himself a two-edged sword, a cubit long, and he strapped it underneath his garment on his right thigh. 17 He then presented the tribute to Eglon the king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.\n18 When Ehud finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. 19 But after reaching the carved images at Gilgal, he himself went back and said: \"I have a secret message for you, O king.\" So the king said: \"Silence!\" With that all his attendants left him. 20 So Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. Then Ehud said: \"I have a message from God for you.\" So he rose up from his throne. 21 Then Ehud drew the sword from his right thigh with his left hand and plunged it into his belly. 22 The handle went in after the blade, and the fat closed in over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and the fecal matter came out. 23 Ehud went out through the porch, closing the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locking them. 24 After he left, the servants returned and saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked. So they said: \"He must be relieving himself in the cool interior room.\" 25 They kept waiting until they were embarrassed, but when they saw that he was still not opening the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them and saw their lord fallen to the floor dead!\n26 Ehud escaped while they were lingering, and he passed by the carved images and made it safely to Seirah. 27 When he arrived, he sounded the horn in the mountainous region of Ephraim; and the Israelites went down out of the mountainous region, with him at their head. 28 Then he said to them: \"Follow me, because Jehovah has given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand.\" So they followed him and captured the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and they did not allow anyone to cross. 29 At that time they struck down about 10,000 Moabites, all strong and valiant men; not a single one escaped. 30 So Moab was subdued on that day under Israel's hand; and the land had rest for 80 years.\n31 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down 600 Philistine men with a cattle goad; he too saved Israel.\nChapter 4\n1 But after Ehud died, the Israelites again did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. 2 So Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The chief of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the nations. 3 The Israelites cried out to Jehovah, because Jabin had 900 war chariots with iron scythes, and he harshly oppressed the Israelites for 20 years.\n4 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 5 She used to sit under Deborah's palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the mountainous region of Ephraim; the Israelites would go up to her for judgment. 6 She sent for Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali and said to him: \"Has not Jehovah the God of Israel given the command? 'Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take 10,000 men of Naphtali and Zebulun with you. 7 I will bring to you Sisera, the chief of Jabin's army, along with his war chariots and his troops to the stream of Kishon, and I will give him into your hand.'\"\n8 At this Barak said to her: \"If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I will not go.\" 9 To this she said: \"I will certainly go with you. However, the campaign you are going on will not bring you glory, for it will be into the hand of a woman that Jehovah will give Sisera.\" Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh. 10 Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and 10,000 men followed his steps. Deborah also went up with him.\n11 Incidentally, Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law, and his tent was pitched near the big tree in Zaanannim, which is at Kedesh.\n12 They reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 13 At once Sisera assembled all his war chariots-900 chariots with iron scythes-and all the troops that were with him from Harosheth of the nations to go to the stream of Kishon. 14 Deborah now said to Barak: \"Rise up, for this is the day that Jehovah will give Sisera into your hand. Is Jehovah not going out before you?\" And Barak descended from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him. 15 Then Jehovah threw Sisera and all his war chariots and all the army into confusion before the sword of Barak. Finally Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot. 16 Barak chased after the war chariots and the army as far as Harosheth of the nations. So Sisera's whole army fell by the sword; not even one remained.\n17 But Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 18 Then Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him: \"Come in, my lord, come in here. Do not be afraid.\" So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket. 19 Then he said to her: \"Give me, please, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.\" So she opened a skin bottle of milk and gave him a drink, after which she again covered him. 20 He told her: \"Stand at the entrance of the tent, and if anybody comes and asks you, 'Is there a man here?' say, 'No!'\"\n21 But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent pin and a hammer in her hand. Then while he was fast asleep and exhausted, she stealthily approached him and drove the pin through his temples and beat it into the ground, and he died.\n22 Barak went there in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael now came out to meet him and said: \"Come and I will show you the man you are looking for.\" He went in with her and saw Sisera lying dead, with the tent pin through his temples.\n23 So on that day, God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the Israelites. 24 The hand of the Israelites came down harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin the king of Canaan.\nChapter 5\n1 On that day Deborah along with Barak the son of Abinoam sang this song:\n2 \"Because of the unbound hair in Israel,\nBecause of the people's volunteering,\nPraise Jehovah!\n3 Listen, you kings! Give ear, you rulers!\nTo Jehovah I will sing.\nI will sing praises to Jehovah, Israel's God.\n4 Jehovah, when you went out from Seir,\nWhen you marched out of the territory of Edom,\nThe earth shook, and the heavens poured,\nThe clouds poured down water.\n5 Mountains melted before the face of Jehovah,\nEven Sinai before the face of Jehovah, Israel's God.\n6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,\nIn the days of Jael, the roads were deserted;\nTravelers kept to the back roads.\n7 The villagers in Israel were no more;\nThey were no more until I, Deborah, rose up,\nUntil I arose as a mother in Israel.\n8 They chose new gods;\nThen there was war in the gates.\nA shield could not be seen, nor a lance,\nAmong 40,000 in Israel.\n9 My heart is with the commanders of Israel,\nWho went as volunteers with the people.\nPraise Jehovah!\n10 You riders on tawny donkeys,\nYou who sit on fine carpets,\nAnd you who walk on the road,\nConsider!\n11 The voices of the water distributors were heard at the watering places;\nThere they were recounting the righteous acts of Jehovah,\nThe righteous acts of his villagers in Israel.\nThen Jehovah's people went down to the gates.\n12 Awake, awake, O Deborah!\nAwake, awake, sing a song!\nRise up, Barak! Lead your captives away, you son of Abinoam!\n13 Then those who were left came down to the nobles;\nJehovah's people came down to me against the mighty.\n14 Out of Ephraim was their origin, those in the valley;\nThey are following you, O Benjamin, among your peoples.\nFrom Machir the commanders went down,\nAnd from Zebulun those who bear the recruiter's staff.\n15 The princes in Issachar were with Deborah,\nAs was Issachar, so was Barak.\nInto the valley plain he was sent on foot.\nAmong the divisions of Reuben there was intense heart-searching.\n16 Why did you sit down between the two saddlebags,\nListening to them playing their pipes for the flocks?\nFor the divisions of Reuben, there was intense heart-searching.\n17 Gilead remained beyond the Jordan;\nAnd Dan, why did he stay with the ships?\nAsher sat idle at the seashore,\nAnd by his harbors he remained.\n18 Zebulun was a people who risked their lives to the point of death;\nNaphtali also, on the open heights.\n19 Kings came, they fought;\nThe kings of Canaan then fought\nIn Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo.\nNo spoil of silver did they take.\n20 From heaven the stars fought;\nFrom their orbits they fought against Sisera.\n21 The torrent of Kishon washed them away,\nThe ancient torrent, the torrent of Kishon.\nYou trampled down the powerful, O my soul.\n22 Then the hooves of horses pounded\nAs his stallions galloped furiously.\n23 'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of Jehovah,\n'Yes, curse its inhabitants,\nFor they did not come to the assistance of Jehovah,\nTo the assistance of Jehovah with the mighty ones.'\n24 Most blessed of women is Jael\nThe wife of Heber the Kenite;\nShe is most blessed of women living in tents.\n25 He asked for water; she gave him milk.\nIn a majestic banquet bowl she offered curdled milk.\n26 With her hand she reached for the tent pin,\nHer right hand for the workman's mallet.\nAnd she hammered Sisera, she crushed his head,\nAnd she smashed and pierced his temples.\n27 Between her feet he collapsed; he fell and lay still;\nBetween her feet he collapsed and fell;\nWhere he collapsed, there he fell defeated.\n28 From the window a woman looked out,\nSisera's mother peered out from the lattice,\n'Why is his chariot delayed in coming?\nWhy are the hoofbeats of his chariots so late?'\n29 The wisest of her noble ladies would answer her;\nYes, she too would repeat to herself,\n30 'They must be dividing the spoil they found,\nA girl, two girls, to every warrior,\nSpoil of dyed cloth for Sisera, spoil of dyed cloth,\nAn embroidered garment, dyed cloth, two embroidered garments\nFor the necks of the plunderers.'\n31 So let all your enemies perish, O Jehovah,\nBut let those who love you be like the sun rising in its glory.\"\nAnd the land had rest for 40 years.\nChapter 6\n1 But the Israelites again did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, so Jehovah gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years. 2 The hand of Midian dominated over Israel. Because of Midian, the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, in the caves, and in the places difficult to approach. 3 If Israel sowed seed, Midian and Amalek and the Easterners would attack them. 4 They would camp against them and ruin the produce of the land all the way to Gaza, and they left nothing for Israel to eat and no sheep or bull or donkey. 5 For they would come up with their livestock and tents as numerous as the locusts, and they and their camels could not be numbered, and they would come into the land to destroy it. 6 So Israel became greatly impoverished on account of Midian; and the Israelites called to Jehovah for help.\n7 When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help because of Midian, 8 Jehovah sent to the Israelites a prophet who said to them: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'I brought you up from Egypt and thus brought you out of the house of slavery. 9 So I rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from all your oppressors and drove them out from before you and gave you their land. 10 And I said to you: \"I am Jehovah your God. You must not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling.\" But you did not obey me.'\"\n11 Later Jehovah's angel came and sat under the big tree that was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abi-ezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from Midian. 12 Jehovah's angel appeared to him and said: \"Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.\" 13 At this Gideon said to him: \"Pardon me, my lord, but if Jehovah is with us, why has all of this come upon us? Where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us, saying, 'Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?' Now Jehovah has deserted us and given us into Midian's hand.\" 14 Jehovah faced him and said: \"Go with the strength you have, and you will save Israel out of Midian's hand. Is it not I who send you?\" 15 Gideon answered him: \"Pardon me, Jehovah. How can I save Israel? Look! My clan is the least in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.\" 16 But Jehovah said to him: \"Because I will be with you, you will strike down Midian as if they were one man.\"\n17 Then he said to him: \"If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, show me a sign that you are the one speaking with me. 18 Please do not depart from here until I return with my gift and set it before you.\" So he said: \"I will stay here until you return.\" 19 And Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and made unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in the basket and the broth in the cooking pot; then he brought them out to him and served them under the big tree.\n20 The angel of the true God now said to him: \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on the big rock there, and pour out the broth.\" And he did so. 21 Then Jehovah's angel stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread, and fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Jehovah's angel then vanished from his sight. 22 Gideon now realized that it was Jehovah's angel.\nAt once Gideon said: \"Alas, Sovereign Lord Jehovah, for I have seen Jehovah's angel face-to-face!\" 23 But Jehovah said to him: \"Peace be with you. Have no fear; you will not die.\" 24 So Gideon built an altar there to Jehovah, and it is called Jehovah-shalom down to this day. It is still in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.\n25 That night Jehovah said to him: \"Take the young bull that belongs to your father, the second young bull that is seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the sacred pole next to it. 26 After you build an altar to Jehovah your God on top of this stronghold with the row of stones, take the second young bull and offer it as a burnt offering on the pieces of wood from the sacred pole that you cut down.\" 27 So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did just as Jehovah told him. But he feared the household of his father and the men of the city too much to do it by day, so he did it at night.\n28 When the men of the city got up early the next morning, they saw that the altar of Baal had been pulled down and the sacred pole beside it had been cut down and the second young bull had been offered up on the altar that had been built. 29 They asked one another: \"Who did this?\" After they investigated, they said: \"Gideon the son of Joash did this.\" 30 So the men of the city said to Joash: \"Bring your son out that he may die, because he pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred pole next to it.\" 31 Joash then said to all those who confronted him: \"Do you have to defend Baal? Do you have to save him? Whoever defends him should be put to death this morning. If he is a god, let him defend himself, since someone pulled down his altar.\" 32 And he called Gideon Jerubbaal on that day, saying: \"Let Baal defend himself, for someone has pulled down his altar.\"\n33 All Midian and Amalek and the Easterners joined forces; and they crossed over into the Valley of Jezreel and camped. 34 Then Jehovah's spirit came upon Gideon and he sounded the horn, and the Abi-ezrites rallied behind him. 35 He sent out messengers through all of Manasseh, and they too rallied behind him. He also sent out messengers through Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet him.\n36 Then Gideon said to the true God: \"If you are saving Israel by means of me, just as you have promised, 37 here I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only but all the ground around it is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by means of me, just as you have promised.\" 38 And that is how it happened. When he rose up early the next day and wrung the fleece, he squeezed off enough dew from the fleece to fill a large banquet bowl with water. 39 However, Gideon said to the true God: \"Do not let your anger burn against me, but let me ask just once more. Let me, please, make just one more test with the fleece. Please let the fleece alone be dry while there is dew all over the ground.\" 40 So that is what God did that night; only the fleece was dry, and there was dew all over the ground.\nChapter 7\n1 Then Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, and all the people with him rose early and encamped at the Spring of Harod, while the camp of Midian was north of him at the hill of Moreh in the valley plain. 2 Jehovah now said to Gideon: \"There are too many people with you for me to give Midian into their hand. Otherwise, Israel might brag about itself against me and say, 'My own hand saved me.' 3 Now, please, announce in the presence of the people: 'Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return home.'\" So Gideon put them to the test. With that, 22,000 of the people returned home, and 10,000 remained.\n4 Still Jehovah said to Gideon: \"There are yet too many people. Have them go down to the water so that I may test them for you there. When I say to you, 'This one will go with you,' he will go with you, but when I say to you, 'This one will not go along with you,' he will not go along.\" 5 So he took the people down to the water.\nThen Jehovah said to Gideon: \"Separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue just as a dog laps, from those who bend down on their knees to drink.\" 6 The number of those lapping up the water, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men. The rest of the people bent down on their knees to drink.\n7 Jehovah now said to Gideon: \"I will save you with the 300 men who lapped the water, and I will give Midian into your hand. But let all the other people go back home.\" 8 So after they took the provisions and the horns from the people, he sent all the other men of Israel back home, and he kept only the 300 men. The camp of Midian was below him in the valley plain.\n9 During that night, Jehovah said to him: \"Get up, attack the camp, for I have given it into your hand. 10 But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with Purah your attendant. 11 Listen to what they say, and afterward you will have the courage to attack the camp.\" At that he and Purah his attendant went down to the edge of the encamped army.\n12 Now Midian and Amalek and all the Easterners covered the valley plain like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were without number, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. 13 Gideon now came, and there was a man relating a dream to his companion, and he said: \"This is the dream I had. There was a round loaf of barley bread rolling into the camp of Midian. It came to a tent and struck it so hard that it collapsed. Yes, it turned the tent upside down, and the tent fell flat.\" 14 At this his companion said: \"This can only be the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.\"\n15 As soon as Gideon heard him relate the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down to worship. After that he returned to the camp of Israel and said: \"Get up, for Jehovah has given the camp of Midian into your hand.\" 16 Then he divided the 300 men into three bands and gave all of them horns and large empty jars with torches inside the jars. 17 Then he said to them: \"Watch me and do exactly what I do. When I come to the edge of the camp, you should do just as I do. 18 When I blow the horn, I and all who are with me, you also must blow the horns all around the camp and shout, 'For Jehovah and for Gideon!'\"\n19 Gideon and the 100 men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the start of the middle night watch, just after the sentries were posted. They blew the horns and smashed the large water jars that were in their hands. 20 So the three bands blew the horns and shattered the large jars. They held the torches in their left hands and blew the horns in their right hands and they called out: \"The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!\" 21 All the while each man stood in his place all around the camp, and the whole army ran away, shouting as they fled. 22 The 300 continued to blow the horns, and Jehovah turned the sword of each one against the other throughout the camp; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah, on to Zererah, as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.\n23 And the men of Israel were called together from Naphtali, Asher, and all of Manasseh, and they chased after Midian. 24 Gideon sent messengers into all the mountainous region of Ephraim, saying: \"Go down to attack Midian, and capture the access to the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.\" So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. 25 They also captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb on the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They kept on pursuing Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon in the region of the Jordan.\nChapter 8\n1 Then the men of Ephraim said to him: \"What have you done to us? Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian?\" And they quarreled bitterly with him. 2 But he said to them: \"What have I done compared with you? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abi-ezer? 3 It was into your hand that God gave Midian's princes Oreb and Zeeb, and what have I done compared with you?\" When he spoke this way, they calmed down.\n4 Gideon then came to the Jordan and crossed it. He and the 300 men with him were tired, but they kept up the pursuit. 5 So he said to the men of Succoth: \"Please give loaves of bread to the people following me, for they are tired and I am chasing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\" 6 But the princes of Succoth said: \"Are the palms of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your army?\" 7 At this Gideon said: \"Just for that, when Jehovah gives Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will give you a thrashing with the thorns and the briars of the wilderness.\" 8 And he went up from there to Penuel and made the same request, but the men of Penuel gave him the same answer as the men of Succoth. 9 So he said also to the men of Penuel: \"When I return in peace, I will pull down this tower.\"\n10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies, about 15,000 men. These were all who remained of the entire army of the Easterners, for 120,000 men armed with swords had fallen. 11 Gideon continued up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the camp, which was off guard. 12 When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued and captured the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, throwing the whole camp into a panic.\n13 Gideon the son of Joash then returned from the war by way of the pass that goes up to Heres. 14 En route he captured and interrogated a young man from Succoth. So the young man wrote out for him the names of the princes and elders of Succoth, 77 men. 15 With that he went to the men of Succoth and said: \"Here are Zebah and Zalmunna about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the palms of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand so that we should give bread to your exhausted men?'\" 16 Then he took the elders of the city and with thorns and briars of the wilderness, he taught the men of Succoth a lesson. 17 And he pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.\n18 He asked Zebah and Zalmunna: \"What sort of men did you kill in Tabor?\" To this they said: \"They were like you, each one looked like the son of a king.\" 19 At that he said: \"They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As surely as Jehovah lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not have to kill you.\" 20 Then he said to Jether his firstborn: \"Get up, kill them.\" But the young man did not draw his sword; he was afraid, for he was still a young man. 21 So Zebah and Zalmunna said: \"Get up yourself and slay us, for a man is judged by his mightiness.\" So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the crescent-shaped ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.\n22 Later the men of Israel said to Gideon: \"Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson as well, for you saved us out of the hand of Midian.\" 23 But Gideon said to them: \"I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. Jehovah is the one who will rule over you.\" 24 Gideon continued: \"Let me make one request of you: that each of you give me a nose ring from his spoil.\" (For they had gold nose rings because they were Ishmaelites.) 25 They replied: \"We will surely give them.\" With that they spread out a robe and each man threw a nose ring from his spoil on it. 26 The weight of the gold nose rings that he had requested amounted to 1,700 gold shekels, besides the crescent-shaped ornaments, the pendants, the purple wool garments worn by the kings of Midian, and the necklaces from the camels.\n27 Gideon made it into an ephod and exhibited it in his city Ophrah; and all Israel committed spiritual prostitution with it there, and it served as a snare to Gideon and to his household.\n28 Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites, and they did not challenge them again; and the land had rest for 40 years in the days of Gideon.\n29 So Jerubbaal the son of Joash returned to his home and stayed there.\n30 Gideon became father to 70 sons, for he had many wives. 31 His concubine in Shechem also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. 32 And Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.\n33 As soon as Gideon died, the Israelites again committed spiritual prostitution with the Baals, and they appointed Baal-berith as their god. 34 The Israelites did not remember Jehovah their God, who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies around them; 35 nor did they show loyal love toward the household of Jerubbaal, that is Gideon, in return for all the good that he had done for Israel.\nChapter 9\n1 In time Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to his mother's brothers in Shechem, and he said to them and to all the family of his grandfather: 2 \"Please ask all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you, for all 70 sons of Jerubbaal to rule over you or for one man to rule over you? And remember that I am your own bone and flesh.'\"\n3 So his mother's brothers said this in his behalf to all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said: \"He is our own brother.\" 4 Then they gave him 70 pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith, and Abimelech used it to hire idle and insolent men to accompany him. 5 After that he went to his father's house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, 70 men, on one stone. The only survivor was Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, because he hid.\n6 Then all the leaders of Shechem and all Beth-millo gathered together and made Abimelech king, close by the big tree, by the pillar that was in Shechem.\n7 When they reported it to Jotham, he at once went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and called out in a loud voice to them: \"Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, and then God will listen to you.\n8 \"Once there were trees that went to anoint a king over them. So they said to the olive tree, 'Rule over us.' 9 But the olive tree said to them, 'Must I give up my oil, which they use to glorify God and men, to go and wave over the other trees?' 10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come and rule over us.' 11 But the fig tree said to them, 'Must I give up my sweetness and my good fruitage to go and wave over the other trees?' 12 Next the trees said to the vine, 'Come and rule over us.' 13 The vine replied to them, 'Must I give up my new wine that makes God and men rejoice to go and wave over the trees?' 14 Finally all the other trees said to the bramble, 'Come and rule over us.' 15 At this the bramble said to the trees, 'If you are really anointing me as king over you, come and seek refuge under my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'\n16 \"Now have you acted sincerely and honorably in making Abimelech king, and have you shown goodness toward Jerubbaal and his household, and have you treated him as he deserves? 17 When my father fought for you, he risked his life to save you from Midian's hand. 18 But today you have risen up against my father's household and killed his sons, 70 men, on one stone. Then you made Abimelech, the son of his slave girl, king over the leaders of Shechem just because he is your brother. 19 Yes, if you are acting sincerely and honorably toward Jerubbaal and his household this day, rejoice over Abimelech and let him also rejoice over you. 20 But if not, may fire come out of Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come out of the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech.\"\n21 Then Jotham fled and escaped to Beer, and he lived there because of his brother Abimelech.\n22 Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years. 23 Then God let hostility develop between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and they dealt treacherously with Abimelech. 24 This was so that the violence done to the 70 sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged, so as to place responsibility for their blood on their brother Abimelech for killing them and on the leaders of Shechem for helping him to kill his brothers. 25 So the leaders of Shechem set men to ambush him on the mountaintops, and they would rob everyone who passed by them on the road. In time it was reported to Abimelech.\n26 Then Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers crossed over into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their trust in him. 27 They went out into the field and gathered the grapes of their vineyards, trod them out, and held a festival, after which they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech. 28 Then Gaal the son of Ebed said: \"Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his commissioner? Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem's father! But why should we serve him? 29 If only this people were under my command, I would depose Abimelech.\" Then he said to Abimelech: \"Increase your army and come out.\"\n30 When Zebul the prince of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger blazed. 31 So he secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying: \"Look! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers are now in Shechem, and here they are inciting the city against you. 32 Now come up by night, you and your men, and lie in wait in the field. 33 As soon as the sun rises in the morning, you should get up early and attack the city; and when he and his men come out against you, do whatever you can to defeat him.\"\n34 So Abimelech and all the people with him rose up by night, and in four bands they lay in wait against Shechem. 35 When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, Abimelech and the people with him rose up from the ambush. 36 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: \"Look! There are people coming down from the mountaintops.\" But Zebul said to him: \"You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.\"\n37 Gaal later said: \"Look! People are coming down from the center of the land, and one band is coming by the way of the big tree of Meonenim.\" 38 Zebul replied to him: \"Where now is your boast, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Are these not the people you rejected? Go out now and fight against them.\"\n39 So Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought against Abimelech. 40 Abimelech pursued him, and Gaal fled from him, and many fell slain as far as the entrance of the city gate.\n41 And Abimelech continued to dwell in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem. 42 The next day the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told about it. 43 So he took the people and divided them into three bands and lay in wait in the field. When he saw the people going out of the city, he attacked them and struck them down. 44 Abimelech and the bands with him charged forward and took a position at the entrance of the city gate, while two bands attacked all who were in the field, and they struck them down. 45 Abimelech fought against the city all that day and captured it. He killed the people in it, and then he pulled the city down and sowed it with salt.\n46 When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard about this, they immediately went to the vault of the house of El-berith. 47 As soon as it was reported to Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem had gathered together, 48 Abimelech and all the men with him went up Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut off a tree branch and lifted it on his shoulder and said to the people with him: \"What you saw me do, hurry and do the same!\" 49 So all the people also cut off branches and followed Abimelech. Then they put the branches against the vault and set the vault on fire. So all the people of the tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.\n50 Abimelech then went to Thebez; he camped against Thebez and captured it. 51 There was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women and all the city leaders fled there. They shut themselves in and climbed onto the roof of the tower. 52 Abimelech made his way to the tower and attacked it. He approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire. 53 Then one of the women dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull. 54 He quickly called the attendant bearing his weapons and said to him: \"Draw your sword and put me to death, so that they may not say about me, 'A woman killed him.'\" So his attendant ran him through, and he died.\n55 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went back home. 56 Thus God repaid Abimelech for the evil that he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers. 57 God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem come back on their own heads. So the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.\nChapter 10\n1 After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, rose up to save Israel. He lived in Shamir in the mountainous region of Ephraim. 2 He judged Israel for 23 years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.\n3 After him Jair the Gileadite rose up and judged Israel for 22 years. 4 He had 30 sons who rode on 30 donkeys, and they had 30 cities, which to this day are called Havvoth-jair; they are in the land of Gilead. 5 After that Jair died and was buried in Kamon.\n6 Again the Israelites did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and they began to serve the Baals, the Ashtoreth images, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned Jehovah and did not serve him. 7 Then Jehovah's anger blazed against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites. 8 So they crushed and greatly oppressed the Israelites in that year-for 18 years they oppressed all the Israelites on the side of the Jordan that had been the land of the Amorites in Gilead. 9 The Ammonites would also cross the Jordan to fight against Judah and Benjamin and the house of Ephraim; and Israel was greatly distressed. 10 Then the Israelites called to Jehovah for help, saying: \"We have sinned against you, for we abandoned our God and served the Baals.\"\n11 But Jehovah said to the Israelites: \"Did I not save you from Egypt and from the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines, 12 the Sidonians, Amalek, and Midian when they oppressed you? When you cried out to me, I saved you out of their hand. 13 But you abandoned me and served other gods. That is why I will not save you again. 14 Go to the gods whom you have chosen and call for help. Let them save you in your time of distress.\" 15 But the Israelites said to Jehovah: \"We have sinned. Do to us whatever is good in your eyes. Only save us, please, this day.\" 16 And they removed the foreign gods from their midst and served Jehovah, so that he could no longer tolerate Israel's suffering.\n17 In time the Ammonites were called together, and they pitched camp in Gilead. So the Israelites gathered together and pitched camp in Mizpah. 18 The people and the princes of Gilead said to one another: \"Who will take the lead in fighting against the Ammonites? Let him become the chief over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\"\nChapter 11\n1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was Jephthah's father. 2 But Gilead's wife also bore him sons. When the sons of his wife grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him: \"You will have no inheritance in our father's household, for you are the son of another woman.\" 3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob. And idle men joined company with Jephthah, and they followed him.\n4 After a while, the Ammonites fought against Israel. 5 And when the Ammonites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead immediately went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob. 6 They said to Jephthah: \"Come and serve as our commander, so that we can fight against the Ammonites.\" 7 But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead: \"Was it not you who hated me so much that you drove me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?\" 8 At this the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah: \"That is why now we have returned to you. If you go with us and fight against the Ammonites, you will become our leader over all the inhabitants of Gilead.\" 9 So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead: \"If you bring me back to fight against the Ammonites and Jehovah defeats them for me, then I will indeed become your leader!\" 10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah: \"Let Jehovah be the witness between us if we do not do as you say.\" 11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. And Jephthah repeated all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.\n12 Jephthah then sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying: \"What do you have against me that you have come to attack my land?\" 13 So the king of the Ammonites said to the messengers of Jephthah: \"It is because Israel took my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and as far as the Jordan. Now return it peaceably.\" 14 But Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of the Ammonites 15 to say to him:\n\"This is what Jephthah says: 'Israel did not take the land of the Moabites and the land of the Ammonites, 16 for when they came up out of Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 17 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: \"Please let us pass through your land,\" but the king of Edom did not listen. Also to the king of Moab they sent word, but he did not consent. So Israel kept dwelling in Kadesh. 18 When they walked through the wilderness, they bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab. They traveled east of the land of Moab and camped in the region of the Arnon; they did not come within the boundary of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.\n19 \"'After that Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him: \"Please let us pass through your land to our own place.\" 20 But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped in Jahaz and fought against Israel. 21 At this Jehovah the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into Israel's hand, so that they defeated them and Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land. 22 Thus they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.\n23 \"'It was Jehovah the God of Israel who drove out the Amorites from before his people Israel, and now would you drive them out? 24 Do you not possess whatever your god Chemosh gives you to possess? So everyone whom Jehovah our God has driven out from before us is the one we will drive out. 25 Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 26 While Israel was dwelling in Heshbon and its dependent towns and in Aroer and its dependent towns and in all the cities that are by the banks of the Arnon for 300 years, why did you never try to take them back during that time? 27 I have not sinned against you, but you are wrong to attack me. Let Jehovah the Judge be judge today between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon.'\"\n28 But the king of the Ammonites would not listen to the message that Jephthah sent to him.\n29 Jehovah's spirit came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh to go to Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he continued on to the Ammonites.\n30 Then Jephthah made a vow to Jehovah and said: \"If you give the Ammonites into my hand, 31 then whoever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites will become Jehovah's, and I will offer that one up as a burnt offering.\"\n32 So Jephthah went to fight against the Ammonites, and Jehovah gave them into his hand. 33 He struck them down with a very great slaughter from Aroer all the way to Minnith-20 cities-and as far as Abel-keramim. Thus the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.\n34 Finally Jephthah came to his home in Mizpah, and look! his daughter was coming out to meet him, playing the tambourine and dancing! Now she was his one and only child. Besides her, he had neither son nor daughter. 35 When he saw her, he ripped his garments and said: \"Oh no, my daughter! You have broken my heart, for you have become the one I have banished. Now I have opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I am unable to turn back.\"\n36 But she said to him: \"My father, if you have opened your mouth to Jehovah, do to me as you have promised, since Jehovah has executed vengeance for you upon your enemies, the Ammonites.\" 37 She then said to her father: \"Let this be done for me: Let me be alone for two months, and let me go away into the mountains, and let me weep over my virginity with my female companions.\"\n38 At this he said: \"Go!\" So he sent her away for two months, and she went to the mountains with her companions to weep over her virginity. 39 At the end of two months, she returned to her father, after which he carried out the vow he had made regarding her. She never had relations with a man. And it became a custom in Israel: 40 From year to year, the young women of Israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.\nChapter 12\n1 Then the men of Ephraim were summoned, and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah: \"Why did you not call us to go with you when you crossed over to fight against the Ammonites? We will burn your house down with you in it.\" 2 But Jephthah said to them: \"Along with my people, I was engaged in a great conflict with the Ammonites. I did call to you for help, but you did not save me from their hand. 3 When I saw that you would not save me, then I decided to risk my life and go against the Ammonites, and Jehovah handed them over to me. So why have you come today to fight against me?\"\n4 Jephthah then gathered all the men of Gilead, and they fought Ephraim; the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, who had said: \"You are only fugitives from Ephraim, you Gileadites in Ephraim and Manasseh.\" 5 Gilead captured the fords of the Jordan ahead of Ephraim; and when the men of Ephraim were trying to escape, they would say, \"Let me cross over\"; then the men of Gilead would ask each one, \"Are you an Ephraimite?\" When he would reply, \"No!\" 6 they would say to him, \"Please say Shibboleth.\" But he would say, \"Sibboleth,\" as he was unable to say the word correctly. Then they would seize him and slay him at the fords of the Jordan. So 42,000 Ephraimites fell at that time.\n7 Jephthah judged Israel for six years, after which Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead.\n8 Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel after him. 9 He had 30 sons and 30 daughters. He sent his daughters to marry men outside his clan, and he brought in 30 women to marry his sons. He judged Israel for seven years. 10 Then Ibzan died and was buried in Bethlehem.\n11 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; he judged Israel for ten years. 12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.\n13 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 14 He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim in the mountain of the Amalekite.\nChapter 13\n1 Again the Israelites did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, and Jehovah gave them into the hand of the Philistines for 40 years.\n2 Meanwhile, there was a man of Zorah of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren and childless. 3 In time Jehovah's angel appeared to the woman and said to her: \"Look, you are barren and childless. But you will conceive and give birth to a son. 4 Now be careful not to drink wine or anything alcoholic, and do not eat anything unclean. 5 Look! You will conceive and give birth to a son, and no razor should touch his head, because the child will be a Nazirite of God from birth, and he will take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.\"\n6 Then the woman went and told her husband: \"A man of the true God came to me, and his appearance was like an angel of the true God, very awe-inspiring. I did not ask him where he was from, nor did he tell me his name. 7 But he said to me, 'Look! You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now do not drink wine or anything alcoholic, and do not eat anything unclean, because the child will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.'\"\n8 Manoah pleaded with Jehovah and said: \"Pardon me, Jehovah. Please let the man of the true God whom you just sent come again to instruct us about what we should do with the child who will be born.\" 9 So the true God listened to Manoah, and the angel of the true God came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field; her husband Manoah was not with her. 10 The woman quickly ran and told her husband: \"Look! The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.\"\n11 Then Manoah got up and went with his wife. He came to the man and said to him: \"Are you the man who spoke to my wife?\" He said: \"I am.\" 12 Then Manoah said: \"May your words come true! What will be the child's manner of life, and what will be his work?\" 13 So Jehovah's angel said to Manoah: \"Your wife should keep herself from everything that I mentioned to her. 14 She should not eat anything that the grapevine produces, she should not drink wine or anything alcoholic, and she should not eat anything unclean. Everything that I commanded her, let her observe.\"\n15 Manoah now said to Jehovah's angel: \"Please stay, and let us prepare a young goat for you.\" 16 But Jehovah's angel said to Manoah: \"If I stay, I will not eat your food; but if you wish to present a burnt offering to Jehovah, you may offer it up.\" Manoah did not know that he was Jehovah's angel. 17 Then Manoah said to Jehovah's angel: \"What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?\" 18 However, Jehovah's angel said to him: \"Why are you asking about my name, seeing that it is a wonderful one?\"\n19 Then Manoah took the young goat and the grain offering and offered them on the rock to Jehovah. And He was doing something amazing while Manoah and his wife were looking on. 20 As the flame ascended from the altar heavenward, Jehovah's angel ascended in the flame from the altar while Manoah and his wife were looking on. At once they fell with their faces to the ground. 21 Jehovah's angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah realized that he was Jehovah's angel. 22 Manoah then said to his wife: \"We are sure to die, because it is God whom we have seen.\" 23 But his wife said to him: \"If Jehovah wanted to put us to death, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hand, he would not have shown us all these things, and he would not have told us any of these things.\"\n24 The woman later gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and as the boy grew, Jehovah continued to bless him. 25 In time Jehovah's spirit started to impel him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\nChapter 14\n1 Then Samson went down to Timnah, and in Timnah he saw a Philistine woman. 2 So he went up and told his father and mother: \"In Timnah a Philistine woman caught my eye, and I want you to get her for me as a wife.\" 3 But his father and mother said to him: \"Can you not find a woman among your relatives and among all our people? Must you go and take a wife from among the uncircumcised Philistines?\" But Samson said to his father: \"Get her for me, because she is the right one for me.\" 4 His father and mother did not realize that this was from Jehovah, for He was looking for an opportunity against the Philistines, as the Philistines were ruling over Israel at that time.\n5 So Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah. When he reached the vineyards of Timnah, why look! a lion came roaring at him. 6 Then Jehovah's spirit empowered him, and he tore it in two, just as someone tears a young goat in two with his bare hands. But he did not tell his father or mother what he had done. 7 Then he went down and spoke to the woman, and she was still the right one in Samson's eyes.\n8 Later when he was going back to take her home, he turned aside to look at the dead body of the lion, and there in the lion's carcass was a swarm of bees and honey. 9 So he scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along. When he rejoined his father and mother, he gave them some to eat. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey out of the carcass of a lion.\n10 His father went down to the woman, and Samson held a banquet there, for that was what the young men used to do. 11 When they saw him, they brought 30 groomsmen to accompany him. 12 Then Samson said to them: \"Please let me tell you a riddle. If during the seven days of the banquet you solve it and tell me the answer, I will have to give you 30 linen garments and 30 outfits of clothing. 13 But if you are unable to tell me the answer, you must give me 30 linen garments and 30 outfits of clothing.\" They said: \"Tell us your riddle; we want to hear it.\" 14 So he said to them:\n\"Out of the eater came something to eat,\nAnd out of the strong came something sweet.\"\nThey were unable to solve the riddle for three days. 15 On the fourth day, they said to Samson's wife: \"Trick your husband so that he will tell us the answer to the riddle. Otherwise, we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Did you invite us here to take our possessions?\" 16 So Samson's wife wept over him and said: \"You must hate me; you do not love me. You told a riddle to my people, but you have not told the answer to me.\" At this he said to her: \"Why, I have not told it even to my own father and mother! Should I tell it to you?\" 17 But she kept weeping over him the rest of the seven-day banquet. He finally told her on the seventh day, because she had pressured him. Then she told her people the answer to the riddle. 18 So on the seventh day before the sun set, the men of the city said to him:\n\"What is sweeter than honey,\nAnd what is stronger than a lion?\"\nHe replied to them:\n\"If you had not plowed with my young cow,\nYou would not have solved my riddle.\"\n19 Then Jehovah's spirit empowered him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down 30 of their men and took their clothing and gave the outfits to those who had answered the riddle. He was furious as he went back up to his father's house.\n20 Samson's wife was then given to one of his groomsmen who had accompanied him.\nChapter 15\n1 After a while, in the days of the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing a young goat. He said: \"I wish to go in to my wife in the bedroom.\" But her father did not allow him to go in. 2 Her father said: \"I thought, 'You must surely hate her.' So I gave her to your groomsman. Is not her younger sister more attractive than she is? Please, take her instead.\" 3 However, Samson said to them: \"This time I cannot be blamed by the Philistines for harming them.\"\n4 So Samson went and caught 300 foxes. Then he took torches, turned the foxes tail to tail, and put one torch between each pair of tails. 5 Then he set fire to the torches and sent the foxes out into the fields of standing grain of the Philistines. He set on fire everything from sheaf to standing grain, as well as the vineyards and the olive groves.\n6 The Philistines asked: \"Who did this?\" They were told: \"It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his groomsman.\" At that the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire. 7 Then Samson said to them: \"If this is how you act, I will not quit until I take revenge on you.\" 8 Then he struck them down one after the other with a great slaughter, after which he went down and stayed in a cave of the crag Etam.\n9 Later the Philistines came up and camped in Judah and were tramping about in Lehi. 10 Then the men of Judah said: \"Why have you come up against us?\" to which they answered: \"We have come up to capture Samson, to do to him just as he did to us.\" 11 So 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cave of the crag Etam and said to Samson: \"Do you not know that the Philistines are ruling over us? So why have you done this to us?\" He said to them: \"As they did to me, so I did to them.\" 12 But they said to him: \"We have come to capture you and to hand you over to the Philistines.\" Then Samson said: \"Swear to me that you yourselves will not assault me.\" 13 They said to him: \"No, we will only tie you and hand you over to them, but we will not put you to death.\"\nSo they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the crag. 14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted triumphantly at meeting him. Then Jehovah's spirit empowered him, and the ropes on his arms became like linen threads that were scorched with fire, and his fetters melted off his hands. 15 He now found a fresh jawbone of a male donkey; he reached out and grabbed it and struck down 1,000 men with it. 16 Then Samson said:\n\"With the jawbone of a donkey-one heap, two heaps!\nWith the jawbone of a donkey I struck down 1,000 men.\"\n17 When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone away and called that place Ramath-lehi. 18 Then he became very thirsty, and he called on Jehovah and said: \"It was you who gave this great salvation into the hand of your servant. But now am I to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?\" 19 So God split open a hollow that was in Lehi, and water flowed from it. When he drank, his spirit returned and he revived. That is why he named the place En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.\n20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines for 20 years.\nChapter 16\n1 One time Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there, and he went in to her. 2 The Gazites were told: \"Samson has come here.\" So they surrounded him and lay in ambush for him all night long in the city gate. They stayed quiet the whole night, saying to themselves: \"When daylight comes, we will kill him.\"\n3 However, Samson kept lying there until midnight. Then he got up at midnight and grabbed the doors of the city gate and the two side posts and pulled them out along with the bar. He put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that faces Hebron.\n4 After that he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. 5 So the lords of the Philistines approached her and said: \"Trick him and find out what gives him such great strength and how we can overpower him and tie him and subdue him. For this we will each give you 1,100 silver pieces.\"\n6 Delilah later said to Samson: \"Please tell me where your great power comes from and what can be used to tie you and subdue you.\" 7 Samson said to her: \"If they tie me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried out, I will grow as weak as an ordinary man.\" 8 So the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried out, and she tied him with them. 9 Now they set an ambush in the inner room, and she called out to him: \"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" At that he tore apart the bowstrings, just as easily as a thread of flax comes apart when it touches fire. The secret of his power did not become known.\n10 Then Delilah said to Samson: \"Look! You have fooled me and told me lies. Now tell me, please, what can be used to tie you.\" 11 So he said to her: \"If they tie me up with new ropes that have not been used for work, I will grow as weak as an ordinary man.\" 12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them and called out: \"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" (All the while the ambush was set in the inner room.) At that he tore them off his arms like threads.\n13 After that Delilah said to Samson: \"Up until now you have fooled me and told me lies. Tell me what can be used to tie you.\" Then he said to her: \"If you weave the seven braids of my head with the warp thread.\" 14 So she fixed them with a pin and called out to him: \"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" So he woke up from his sleep and pulled out the loom pin and the warp thread.\n15 She now said to him: \"How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? These three times you have fooled me and have not told me the source of your great power.\" 16 Because day after day she kept nagging him and pressuring him, he was weary to the point of dying. 17 So he finally opened his heart to her, saying: \"A razor has never touched my head, because I am a Nazirite of God from birth. If I am shaved, my power will leave me and I will grow weak and become like all other men.\"\n18 When Delilah saw that he had opened his heart to her, she immediately summoned the Philistine lords, saying: \"Come up this time, for he has opened his heart to me.\" So the Philistine lords came up to her, bringing the money with them. 19 She made him fall asleep on her knees; then she called the man and had him shave off the seven braids of his head. After that she began to have control over him, for his power was leaving him. 20 Now she called out: \"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\" He woke up from his sleep and said: \"I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.\" But he did not know that Jehovah had left him. 21 So the Philistines seized him and bored his eyes out. Then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with two copper fetters, and he became a grinder of grain in the prison. 22 But the hair of his head started to grow back again after he had been shaved.\n23 The Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, for they were saying: \"Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand!\" 24 When the people saw him, they praised their god and said: \"Our god has given into our hand our enemy, the one who devastated our land and killed so many of us.\"\n25 Because their heart was cheerful, they said: \"Call Samson to provide us some amusement.\" So they called Samson out of the prison to entertain them; they made him stand between the pillars. 26 Then Samson said to the boy holding him by the hand: \"Let me feel the pillars that support the house, so that I can lean against them.\" 27 (Incidentally, the house was full of men and women. All the Philistine lords were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women who were looking on while Samson provided amusement.)\n28 Samson now called out to Jehovah: \"Sovereign Lord Jehovah, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, just this once, O God, and let me take revenge on the Philistines for one of my two eyes.\"\n29 Then Samson braced himself against the two middle pillars that supported the house, and he leaned on them with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other. 30 Samson called out: \"Let me die with the Philistines!\" Then he pushed with all his might, and the house fell on the lords and all the people in it. So he killed more at his death than he had killed during his life.\n31 Later his brothers and all his father's family came down to take him back. They brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel for 20 years.\nChapter 17\n1 There was a man of the mountainous region of Ephraim named Micah. 2 He said to his mother: \"The 1,100 silver pieces that were taken from you about which you pronounced a curse, which I heard-look! the silver is with me. I was the one who took it.\" At that his mother said: \"May Jehovah bless my son.\" 3 So he gave the 1,100 pieces of silver back to his mother, but his mother said: \"I will without fail sanctify the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son to use in making a carved image and a metal statue. Now I give it back to you.\"\n4 After he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 silver pieces and gave them to the silversmith. He made a carved image and a metal statue; and they were put in Micah's house. 5 This man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod and teraphim statues and installed one of his sons to serve as priest for him. 6 In those days, there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.\n7 Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah who was of the family of Judah. He was a Levite who had been living there for a time. 8 The man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to find a place to live. While on his journey, he came to the mountainous region of Ephraim, to the house of Micah. 9 Then Micah said to him: \"Where do you come from?\" He replied: \"I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find a place to live.\" 10 So Micah said to him: \"Stay with me and serve as a father and a priest for me. I will give you ten silver pieces a year and a set of garments and your food.\" So the Levite went in. 11 Thus the Levite agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons. 12 Furthermore, Micah installed the Levite to serve as a priest for him, and he lived in the house of Micah. 13 Then Micah said: \"Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, for the Levite has become my priest.\"\nChapter 18\n1 In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was looking for an inheritance to dwell in, because until then they had not received an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.\n2 The Danites sent five men from among their family, capable men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. They said to them: \"Go, explore the land.\" When they came to the mountainous region of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they spent the night there. 3 While they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite man, so they went over to him and asked: \"Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is keeping you here?\" 4 He replied to them: \"Thus and so Micah did for me, and he hired me to serve as priest for him.\" 5 Then they said to him: \"Please ask God whether our journey will be successful.\" 6 The priest said to them: \"Go in peace. Jehovah is with you on your journey.\"\n7 So the five men went on and came to Laish. They saw how the people in it were dwelling in self-reliance in the manner of the Sidonians. They were quiet and unsuspecting, and no oppressive conqueror was in the land to disturb them. They were far away from the Sidonians, and they had no dealings with anyone else.\n8 When they returned to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them: \"How did it go?\" 9 They replied: \"Let us go up against them, for we have seen that the land is very good. Why are you hesitant? Do not delay to go in to take possession of the land. 10 When you arrive, you will find an unsuspecting people, and the land is spacious. God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth.\"\n11 Then 600 men armed for battle from the family of the Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol. 12 They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why that place, which is west of Kiriath-jearim, is called Mahaneh-dan to this day. 13 They went from there to the mountainous region of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.\n14 Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish said to their brothers: \"Did you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim statues, a carved image, and a metal statue? Think about what you should do.\" 15 So they stopped there and came to the house of the young Levite man at the house of Micah and asked how he was. 16 All the while the 600 men of Dan, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate. 17 The five men who had gone to spy out the land went inside to take the carved image, the ephod, the teraphim statues, and the metal image. (The priest was standing at the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed for battle.) 18 They went into the house of Micah and took the carved image, the ephod, the teraphim statues, and the metal image. The priest said to them: \"What are you doing?\" 19 But they said to him: \"Be quiet. Put your hand over your mouth, and come with us to be a father and a priest for us. Which is better-for you to be a priest to the house of one man or to become a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?\" 20 So the priest was satisfied, and he took the ephod, the teraphim statues, and the carved image and went off with the people.\n21 Then they turned to go on their way, putting the children, the livestock, and the valuable things ahead of them. 22 They had gone some distance away from the house of Micah when the men who lived in the houses near the house of Micah gathered together and caught up with the Danites. 23 When they cried out to the Danites, they turned to face them and said to Micah: \"What is the matter? Why have you been gathered together?\" 24 So he said: \"You have taken my gods that I made, and you have gone off with the priest too. What do I have left? How, then, can you ask me, 'What is the matter with you?'\" 25 The Danites replied: \"Do not raise your voice against us; otherwise, angry men may assault you, and that would cost you your life and the lives of your household.\" 26 So the Danites went on their way; and Micah, seeing that they were stronger than he was, turned and went back to his house.\n27 After they took what Micah had made, as well as his priest, they went to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting. They struck them down with the sword and burned the city with fire. 28 There was no one to rescue it, for it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone else and it was in the valley plain that belonged to Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and settled in it. 29 Furthermore, they named the city Dan after the name of their father, Dan, who was born to Israel. But Laish was the city's former name. 30 After that the Danites set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons became priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day that the inhabitants of the land went into exile. 31 And they set up the carved image that Micah had made, and it remained there all the days that the house of the true God was in Shiloh.\nChapter 19\n1 In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a Levite who was then living in a remote part of the mountainous region of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah as his wife. 2 But his concubine was unfaithful to him, and she left him to go to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah. She remained there for four months. 3 Then her husband went after her to persuade her to come back; he had his male attendant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father's house. When her father saw him, he was glad to meet him. 4 So his father-in-law, the young woman's father, convinced him to stay with him three days; and they would eat and drink, and he would spend the night there.\n5 On the fourth day, when they got up early in the morning to go, the father of the young woman said to his son-in-law: \"Eat something to give you strength, and then you may go.\" 6 So they sat down, and they both ate and drank together; after that the father of the young woman said to the man: \"Please, stay overnight and enjoy yourself.\" 7 When the man rose to go, his father-in-law kept begging him, so he stayed overnight again.\n8 When he got up early in the morning on the fifth day to go, the father of the young woman said: \"Please, eat something to give you strength.\" And they lingered until it was late in the day, and they both kept eating. 9 When the man rose to go with his concubine and his attendant, his father-in-law, the young woman's father, said to him: \"Look, now! It is almost evening. Please, stay overnight. Here the day is coming to an end. Stay here overnight and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early for your journey and go to your home.\" 10 However, the man did not want to stay another night, so he got up and traveled as far as Jebus, that is, Jerusalem. He had with him the two saddled donkeys, his concubine, and his attendant.\n11 When they were close to Jebus, the daylight was nearly gone. So the attendant said to his master: \"Should we stop at this city of the Jebusites and stay overnight here?\" 12 But his master said to him: \"We should not stop at a city of foreigners who are not Israelites. We will go on as far as Gibeah.\" 13 Then he said to his attendant: \"Come and let us try to reach one of those places; we will stay overnight either in Gibeah or in Ramah.\" 14 So they went on their way, and the sun began to set when they were near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.\n15 So they stopped there and went in to stay overnight in Gibeah. Once inside, they sat down in the public square of the city, but nobody took them into his house to stay overnight. 16 Eventually that evening, an old man came in from his work in the field. He was from the mountainous region of Ephraim, and he was living for a time in Gibeah; but the residents of the city were Benjaminites. 17 When he looked up and saw the traveler in the public square of the city, the old man said: \"Where are you going, and where do you come from?\" 18 He replied: \"We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area of the mountainous region of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to the house of Jehovah, but nobody is taking me into his house. 19 We have enough straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me, the woman, and our attendant. There is nothing lacking.\" 20 However, the old man said: \"May you have peace! Let me take care of anything you need. Just do not stay overnight in the public square.\" 21 So he brought him into his house and gave feed to the donkeys. Then they washed their feet and ate and drank.\n22 While they were enjoying themselves, some worthless men of the city surrounded the house and were pounding on the door, and they kept saying to the old man who owned the house: \"Bring out the man who came into your house, so that we may have sex with him.\" 23 At that the owner of the house went out and said to them: \"No, my brothers, do not act wickedly. Please, this man is a guest in my house. Do not commit this disgraceful act. 24 Here are my virgin daughter and this man's concubine. Let me bring them out, and you can humiliate them if you must. But you must not commit this disgraceful act toward this man.\"\n25 But the men refused to listen to him, so the man grabbed hold of his concubine and brought her outside to them. They raped her and abused her all night long until the morning. Then they sent her away at the break of dawn. 26 Early in the morning, the woman came and fell down at the entrance of the man's house where her master was and lay there until it was light. 27 When her master got up in the morning and opened the doors of the house to go out to resume his journey, he saw the woman, his concubine, lying at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold. 28 So he said to her: \"Get up; let us go.\" But there was no answer. The man then put her on the donkey and set out for his home.\n29 When he reached his house, he took the slaughtering knife and took hold of his concubine and cut her up limb by limb into 12 pieces and sent one piece into each territory of Israel. 30 All who saw it said: \"Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt down to this day. Consider it, take counsel, and tell us what to do.\"\nChapter 20\n1 Consequently, all the Israelites came out from Dan down to Beer-sheba and from the land of Gilead, and the entire assembly gathered unitedly before Jehovah at Mizpah. 2 So the chiefs of the people and all the tribes of Israel took their places in the congregation of God's people-400,000 foot soldiers armed with swords.\n3 The Benjaminites heard that the men of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.\nThen the men of Israel said: \"Tell us, how did this terrible thing happen?\" 4 At this the Levite man, the husband of the murdered woman, said in answer: \"I came to Gibeah of Benjamin with my concubine to stay overnight. 5 And the inhabitants of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house by night. They meant to kill me, but they raped my concubine instead, and she died. 6 So I took my concubine's body and cut it up and sent the pieces into every part of Israel's inheritance, because they had committed a shameful and disgraceful act in Israel. 7 Now all you people of Israel, give your advice and counsel here.\"\n8 Then all the people rose up in unison and said: \"Not one of us will go to his tent or return to his house. 9 Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot. 10 We will take 10 men out of 100 from all the tribes of Israel, and 100 out of 1,000 and 1,000 out of 10,000 to collect provisions for the army, so that they may take action against Gibeah of Benjamin, in view of the disgraceful act that they committed in Israel.\" 11 Thus all the men of Israel were gathered against the city united as allies.\n12 Then the tribes of Israel sent men to all the tribesmen of Benjamin, saying: \"What is this terrible thing that has happened among you? 13 Now hand over the worthless men from Gibeah, so that we may put them to death and clear out what is bad from Israel.\" But the Benjaminites refused to listen to their Israelite brothers.\n14 Then the Benjaminites gathered together out of the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the men of Israel. 15 That day the Benjaminites mustered from their cities 26,000 men armed with swords, apart from the 700 chosen men of Gibeah. 16 In this army were 700 chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of these men could sling a stone to within a hairbreadth and would not miss.\n17 The men of Israel apart from Benjamin mustered 400,000 men armed with swords, and each one was an experienced warrior. 18 They rose up and went up to Bethel to inquire of God. Then the people of Israel said: \"Who of us should go up in the lead to the battle against the Benjaminites?\" Jehovah replied: \"Judah is to take the lead.\"\n19 After that the Israelites rose up in the morning and camped against Gibeah.\n20 The men of Israel now went out to battle against Benjamin; they drew up in battle formation against them at Gibeah. 21 So the Benjaminites came out from Gibeah and struck down 22,000 men of Israel on that day. 22 However, the army of the men of Israel showed themselves courageous and again drew up in battle formation in the same place as on the first day. 23 Then the Israelites went up and wept before Jehovah until the evening and inquired of Jehovah: \"Should we again go into battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?\" To this Jehovah said: \"Go up against them.\"\n24 So the Israelites drew near to the Benjaminites on the second day. 25 In turn Benjamin came out from Gibeah to meet them on the second day and struck down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords. 26 At that all the men of Israel went up to Bethel. They wept and sat there before Jehovah, and they fasted on that day until the evening and offered up burnt offerings and communion offerings before Jehovah. 27 After that the men of Israel inquired of Jehovah, for the ark of the covenant of the true God was there in those days. 28 Now Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was ministering before it in those days. They asked: \"Should we go out yet again to battle against our brothers, the men of Benjamin, or should we stop?\" Jehovah replied: \"Go up, because tomorrow I will give them into your hand.\" 29 Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.\n30 The Israelites went up against the Benjaminites on the third day, and they drew up in formation against Gibeah the same as at the other times. 31 When the Benjaminites went out to meet the army, they were drawn away from the city. Then, as at the other times, they started to attack and kill some of the men on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, leaving about 30 men of Israel dead in the open field. 32 So the Benjaminites said: \"They are suffering defeat before us the same as before.\" But the Israelites said: \"We will retreat and draw them away from the city onto the highways.\" 33 So all the men of Israel rose up from their places and drew up in formation at Baal-tamar while the Israelite ambush charged out of their places in the vicinity of Gibeah. 34 Thus 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel came in front of Gibeah, and the fighting was heavy. But the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was near at hand.\n35 Jehovah defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 men in Benjamin, all of them armed with swords.\n36 However, the Benjaminites imagined that the men of Israel would be defeated when they retreated from Benjamin, but they retreated because they trusted in the ambush that was set against Gibeah. 37 The ambush acted quickly and charged toward Gibeah. Then the ambush spread out and struck down the whole city with the sword.\n38 Now the men of Israel had arranged that the men who ambushed the city would make a smoke signal go up from there.\n39 When the Israelites turned around in the battle, the men of Benjamin started by attacking and killing about 30 men of Israel, and they said: \"They are clearly suffering another defeat before us, just as in the previous battle.\" 40 But the signal started to go up from the city as a pillar of smoke. When the men of Benjamin turned to look, they saw the whole city going up in flames to the sky. 41 Then the men of Israel made an about-face, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster had overtaken them. 42 So they retreated from the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle followed them; the men coming out of the cities joined in striking them down. 43 They surrounded the Benjaminites and pursued them relentlessly. They trampled them down directly in front of Gibeah toward the east. 44 Finally 18,000 men of Benjamin fell, all mighty warriors.\n45 The men of Benjamin turned and fled into the wilderness to the crag of Rimmon, and the Israelites killed 5,000 of them on the highways, and they kept pursuing them as far as Gidom; so they struck down 2,000 more men. 46 All those of Benjamin who fell on that day amounted to 25,000 men armed with swords, all mighty warriors. 47 But 600 retreated into the wilderness to the crag of Rimmon, and they stayed on the crag of Rimmon for four months.\n48 And the men of Israel turned back against the Benjaminites and struck those of the city with the sword, from men to livestock, all that remained. Also, they set all the cities in their path on fire.\nChapter 21\n1 Now the men of Israel had sworn this oath in Mizpah: \"Not one of us will give his daughter to a man from Benjamin as a wife.\" 2 Consequently, the people came to Bethel and sat there before the true God until evening, crying out and weeping bitterly. 3 And they were saying: \"Why, O Jehovah the God of Israel, has this happened in Israel? Why should one tribe be missing today from Israel?\" 4 And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there to offer up burnt offerings and communion offerings.\n5 Then the people of Israel said: \"Who of all the tribes of Israel did not come up to assemble before Jehovah?\" for they had taken a great oath that anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizpah would be put to death without fail. 6 So the people of Israel felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin their brother. They said: \"Today one tribe has been chopped off from Israel. 7 What should we do to provide wives for those who are left, now that we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them any of our daughters as wives?\"\n8 They asked: \"Who among the tribes of Israel did not come up to Jehovah at Mizpah?\" It so happened that no one had come from Jabesh-gilead into the camp where the congregation was. 9 When the people were counted, they saw that none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead were there. 10 So the assembly sent there 12,000 of the mightiest men. They commanded them: \"Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword, even the women and the children. 11 This is what you should do: Every male, as well as every woman who has had sexual relations with a male, you should devote to destruction.\" 12 Among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead, they found 400 girls who were virgins, who had never had sexual relations with a man. So they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n13 Then all the assembly sent a message to the Benjaminites on the crag of Rimmon and offered them peace. 14 So Benjamin came back at that time. They gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they did not find enough for them. 15 And the people felt sorrow over what had happened to Benjamin because Jehovah had made a division among the tribes of Israel. 16 The elders of the assembly said: \"What should we do to provide wives for the remaining men, since all the women were annihilated out of Benjamin?\" 17 They replied: \"There should be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe may not be wiped out of Israel. 18 But we are not allowed to give them wives from our daughters, because the people of Israel have sworn: 'Cursed is the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'\"\n19 Then they said: \"Look! There is a festival of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel and east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem and south of Lebonah.\" 20 So they commanded the men of Benjamin: \"Go and set an ambush in the vineyards. 21 And when you see the young women of Shiloh come out to join in their circle dances, each of you should come out from the vineyards and seize a wife from the young women of Shiloh, and you should return to the land of Benjamin. 22 And should their fathers or their brothers come to make a complaint against us, we will then tell them, 'Show us favor for their sakes, because we could not provide each one a wife by war and you could not give a wife to them without becoming guilty.'\"\n23 So the men of Benjamin did just that, and they each carried off a wife from the women who were dancing. After that they went back to their inheritance and rebuilt their cities and settled in them.\n24 And the Israelites dispersed from there at that time, each one to his tribe and his family, and they departed from there, each one to his inheritance.\n25 In those days there was no king in Israel. Each one was doing what was right in his own eyes.\n",

    "text": "Ruth\nChapter 1\n1 Now in the days when the judges administered justice, a famine occurred in the land; and a man went from Bethlehem in Judah to reside as a foreigner in the fields of Moab, he along with his wife and his two sons. 2 The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. And they came to the fields of Moab and remained there.\n3 After some time Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 4 The men later married Moabite women; one was named Orpah, and the other was named Ruth. They remained there for about ten years. 5 Then the two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, also died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband. 6 So she started out with her daughters-in-law to return from the fields of Moab, for she had heard in Moab that Jehovah had turned his attention to his people by giving them food.\n7 She left the place where she had been living with both of her daughters-in-law. As they were walking on the road to return to the land of Judah, 8 Naomi said to both of her daughters-in-law: \"Go, return, each of you to your mother's home. May Jehovah show loyal love to you, just as you have shown it to the men who have died and to me. 9 May Jehovah grant that each of you finds security in the home of your husband.\" Then she kissed them, and they wept loudly. 10 They kept saying to her: \"No, but we will go with you to your people.\" 11 But Naomi said: \"Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still give birth to sons who could become your husbands? 12 Return, my daughters. Go, for I have grown too old to marry. Even if I could hope to find a husband tonight and could also bear sons, 13 would you keep waiting for them until they could grow up? Would you refrain from getting remarried for their sakes? No, my daughters, I feel very bitter for you, because the hand of Jehovah has turned against me.\"\n14 Again they wept loudly, after which Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and departed. But Ruth stuck with her. 15 So Naomi said: \"Look! Your widowed sister-in-law has returned to her people and her gods. Return with your sister-in-law.\"\n16 But Ruth said: \"Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you; for where you go I will go, and where you spend the night, I will spend the night. Your people will be my people, and your God my God. 17 Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May Jehovah do so to me and add to it if anything but death should separate me from you.\"\n18 When Naomi saw that Ruth insisted on going with her, she stopped trying to convince her. 19 And they both continued on their way until they came to Bethlehem. As soon as they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole city became stirred up over them, and women were saying: \"Is this Naomi?\" 20 She would say to the women: \"Do not call me Naomi. Call me Mara, for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me. 21 I was full when I went, but Jehovah made me return empty-handed. Why should you call me Naomi, when it is Jehovah who opposed me and the Almighty who caused me calamity?\"\n22 This is how Naomi returned from the fields of Moab, along with her Moabite daughter-in-law Ruth. They came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.\nChapter 2\n1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side who was very wealthy; his name was Boaz, and he was of the family of Elimelech.\n2 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi: \"Let me go out, please, to the fields and glean among the ears of grain behind whoever looks on me with favor.\" So Naomi said to her: \"Go, my daughter.\" 3 At that she went out and began to glean in the field behind the harvesters. By chance she came upon a plot of land belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters: \"Jehovah be with you.\" And they replied: \"Jehovah bless you.\"\n5 Boaz then asked the young man in charge of the harvesters: \"To whom does this young woman belong?\" 6 The young man in charge of the harvesters answered: \"The young woman is a Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the fields of Moab. 7 She asked, 'Please, may I glean and gather among the cut-off ears of grain left behind by the harvesters?' And she has been on her feet since she came this morning until just now, when she sat in the shelter for a short rest.\"\n8 Then Boaz said to Ruth: \"Listen, my daughter. Do not go away to glean in another field, and do not go anywhere else; stay close by my young women. 9 Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest, and go with them. I have commanded the young men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the young men have drawn.\"\n10 At that she fell facedown and bowed down to the ground and said to him: \"How have I found favor in your eyes, and why have you taken notice of me, when I am a foreigner?\" 11 Boaz answered her: \"A full report was made to me of all you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your relatives to go to a people whom you had not known before. 12 May Jehovah reward you for what you have done, and may there be a perfect wage for you from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.\" 13 To this she said: \"Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord, because you have comforted me and spoken reassuringly to your servant, although I am not even one of your servants.\"\n14 Boaz said to her at mealtime: \"Come here, eat some of the bread, and dip your piece in the vinegar.\" So she sat down beside the harvesters. He then handed her some roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied, and she had something left over. 15 When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men: \"Let her glean even among the cut-off ears of grain, and do not mistreat her. 16 You should also be sure to pull out some ears of grain from the bundles for her and leave them behind for her to glean, and do not say anything to stop her.\"\n17 So she continued to glean in the field until evening. When she beat out what she had gleaned, it came to about an ephah of barley. 18 Then she took it and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth also took out and gave to her the food that was left over after she had eaten her fill.\n19 Her mother-in-law then said to her: \"Where did you glean today? Where did you work? May the one who took notice of you be blessed.\" So she told her mother-in-law about whom she had worked with, saying: \"The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz.\" 20 At that Naomi said to her daughter-in-law: \"May he be blessed by Jehovah, who has not failed in his loyal love toward the living and the dead.\" Naomi continued: \"The man is related to us. He is one of our repurchasers.\" 21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said: \"He also told me, 'Stay close by my young people until they have finished my entire harvest.'\" 22 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth: \"It is better, my daughter, for you to go out with his young women than to be harassed in another field.\"\n23 So she stayed close to the young women of Boaz and gleaned until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest came to an end. And she kept dwelling with her mother-in-law.\nChapter 3\n1 Naomi, her mother-in-law, now said to her: \"My daughter, should I not look for a home for you, so that it may go well with you? 2 Is not Boaz our relative? He is the one whose young women you were with. Tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor. 3 So wash yourself and rub on some perfumed oil; then dress up and go down to the threshing floor. Do not make your presence known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 4 When he lies down, take note of the place where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what you should do.\"\n5 At that she replied: \"All that you say to me I will do.\" 6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law had instructed her to do. 7 Meanwhile, Boaz ate and drank and was feeling good at heart. Then he went to lie down at the end of the grain heap. After that she quietly came and uncovered his feet and lay down. 8 At midnight the man began to shiver, and he leaned forward and saw a woman lying at his feet. 9 He said: \"Who are you?\" She replied: \"I am Ruth, your servant. Spread out your garment over your servant, for you are a repurchaser.\" 10 At that he said: \"May Jehovah bless you, my daughter. You have shown your loyal love more in this last instance than in the first instance, by not going after the young men, whether poor or rich. 11 And now, my daughter, have no fear. I will do for you everything that you say, for everyone in the city knows that you are an excellent woman. 12 While it is true that I am a repurchaser, there is a repurchaser more closely related than I am. 13 Stay here tonight, and if he will repurchase you in the morning, fine! Let him repurchase you. But if he does not want to repurchase you, I will then repurchase you myself, as surely as Jehovah lives. Lie down here until the morning.\"\n14 So she lay at his feet until the morning and then got up before it was light enough for anyone to be recognized. He then said: \"Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.\" 15 He also said: \"Bring the cloak that you are wearing, and hold it out.\" So she held it out, and he put six measures of barley in it and put it on her, after which he went into the city.\n16 She went her way to her mother-in-law, who now said: \"How did it go for you, my daughter?\" She told her everything that the man had done for her. 17 She added: \"He gave me these six measures of barley and said to me, 'Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.'\" 18 At that she said: \"Sit here, my daughter, until you learn how the matter will turn out, for the man will not rest until he settles the matter today.\"\nChapter 4\n1 Now Boaz went up to the city gate and sat there. And look! the repurchaser whom Boaz had mentioned passed by. At that Boaz said: \"Come here and sit down, So-and-so.\" And he went over and sat down. 2 Then Boaz took ten of the city elders and said: \"Sit down here.\" So they sat down.\n3 Boaz now said to the repurchaser: \"Naomi, who has returned from the fields of Moab, must sell the plot of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech. 4 So I thought I should disclose it to you and say, 'Buy it in front of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will repurchase it, repurchase it. But if you will not repurchase it, tell me so that I will know, for you have the claim to repurchase it, and I am next in line after you.'\" He replied: \"I am willing to repurchase it.\" 5 Then Boaz said: \"On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead man, in order to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance.\" 6 To this the repurchaser said: \"I am unable to repurchase it, for I may ruin my own inheritance. Repurchase it for yourself with my right of repurchase, because I am not able to repurchase it.\"\n7 Now this was the custom of former times in Israel concerning the right of repurchase and exchange to validate every sort of transaction: A man had to remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was the manner of confirming an agreement in Israel. 8 So when the repurchaser said to Boaz, \"Buy it for yourself,\" he removed his sandal. 9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people: \"You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon. 10 I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, as a wife to restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance, so that the name of the dead man will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the city gate of his home. You are witnesses today.\"\n11 At this all the people who were in the city gate and the elders said: \"We are witnesses! May Jehovah grant the wife who is entering your house to be like Rachel and like Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel. May you prosper in Ephrathah and make a good name in Bethlehem. 12 May your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the offspring that Jehovah will give you by this young woman.\"\n13 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. He had relations with her, and Jehovah let her conceive and she gave birth to a son. 14 Then the women said to Naomi: \"Praised be Jehovah, who has not left you without a repurchaser today. May his name be proclaimed in Israel! 15 He has restored your life and will sustain you in your old age, because he has been born to your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons.\" 16 Naomi took the child and held him to her bosom, and she cared for him. 17 Then the neighbor women gave him a name. They said, \"A son has been born to Naomi,\" and they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, David's father.\n18 Now this is the family line of Perez: Perez became father to Hezron; 19 Hezron became father to Ram; Ram became father to Amminadab; 20 Amminadab became father to Nahshon; Nahshon became father to Salmon; 21 Salmon became father to Boaz; Boaz became father to Obed; 22 Obed became father to Jesse; and Jesse became father to David. \n",

    "text": "Ezra\nChapter 1\n1 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that Jehovah's word spoken by Jeremiah would be fulfilled, Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom, which he also put in writing, saying:\n2 \"This is what King Cyrus of Persia says, 'Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 3 Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel-he is the true God-whose house was in Jerusalem. 4 Anyone who is residing as a foreigner, wherever he may be, let him be helped by his neighbors by their giving him silver and gold, goods and livestock, along with the voluntary offering for the house of the true God, which was in Jerusalem.'\"\n5 Then the heads of the paternal houses of Judah and of Benjamin and the priests and the Levites-everyone whose spirit the true God had stirred-prepared to go up and rebuild the house of Jehovah, which was in Jerusalem. 6 All those around them supported them by giving them utensils of silver and of gold, goods, livestock, and valuable things, besides all the voluntary offerings.\n7 King Cyrus also brought out the utensils of the house of Jehovah that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had put in the house of his god. 8 King Cyrus of Persia brought them out under the supervision of Mithredath the treasurer, who made an inventory of them for Sheshbazzar the chieftain of Judah.\n9 Now this was the inventory: 30 basket-shaped vessels of gold, 1,000 basket-shaped vessels of silver, 29 replacement vessels, 10 30 small gold bowls, 410 small silver bowls, 1,000 other utensils. 11 All the utensils of gold and of silver were 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought all of these up when the exiles were brought out of Babylon to Jerusalem.\nChapter 2\n1 And these were the people of the province who came up from the captives of the exile, those whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had exiled to Babylon and who later returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city, 2 those who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.\nThe number of the Israelite men included: 3 the sons of Parosh, 2,172; 4 the sons of Shephatiah, 372; 5 the sons of Arah, 775; 6 the sons of Pahath-moab, of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, 2,812; 7 the sons of Elam, 1,254; 8 the sons of Zattu, 945; 9 the sons of Zaccai, 760; 10 the sons of Bani, 642; 11 the sons of Bebai, 623; 12 the sons of Azgad, 1,222; 13 the sons of Adonikam, 666; 14 the sons of Bigvai, 2,056; 15 the sons of Adin, 454; 16 the sons of Ater, of Hezekiah, 98; 17 the sons of Bezai, 323; 18 the sons of Jorah, 112; 19 the sons of Hashum, 223; 20 the sons of Gibbar, 95; 21 the sons of Bethlehem, 123; 22 the men of Netophah, 56; 23 the men of Anathoth, 128; 24 the sons of Azmaveth, 42; 25 the sons of Kiriath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, 743; 26 the sons of Ramah and Geba, 621; 27 the men of Michmas, 122; 28 the men of Bethel and Ai, 223; 29 the sons of Nebo, 52; 30 the sons of Magbish, 156; 31 the sons of the other Elam, 1,254; 32 the sons of Harim, 320; 33 the sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, 725; 34 the sons of Jericho, 345; 35 the sons of Senaah, 3,630.\n36 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah of the house of Jeshua, 973; 37 the sons of Immer, 1,052; 38 the sons of Pashhur, 1,247; 39 the sons of Harim, 1,017.\n40 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah, 74. 41 The singers: the sons of Asaph, 128. 42 The sons of the gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, altogether 139.\n43 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth, 44 the sons of Keros, the sons of Siaha, the sons of Padon, 45 the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Akkub, 46 the sons of Hagab, the sons of Salmai, the sons of Hanan, 47 the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, the sons of Reaiah, 48 the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, the sons of Gazzam, 49 the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, the sons of Besai, 50 the sons of Asnah, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephusim, 51 the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur, 52 the sons of Bazluth, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha, 53 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah, 54 the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.\n55 The sons of the servants of Solomon: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Peruda, 56 the sons of Jaalah, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel, 57 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Ami.\n58 All the temple servants and the sons of the servants of Solomon were 392.\n59 And these went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they were unable to verify their paternal house and their origin, as to whether they were Israelites: 60 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 652. 61 And of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name. 62 These looked for their records to establish their genealogy, but they did not find them, so they were disqualified from the priesthood. 63 The governor told them that they could not eat from the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.\n64 The total number of the entire congregation was 42,360, 65 apart from their male and female slaves, who were 7,337; they also had 200 male and female singers. 66 Their horses were 736, their mules 245, 67 their camels 435, their donkeys 6,720.\n68 When they arrived at the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the paternal houses made voluntary offerings for the house of the true God, to rebuild it on its own site. 69 According to their means, they gave to the project treasury 61,000 gold drachmas, 5,000 silver minas, and 100 robes for the priests. 70 And the priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants settled in their cities, and all the rest of Israel settled in their cities.\nChapter 3\n1 When the seventh month arrived and the Israelites were in their cities, they gathered together with one accord in Jerusalem. 2 Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers rose up and built the altar of the God of Israel, so that they could offer up burnt sacrifices on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of the true God.\n3 So they set the altar up on its former site, despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands, and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on it, the morning and the evening burnt sacrifices. 4 Then they held the Festival of Booths according to what is written, and day by day they offered up the specified number of burnt sacrifices that were required each day. 5 Afterward they offered up the regular burnt offering and the offerings for the new moons and those for all the sanctified festival seasons of Jehovah, as well as those from everyone who willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah. 6 From the first day of the seventh month they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah, though the foundation of Jehovah's temple had not yet been laid.\n7 They gave money to the stonecutters and the craftsmen, and food and drink and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians for bringing cedar timbers by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, according to the authorization granted them by King Cyrus of Persia.\n8 In the second year after they came to the house of the true God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come to Jerusalem out of the captivity started the work; they appointed the Levites from 20 years old and up to serve as supervisors over the work of the house of Jehovah. 9 So Jeshua, his sons and his brothers, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, joined together to supervise those doing the work in the house of the true God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons and their brothers, the Levites.\n10 When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of King David of Israel. 11 And they began to sing in response by praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, \"for he is good; his loyal love toward Israel endures forever.\" Then all the people shouted with a loud shout of praise to Jehovah because the foundation of the house of Jehovah had been laid. 12 Many of the priests, the Levites, and the heads of the paternal houses-the old men who had seen the former house-wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, while many others shouted joyfully at the top of their voice. 13 So the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shouts from the sound of the weeping, for the people were shouting so loudly that the sound was heard from a great distance.\nChapter 4\n1 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to Jehovah the God of Israel, 2 they immediately approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the paternal houses and said to them: \"Let us build along with you; for like you, we worship your God and we have been sacrificing to him since the days of King Esar-haddon of Assyria, who brought us here.\" 3 However, Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the paternal houses of Israel said to them: \"You have no share with us in building a house to our God, for we alone will build it to Jehovah the God of Israel, just as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.\"\n4 Then the people of the land were continually discouraging the people of Judah and disheartening them from building. 5 They hired advisers against them to frustrate their plans all the days of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Darius of Persia. 6 At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 7 And in the days of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes the king; they translated the letter into Aramaic, writing it with Aramaic characters.\n8 Rehum the chief government official and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows: 9 (It was from Rehum the chief government official and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues, the judges and the lesser governors, the secretaries, the people of Erech, the Babylonians, the inhabitants of Susa, that is, the Elamites, 10 and the rest of the nations that the great and honorable Asenappar took into exile and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest in the region Beyond the River, and now 11 this is a copy of the letter that they sent him.)\n\"To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men of the region Beyond the River: And now 12 let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up here from you to us have arrived at Jerusalem. They are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city, and they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. 13 Now let it be known to the king that if this city should be rebuilt and its walls finished, they will not give tax, tribute, or toll, and it will result in a loss to the treasuries of the kings. 14 Since we eat the salt of the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king's interests harmed, we have therefore sent to make this known to the king, 15 so that there may be an investigation of the book of records of your ancestors. You will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, injurious to kings and provinces, and within it have been those stirring up sedition from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed. 16 We are making known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will have no control of the region Beyond the River.\"\n17 The king sent word to Rehum the chief government official and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues who were dwelling in Samaria and the rest of the region Beyond the River:\n\"Greetings! And now 18 the official document that you sent us has been clearly read before me. 19 By my order an investigation was made, and it was found that from long ago the city has had uprisings against kings, and rebellions and revolts have taken place there. 20 There were powerful kings over Jerusalem who ruled the whole region Beyond the River, and tax, tribute, and toll were paid to them. 21 Now issue an order for these men to stop work, so that the city may not be rebuilt until I issue an order. 22 Be careful not to neglect acting in this regard, so that the king's interests are not harmed any further.\"\n23 Now after the copy of the official document of King Artaxerxes had been read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they quickly went to Jerusalem to the Jews and used force to stop them. 24 It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, came to a halt; and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.\nChapter 5\n1 Then the prophets Haggai and Zechariah the grandson of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them. 2 It was then that Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jehozadak started to rebuild the house of God, which was in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them and supported them. 3 At that time Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and asked them: \"Who issued an order to you to build this house and to finish this structure?\" 4 Then they asked them: \"What are the names of the men who are working on this building?\" 5 But God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report could be sent to Darius and an official document could be sent back concerning this.\n6 Here is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues, the lesser governors of the region Beyond the River, sent to King Darius; 7 they sent the report to him, and this is what they wrote:\n\"To King Darius:\n\"All peace! 8 Let it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah to the house of the great God, and it is being built with large stones rolled into place, and timbers are being laid in the walls. The work is being eagerly done by the people and is making progress through their efforts. 9 Then we questioned their elders, asking them: 'Who issued an order to you to build this house and to finish this structure?' 10 We also asked them their names to inform you, so that we could write the names of the men who are taking the lead.\n11 \"This is the response they gave us: 'We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished. 12 However, because our fathers angered the God of the heavens, he gave them into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who demolished this house and took the people into exile to Babylon. 13 Nevertheless, in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon, King Cyrus issued an order to rebuild this house of God. 14 Moreover, King Cyrus took out of the temple of Babylon the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and had brought to the temple of Babylon. They were given to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom Cyrus made governor. 15 Cyrus said to him: \"Take these vessels. Go, deposit them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its former place.\" 16 Then this Sheshbazzar came, and he laid the foundations of the house of God, which is in Jerusalem; and it has been under construction from then until now, but it has not been completed.'\n17 \"Now if it seems good to the king, let an investigation be made in the royal treasury there in Babylon, to determine whether King Cyrus issued an order to rebuild that house of God in Jerusalem; and let the decision of the king concerning this be sent to us.\"\nChapter 6\n1 It was then that King Darius issued an order, and they made an investigation in the archives where the treasures were deposited in Babylon. 2 And a scroll was found in the citadel at Ecbatana, in the province of Media, and the following memorandum was written on it:\n3 \"In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued an order concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: 'Let the house be rebuilt as the place where they are to offer sacrifices, and its foundations are to be set in place; its height is to be 60 cubits, its width 60 cubits, 4 with three layers of large stones rolled into place and one layer of timbers; and let the expense be paid from the king's house. 5 Also, let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God that Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon be returned, so that they may be put in their place in the temple in Jerusalem and be deposited in the house of God.'\n6 \"So now Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues, the lesser governors of the region Beyond the River-stay away from there. 7 Do not interfere with the work on that house of God. The governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews will rebuild that house of God in its former place. 8 Furthermore, I am issuing an order as to what you are to do for these elders of the Jews for rebuilding that house of God: From the royal treasury, from the tax collected in the region Beyond the River, the expenses are to be promptly given to these men to continue without interruption. 9 And whatever is needed-young bulls as well as rams and lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, just as the priests who are in Jerusalem say-is to be given them continually day by day without fail, 10 so that they may continually present offerings that please the God of the heavens and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 11 I have also issued an order that if anyone violates this decree, a timber will be pulled out of his house and he will be lifted up and fastened to it, and his house will be turned into a public latrine for this offense. 12 And may the God who has caused his name to reside there overthrow any king and people who lift a hand to violate this order and destroy that house of God, which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue this order. Let it be done promptly.\"\n13 Then Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues promptly carried out everything that King Darius had ordered. 14 And the elders of the Jews continued building and making progress, urged on by the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the grandson of Iddo; they finished building it by the order of the God of Israel and by the order of Cyrus and Darius and King Artaxerxes of Persia. 15 They completed the house by the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.\n16 Then the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the former exiles held the inauguration of this house of God with joy. 17 And they presented for the inauguration of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel. 18 And they appointed the priests in their groups and the Levites in their divisions for the service of God in Jerusalem, according to what is written in the book of Moses.\n19 And the former exiles held the Passover on the 14th day of the first month. 20 The priests and the Levites, without exception, had cleansed themselves, so they were all clean; they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice for all the former exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves. 21 Then the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate of it, along with everyone who had joined them and had separated himself from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to worship Jehovah the God of Israel. 22 They also joyfully held the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days, for Jehovah caused them to rejoice and he had made the heart of the king of Assyria favorable toward them, so that he supported them in the work of the house of the true God, the God of Israel.\nChapter 7\n1 After these things, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra returned. He was the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest. 6 This Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a copyist who was well-versed in the Law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given. The king granted everything he requested, for the hand of Jehovah his God was upon him.\n7 Some of the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. 8 And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the king. 9 On the first day of the first month, he began the journey from Babylon, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the good hand of his God was upon him. 10 Ezra had prepared his heart to consult the Law of Jehovah and to practice it, and to teach its regulations and judgments in Israel.\n11 This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and copyist, an expert in the study of the commandments of Jehovah and of his regulations to Israel:\n12 \"Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the copyist of the Law of the God of the heavens: May you have perfect peace. And now 13 I have issued an order that everyone in my realm of the people of Israel and their priests and Levites who is willing to go with you to Jerusalem should go. 14 For you are sent by the king and his seven advisers to investigate whether the Law of your God, which is with you, is being applied in Judah and Jerusalem, 15 and to take the silver and the gold that the king and his advisers have voluntarily given to the God of Israel, whose residence is in Jerusalem, 16 with all the silver and the gold that you receive in all the province of Babylon, along with the gift that the people and the priests voluntarily give to the house of their God, which is in Jerusalem. 17 And you are to buy promptly with this money bulls, rams, lambs, along with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and you are to present them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.\n18 \"And whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do, you may do with the rest of the silver and the gold, according to the will of your God. 19 And all the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, you are to deliver before God at Jerusalem. 20 And the rest of the necessities of the house of your God that you are required to give, you will give out of the royal treasury.\n21 \"I, King Artaxerxes, have issued an order to all the treasurers in the region Beyond the River, that everything that Ezra the priest, the copyist of the Law of the God of the heavens, requests of you is to be done promptly, 22 up to 100 talents of silver, 100 cor measures of wheat, 100 bath measures of wine, 100 bath measures of oil, and salt without limit. 23 Let everything that is ordered by the God of the heavens be done with zeal for the house of the God of the heavens, so that there may be no wrath against the king's realm and his sons. 24 And you are further advised that it is not permitted to impose any tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests and Levites, musicians, doorkeepers, temple servants, and workers of this house of God.\n25 \"And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom that you possess from your God, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the region Beyond the River, all those who know the laws of your God; and you should instruct anyone who does not know them. 26 And everyone who does not observe the Law of your God and the law of the king should have judgment executed on him promptly, whether it is death, banishment, a fine, or imprisonment.\"\n27 May Jehovah the God of our forefathers be praised, who put it into the heart of the king to beautify the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem! 28 And he has shown me loyal love before the king and his advisers and all the mighty princes of the king. So I took courage because the hand of Jehovah my God was upon me, and I gathered out of Israel leading men to go up with me.\nChapter 8\n1 Now these were the heads of their paternal houses and the genealogical enrollment of those who went up with me out of Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes: 2 of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush; 3 of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him there was an enrollment of 150 males; 4 of the sons of Pahath-moab, Elieho-enai the son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 males; 5 of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 males; 6 of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him 50 males; 7 of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him 70 males; 8 of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him 80 males; 9 of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him 218 males; 10 of the sons of Bani, Shelomith the son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 males; 11 of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him 28 males; 12 of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 males; 13 of the sons of Adonikam, those who were the last, and these were their names: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 males; 14 and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them 70 males.\n15 I assembled them at the river that comes to Ahava, and we camped there for three days. But when I examined the people and the priests, I did not find any of the Levites there. 16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were instructors. 17 Then I gave them a command concerning Iddo the leader in the place called Casiphia. I told them to tell Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants who were in Casiphia, to bring to us ministers for the house of our God. 18 Since the good hand of our God was upon us, they brought a discreet man from the sons of Mahli the grandson of Levi the son of Israel, namely, Sherebiah, and his sons and his brothers, 18 men; 19 and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah from the Merarites, his brothers and their sons, 20 men. 20 And there were 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the princes gave to the service of the Levites, all of whom had been designated by name.\n21 Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, to humble ourselves before our God, to seek guidance from him for our journey, for us and for our children and for all our goods. 22 I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemies along the way, because we had said to the king: \"The good hand of our God is over all those seeking him, but his strength and his anger are against all those abandoning him.\" 23 So we fasted and made request of our God concerning this, and he listened to our entreaty.\n24 I now set apart 12 of the chiefs of the priests, namely, Sherebiah and Hashabiah, along with ten of their brothers. 25 Then I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the utensils, the contribution that the king and his advisers and his princes and all the Israelites who were present there had made to the house of our God. 26 Thus I weighed out into their hand 650 talents of silver, 100 silver utensils worth 2 talents, 100 talents of gold, 27 20 small gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and 2 utensils of fine copper, gleaming red, as desirable as gold.\n28 Then I said to them: \"You are holy to Jehovah, and the utensils are holy, and the silver and the gold are a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of your forefathers. 29 Guard them carefully until you weigh them out before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the princes of the paternal houses of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.\" 30 And the priests and the Levites took the silver and the gold and the utensils that had been weighed out to them, in order to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.\n31 Finally we pulled away from the river Ahava on the 12th day of the first month to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our God was over us, and he rescued us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the way. 32 So we came to Jerusalem and stayed there for three days. 33 And on the fourth day, we weighed out the silver and the gold and the utensils in the house of our God and handed them over to Meremoth son of Urijah the priest, and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 34 Everything was numbered and weighed, and all the weight was recorded. 35 Those coming out of the captivity, the former exiles, presented burnt sacrifices to the God of Israel, 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 male lambs, and 12 male goats as a sin offering; all of this was a burnt offering to Jehovah.\n36 Then we gave the decrees of the king to the satraps of the king and the governors of the region Beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of the true God.\nChapter 9\n1 And as soon as these things had been done, the princes approached me and said: \"The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands and their detestable practices, those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 2 They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons. Now they, the holy offspring, have become mingled with the peoples of the lands. The princes and the deputy rulers have been the foremost offenders in this unfaithfulness.\"\n3 Now as soon as I heard of this, I ripped apart my garment and my sleeveless coat and pulled out some of the hair of my head and my beard, and I sat down in shock. 4 Then everyone who had reverence for the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiled people, while I was sitting in shock until the evening grain offering.\n5 And at the time of the evening grain offering, I stood up from my humiliation, with my garment and my sleeveless coat torn apart, and I got down on my knees and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God. 6 And I said: \"O my God, I feel ashamed and embarrassed to raise my face to you, O my God, for our errors have multiplied over our heads and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens. 7 From the days of our forefathers until this day our guilt has been great; and because of our errors, we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to disgrace, as is the case today. 8 But now for a brief moment, favor has come from Jehovah our God by letting a remnant escape and by giving us a secure position in his holy place, to make our eyes shine, O our God, and to revive us a little in our slavery. 9 For although we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our slavery; but he has extended his loyal love toward us before the kings of Persia, to revive us so as to raise up the house of our God and to restore its ruins and to give us a stone wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.\n10 \"But now what can we say, O our God, after this? For we have left your commandments, 11 which you gave us through your servants the prophets, saying: 'The land that you are going in to take possession of is an impure land because of the impurity of the peoples of the lands, because of their detestable practices with which they have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness. 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters to their sons, neither accept their daughters for your sons; and you must never seek their peace and their prosperity, so that you may grow strong and eat the good of the land and take possession of it for your sons forever.' 13 And after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds and our great guilt-for you, O our God, have not dealt with us according to our error, and you have allowed those of us here to escape- 14 are we to break your commandments again and form marriage alliances with the peoples who practice these detestable things? Would you not become so angry with us that you would completely destroy us, leaving no remnant or survivor? 15 O Jehovah the God of Israel, you are righteous, for we have survived as a remnant to this day. Here we are before you in our guilt, for it is impossible to stand before you because of this.\"\nChapter 10\n1 While Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and lying prostrate before the house of the true God, a large crowd of men, women, and children of Israel gathered around him, for the people were weeping profusely. 2 Then Shecaniah the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam said to Ezra: \"We have acted unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples of the land. Despite this, there is still hope for Israel. 3 Now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all the wives and those born from them, in harmony with the direction of Jehovah and of those who have reverence for the commandment of our God. Let us act according to the Law. 4 Get up, for this matter is your responsibility, and we are with you. Be strong and take action.\"\n5 At that Ezra rose and had the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said. So they took an oath. 6 Ezra now got up from before the house of the true God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. Although he went there, he ate no food and drank no water, for he was in mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the exiled people.\n7 Then they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the former exiles gather together at Jerusalem; 8 and according to the decision of the princes and the elders, anyone who did not come within three days' time would have all his goods confiscated, and he would be banished from the congregation of the exiled people. 9 So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem within three days, that is, in the ninth month, on the 20th day of the month. All the people were sitting in a courtyard of the house of the true God, shivering because of the matter at hand and because of the heavy rain.\n10 Then Ezra the priest rose and said to them: \"You have acted unfaithfully by marrying foreign women, and so you have added to the guilt of Israel. 11 Now make confession to Jehovah the God of your forefathers and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from these foreign wives.\" 12 To this the whole congregation answered with a loud voice: \"It is our duty to do exactly as you say. 13 However, there are many people, and it is the rainy season. It is not possible to stand outside, and the matter will not take just one or two days, for we have rebelled extensively in this matter. 14 So, please, let our princes represent the entire congregation; and let all those in our cities who have married foreign women come at an appointed time, along with the elders and judges of each city, until we turn back the burning anger of our God from us concerning this matter.\"\n15 However, Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah objected to this, and the Levites Meshullam and Shabbethai supported them. 16 But the former exiles did what was agreed on; and Ezra the priest and the family heads of their paternal houses, all designated by name, convened separately on the first day of the tenth month to look into the matter; 17 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women. 18 And it was discovered that some of the sons of the priests had married foreign women: of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and his brothers, Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 19 But they promised to send their wives away, and since they were guilty, they would offer a ram of the flock for their guilt.\n20 Of the sons of Immer, there were Hanani and Zebadiah; 21 and of the sons of Harim, Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah; 22 and of the sons of Pashhur, Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Eleasah. 23 And of the Levites, there were Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer; 24 and of the singers, Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers, Shallum, Telem, and Uri.\n25 And of Israel, of the sons of Parosh, there were Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah; 26 and of the sons of Elam, Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah; 27 and of the sons of Zattu, Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza; 28 and of the sons of Bebai, Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai; 29 and of the sons of Bani, Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth; 30 and of the sons of Pahath-moab, Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh; 31 and of the sons of Harim, Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 32 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah; 33 of the sons of Hashum, Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei; 34 of the sons of Bani, Maadai, Amram, Uel, 35 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, 36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 37 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu; 38 and of the sons of Binnui, Shimei, 39 Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 40 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 42 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph; 43 and of the sons of Nebo, Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah. 44 All of these had taken foreign wives, and they sent their wives away, along with their sons. \n",

    "text": "Nehemiah\nChapter 1\n1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah: Now in the month of Chislev, in the 20th year, I was in Shushan the citadel. 2 At that time Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with other men from Judah, and I asked them about the remaining Jews who had escaped the captivity, and also about Jerusalem. 3 They replied: \"Those remaining there in the province who have survived the captivity are in a terrible situation and in disgrace. The walls of Jerusalem are broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.\"\n4 As soon as I heard these words, I sat down and began to weep and mourn for days, and I kept fasting and praying before the God of the heavens. 5 I said: \"O Jehovah, the God of the heavens, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love to those who love him and keep his commandments, 6 please, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to listen to the prayer of your servant that I am praying to you today, day and night, concerning your servants the Israelites, all the while confessing the sins that the people of Israel have committed against you. We have sinned, both I and the house of my father. 7 We have certainly acted corruptly against you by not keeping the commandments, regulations, and judicial decisions that you gave to your servant Moses.\n8 \"Remember, please, the word that you commanded your servant Moses: 'If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples. 9 But if you return to me and observe my commandments and obey them, though your dispersed people should be at the end of the heavens, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen to have my name reside.' 10 They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great power and by your mighty hand. 11 O Jehovah, please, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take delight in fearing your name, and please, grant success to your servant today, and may this man show me compassion.\"\nNow I was cupbearer to the king.\nChapter 2\n1 In the month of Nisan, in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes, wine was set before him, and as usual I took up the wine and gave it to the king. But I had never been gloomy in his presence. 2 So the king said to me: \"Why do you look so gloomy when you are not sick? This can be nothing but gloominess of heart.\" At this I became very frightened.\n3 Then I said to the king: \"Long live the king! Why should I not look gloomy when the city, the place where my forefathers are buried, lies in ruins, and its gates have been consumed by fire?\" 4 The king then said to me: \"What is it that you are seeking?\" At once I prayed to the God of the heavens. 5 I then said to the king: \"If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah, to the city where my forefathers are buried, so that I may rebuild it.\" 6 Then the king, with his royal consort sitting beside him, said to me: \"How long will your journey be, and when will you return?\" So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a set time.\n7 Then I said to the king: \"If it pleases the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the region Beyond the River, granting me safe passage until I reach Judah, 8 as well as a letter to Asaph the keeper of the Royal Park, so that he may give me timber for beams for the gates of the Fortress of the House and for the walls of the city and for the house where I will go.\" So the king gave them to me, for the good hand of my God was upon me.\n9 Eventually I came to the governors of the region Beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. The king also sent with me army chiefs and horsemen. 10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it, they were very displeased that someone had come to do something good for the people of Israel.\n11 At length I came to Jerusalem, and I stayed there for three days. 12 I rose up by night, I and a few men with me, and I did not tell anyone what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem, and there was no animal with me except the one I was riding. 13 And I went out at night through the Valley Gate, passing in front of the Fountain of the Big Snake to the Gate of the Ash Heaps, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been consumed by fire. 14 And I passed along to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, and there was not enough space for the animal I was riding to pass. 15 But I continued up the valley by night, and I kept inspecting the wall, after which I came back and entered through the Valley Gate, and then I returned.\n16 The deputy rulers did not know where I had gone and what I was doing, for I had not yet said anything to the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the deputy rulers, and the rest of the workers. 17 Finally I said to them: \"You can see what a terrible situation we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, so that this disgrace will not continue.\" 18 Then I told them of how the good hand of my God was upon me and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. At this they said: \"Let us get up and build.\" So they strengthened themselves for the good work.\n19 Now when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arabian heard of it, they began to mock us and show us their contempt and say: \"What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?\" 20 However, I replied: \"The God of the heavens is the One who will grant us success, and we his servants will get up and build; but you have neither share nor claim nor memorial in Jerusalem.\"\nChapter 3\n1 Eliashib the high priest and his brothers the priests got up to build the Sheep Gate. They sanctified it and set up its doors; they sanctified it as far as the Tower of Meah, as far as the Tower of Hananel. 2 And next to them the men of Jericho were building; and next to them Zaccur the son of Imri was building.\n3 The sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they timbered it and then set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 4 And next to them Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Hakkoz did repair work, and next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah the son of Meshezabel did repair work, and next to them Zadok the son of Baana did repair work. 5 And next to them the Tekoites did repair work, but their prominent men would not lower themselves to share in the service of their masters.\n6 Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Gate of the Old City; they timbered it and then set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars. 7 Next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite did repair work, men of Gibeon and Mizpah who were under the authority of the governor of the region Beyond the River. 8 Next to them Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, did repair work, and next to him Hananiah, one of the ointment mixers, did repair work; and they paved Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. 9 And next to them Rephaiah the son of Hur, a prince of half the district of Jerusalem, did repair work. 10 And next to them Jedaiah the son of Harumaph did repair work in front of his own house, and next to him Hattush the son of Hashabneiah did repair work.\n11 Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab repaired another section, as well as the Tower of the Ovens. 12 And next to them Shallum the son of Hallohesh, a prince of half the district of Jerusalem, did repair work, along with his daughters.\n13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate; they built it and then set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and they repaired 1,000 cubits of the wall as far as the Gate of the Ash Heaps. 14 Malchijah the son of Rechab, a prince of the district of Beth-haccherem, repaired the Gate of the Ash Heaps; he built it and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars.\n15 Shallun the son of Colhozeh, a prince of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he built it and its roof, set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and also repaired the wall of the Pool of the Canal to the King's Garden and as far as the Stairway that goes down from the City of David.\n16 After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, a prince of half the district of Beth-zur, did repair work from in front of the Burial Places of David as far as the pool that had been built and as far as the House of the Mighty Ones.\n17 After him the Levites did repair work: Rehum the son of Bani; and next to him Hashabiah, a prince of half the district of Keilah, did repair work for his district. 18 After him their brothers did repair work: Bavvai the son of Henadad, a prince of half the district of Keilah.\n19 And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, a prince of Mizpah, was repairing another section in front of the ascent to the Armory at the Buttress.\n20 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai worked with fervor and repaired another section, from the Buttress as far as the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest.\n21 After him Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Hakkoz repaired another section, from the entrance of the house of Eliashib as far as the end of Eliashib's house.\n22 And after him the priests, men of the district of the Jordan, did repair work. 23 After them Benjamin and Hasshub did repair work in front of their own house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah did repair work near his own house. 24 After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah as far as the Buttress and as far as the corner.\n25 After him Palal the son of Uzai did repair work in front of the Buttress and the tower that goes out from the King's House, the upper one that belongs to the Courtyard of the Guard. After him there was Pedaiah the son of Parosh.\n26 And the temple servants who lived in Ophel did repair work as far as in front of the Water Gate on the east and the protruding tower.\n27 After them the Tekoites repaired another section, from in front of the great protruding tower as far as the wall of Ophel.\n28 The priests did repair work above the Horse Gate, each in front of his own house.\n29 After them Zadok the son of Immer did repair work in front of his own house.\nAnd after him Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, did repair work.\n30 After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section.\nAfter him Meshullam the son of Berechiah did repair work in front of his own hall.\n31 After him Malchijah, a member of the goldsmith guild, did repair work as far as the house of the temple servants and the traders, in front of the Inspection Gate and as far as the roof chamber of the corner.\n32 And between the roof chamber of the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the traders did repair work.\nChapter 4\n1 Now as soon as Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and very upset, and he kept mocking the Jews. 2 And in the presence of his brothers and the army of Samaria, he said: \"What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they do this by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish up in a day? Will they bring the charred stones to life out of the heaps of dusty rubble?\"\n3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite, who was standing beside him, said: \"If even a fox would climb up on what they are building, it would knock down their stone wall.\"\n4 Hear, O our God, for we are being treated with contempt, and make their reproach return on their own heads, and give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. 5 And do not cover over their guilt or let their sin be erased from before you, for they have insulted the builders.\n6 So we kept building the wall, and the entire wall was joined together and rebuilt up to half its height, and the people continued to put their heart into the work.\n7 Now as soon as Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being filled in, they became very angry. 8 They conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to create a disturbance in it. 9 But we prayed to our God and kept a guard posted against them day and night.\n10 However, people of Judah were saying: \"The strength of the laborers has failed, and there is so much rubble; we will never be able to build the wall.\"\n11 And our enemies kept saying: \"Before they know it or see us, we will come right in among them and kill them and stop the work.\"\n12 Whenever the Jews living near them came in, they told us again and again: \"They will come at us from all directions.\"\n13 So I kept men posted at the lowest parts of the space behind the wall at the exposed places, and I posted them by families with their swords, their lances, and their bows. 14 When I saw their fear, I immediately rose and said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people: \"Do not be afraid of them. Remember Jehovah, who is great and awe-inspiring; and fight for your brothers, your sons and daughters, your wives and homes.\"\n15 Now after our enemies heard that what they were doing had become known to us and that the true God had frustrated their plan, we all went back to work on the wall. 16 From that day forward, half of my men would do the work and half of them would hold the lances, the shields, the bows, and the coats of mail. And the princes stood behind the whole house of Judah 17 who were building the wall. Those who were carrying the loads did the work with one hand while holding a weapon in the other hand. 18 And each of the builders had a sword strapped to his hip while building, and the one to blow the horn stood beside me.\n19 I then said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people: \"The work is large and extensive, and we are spread out on the wall far apart from one another. 20 When you hear the sound of the horn, gather together to where we are. Our God will fight for us.\"\n21 So we kept working while the other half were holding the lances, from the break of dawn until the stars came out. 22 At that time I said to the people: \"Let the men, each along with his attendant, spend the night inside Jerusalem, and they will guard us by night and work during the day.\" 23 So neither I nor my brothers, my attendants, and the guards who followed me ever took off our garments, and each of us kept his weapon in his right hand.\nChapter 5\n1 However, there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish brothers. 2 Some were saying: \"We are many with our sons and our daughters. We must get grain in order to eat and stay alive.\" 3 Others were saying: \"We are giving our fields and our vineyards and our houses as security to get grain during the food shortage.\" 4 Still others were saying: \"We have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the king's tribute. 5 Now we are of the same flesh and blood as our brothers, and our children are just like their children; yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery, and some of our daughters are already in slavery. But we are powerless to stop this, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others.\"\n6 I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. 7 So I considered these things in my heart, and I took issue with the nobles and the deputy rulers and said to them: \"Each one of you is demanding interest from your own brother.\"\nFurther, I arranged for a great assembly because of them. 8 And I said to them: \"To the extent possible, we have bought back our own Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations; but will you now sell your own brothers, and are they to be sold back to us?\" At this they became speechless, and they could find nothing to say. 9 Then I said: \"What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God so that the nations, our enemies, cannot reproach us? 10 Moreover, I, my brothers, and my attendants are lending them money and grain. Let us, please, stop this lending on interest. 11 Please, restore to them on this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, as well as the hundredth of the money, the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are demanding as interest from them.\"\n12 To this they said: \"We will restore these things to them and ask nothing back. We will do precisely as you say.\" So I called the priests and made those men swear to keep this promise. 13 Also, I shook out the folds of my garment and said: \"In this manner may the true God shake out from his house and from his possessions every man who does not carry out this promise, and in this manner may he be shaken out and emptied.\" To this all the congregation said: \"Amen!\" And they praised Jehovah, and the people did as they promised.\n14 Moreover, from the day that he commissioned me to become their governor in the land of Judah, from the 20th year to the 32nd year of King Artaxerxes, 12 years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance due the governor. 15 But the former governors who were before me had burdened the people and had been taking from them 40 silver shekels for bread and wine each day. Also, their attendants had oppressed the people. But I did not do that because of the fear of God.\n16 Furthermore, I took a hand in the work on this wall, and not a field did we acquire; all my attendants were gathered there for the work. 17 There were 150 Jews and deputy rulers dining at my table, as well as those who came to us from the nations. 18 Every day one bull, six choice sheep, and birds were prepared for me, and once every ten days we had all sorts of wine in abundance. Despite all this I did not demand the food allowance due the governor, because the people were already bearing their burden of service. 19 Do remember me favorably, O my God, for all that I have done in behalf of this people.\nChapter 6\n1 Now as soon as Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies were told that I had rebuilt the wall and that there were no gaps left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), 2 Sanballat and Geshem immediately sent this message to me: \"Come, and let us set a time to meet together in the villages of the Valley Plain of Ono.\" But they were scheming to harm me. 3 So I sent messengers to them, saying: \"I am engaged in a great work, and I am not able to go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come to you?\" 4 They sent me the same message four times, and I gave them the same reply each time.\n5 Then Sanballat sent his attendant to me with the same message a fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. 6 There it was written: \"Among the nations it has been heard, and Geshem is also saying it, that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel. That is why you are building the wall; and according to these reports you are to become their king. 7 Also, you have appointed prophets to proclaim about you throughout Jerusalem, 'There is a king in Judah!' And now these things will be told to the king. So come, and let us discuss this together.\"\n8 However, I sent him this reply: \"None of the things you are saying have taken place; you are making them up out of your own imagination.\" 9 For they were all trying to frighten us, saying: \"Their hands will slacken in the work, and it will not be done.\" Now, I pray, strengthen my hands.\n10 Then I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel while he was confined there. He said: \"Let us set a time to meet at the house of the true God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you by night.\" 11 But I said: \"Should a man like me run away? Can a man like me go into the temple and live? I will not go in!\" 12 Then I realized that God had not sent him, but that Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to speak this prophecy against me. 13 He had been hired to frighten me and to cause me to sin, so that they would have grounds to damage my reputation in order to reproach me.\n14 Do remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat and these deeds, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were constantly trying to frighten me.\n15 So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Elul, in 52 days.\n16 As soon as all our enemies heard of it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they became greatly ashamed, and they realized that it was with our God's help that this work had been done. 17 In those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah would reply to them. 18 Many in Judah swore allegiance to him, for he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 19 Also, they would constantly tell me good things about him and then report to him what I said. Then Tobiah would send letters to frighten me.\nChapter 7\n1 As soon as the wall had been rebuilt I set up the doors; then the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed. 2 I then put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the chief of the Fortress, for he was a most trustworthy man and feared the true God more than many others. 3 So I said to them: \"The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the heat of the day, and while they are standing guard, they should shut the doors and bolt them. And assign the inhabitants of Jerusalem as guards, each to his assigned guardpost and each in front of his own house.\" 4 Now the city was spacious and large, and there were few people inside it, and the houses had not been rebuilt.\n5 But my God put it into my heart to gather together the nobles and the deputy rulers and the people to be enrolled genealogically. Then I found the book of genealogical enrollment of those who first came up, and I found written in it:\n6 And these were the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles, those whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had exiled and who later returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city, 7 those who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.\nThe number of the Israelite men included: 8 the sons of Parosh, 2,172; 9 the sons of Shephatiah, 372; 10 the sons of Arah, 652; 11 the sons of Pahath-moab, of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, 2,818; 12 the sons of Elam, 1,254; 13 the sons of Zattu, 845; 14 the sons of Zaccai, 760; 15 the sons of Binnui, 648; 16 the sons of Bebai, 628; 17 the sons of Azgad, 2,322; 18 the sons of Adonikam, 667; 19 the sons of Bigvai, 2,067; 20 the sons of Adin, 655; 21 the sons of Ater, of Hezekiah, 98; 22 the sons of Hashum, 328; 23 the sons of Bezai, 324; 24 the sons of Hariph, 112; 25 the sons of Gibeon, 95; 26 the men of Bethlehem and Netophah, 188; 27 the men of Anathoth, 128; 28 the men of Beth-azmaveth, 42; 29 the men of Kiriath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, 743; 30 the men of Ramah and Geba, 621; 31 the men of Michmas, 122; 32 the men of Bethel and Ai, 123; 33 the men of the other Nebo, 52; 34 the sons of the other Elam, 1,254; 35 the sons of Harim, 320; 36 the sons of Jericho, 345; 37 the sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, 721; 38 the sons of Senaah, 3,930.\n39 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah of the house of Jeshua, 973; 40 the sons of Immer, 1,052; 41 the sons of Pashhur, 1,247; 42 the sons of Harim, 1,017.\n43 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodevah, 74. 44 The singers: the sons of Asaph, 148. 45 The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, 138.\n46 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth, 47 the sons of Keros, the sons of Sia, the sons of Padon, 48 the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Salmai, 49 the sons of Hanan, the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, 50 the sons of Reaiah, the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, 51 the sons of Gazzam, the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, 52 the sons of Besai, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephushesim, 53 the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur, 54 the sons of Bazlith, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha, 55 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah, 56 the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.\n57 The sons of the servants of Solomon: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Perida, 58 the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel, 59 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Amon. 60 All the temple servants and the sons of the servants of Solomon were 392.\n61 And these went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they were unable to verify their paternal house and their origin, as to whether they were Israelites: 62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642. 63 And of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name. 64 These looked for their records to establish their genealogy, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood. 65 The governor told them that they should not eat from the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim.\n66 The total number of the entire congregation was 42,360, 67 apart from their male and female slaves, who were 7,337; they also had 245 male and female singers. 68 Their horses were 736, their mules 245, 69 their camels 435, their donkeys 6,720.\n70 Some of the heads of the paternal houses contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 gold drachmas, 50 bowls, and 530 priests' robes. 71 And some of the heads of the paternal houses gave to the project treasury 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver minas. 72 And the rest of the people gave 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priests' robes.\n73 And the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all the rest of Israel settled in their cities. When the seventh month arrived, the Israelites had settled in their cities.\nChapter 8\n1 All the people then gathered with one accord at the public square in front of the Water Gate, and they told Ezra the copyist to bring the book of the Law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel. 2 So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the congregation of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month. 3 And he read aloud from it before the public square in front of the Water Gate, from daybreak until midday, to the men, the women, and all who could understand; and the people listened attentively to the book of the Law. 4 And Ezra the copyist was standing on a wooden podium made for the occasion; and standing alongside him on his right were Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.\n5 Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people. As he opened it, all the people stood up. 6 Then Ezra praised Jehovah the true God, the great One, at which all the people answered, \"Amen! Amen!\" and lifted up their hands. They then bowed low and prostrated themselves to Jehovah with their faces to the ground. 7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, who were Levites, were explaining the Law to the people, while the people remained standing. 8 And they continued reading aloud from the book, from the Law of the true God, clearly explaining it and putting meaning into it; so they helped the people to understand what was being read.\n9 And Nehemiah, who was then the governor, Ezra the priest and copyist, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to all the people: \"This day is holy to Jehovah your God. Do not mourn or weep.\" For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the Law. 10 He said to them: \"Go, eat the choice things and drink what is sweet, and send portions of food to those who have nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord, and do not feel sad, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.\" 11 And the Levites were calming all the people, saying: \"Be quiet! for this day is holy, and do not feel sad.\" 12 So all the people went away to eat and to drink and to send out portions of food and to carry on a great rejoicing, for they understood the words that had been made known to them.\n13 And on the second day, the heads of the paternal houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites gathered around Ezra the copyist to gain further insight into the words of the Law. 14 Then they found written in the Law that Jehovah had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should dwell in booths during the festival in the seventh month, 15 and that they should make proclamation and announce throughout all their cities and throughout Jerusalem, saying: \"Go out to the mountainous region and bring in leafy branches from olive trees, pine trees, myrtle and palm trees, and the leafy branches of other trees to make booths, according to what is written.\"\n16 So the people went out and brought them in to make booths for themselves, each one on his roof, as well as in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the house of the true God, in the public square of the Water Gate, and in the public square of the Gate of Ephraim. 17 Thus all those of the congregation who had come back from the captivity made booths and were dwelling in the booths, for the Israelites had not done it this way from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day, so that there was very great rejoicing. 18 And day by day there was a reading from the book of the Law of the true God, from the first day until the last day. And they held the festival for seven days, and there was a solemn assembly on the eighth day, as was required.\nChapter 9\n1 On the 24th day of this month the Israelites assembled; they were fasting with sackcloth and dust on themselves. 2 Those of Israelite descent then separated themselves from all the foreigners, and they stood and confessed their own sins and the errors of their fathers. 3 Then they stood up at their place and read aloud from the book of the Law of Jehovah their God for a fourth of the day; and for another fourth of it they were confessing and bowing down to Jehovah their God.\n4 Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the raised platform of the Levites, and they cried out with a loud voice to Jehovah their God. 5 And the Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said: \"Stand up and praise Jehovah your God throughout all eternity. And let them praise your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.\n6 \"You alone are Jehovah; you made the heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens and all their army, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. And you preserve all of them alive, and the army of the heavens are bowing down to you. 7 You are Jehovah the true God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. 8 You found his heart faithful before you, so you made a covenant with him to give him the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it to his offspring; and you kept your promises, because you are righteous.\n9 \"So you saw the affliction of our forefathers in Egypt, and you heard their outcry at the Red Sea. 10 Then you performed signs and miracles against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted presumptuously against them. You made a name for yourself that remains to this day. 11 And you split the sea before them, so that they crossed through the sea on the dry land, and you hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone thrown into the turbulent waters. 12 You led them by day with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire, to light up for them the way they should go. 13 And you came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven and gave them righteous judgments, laws of truth, good regulations and commandments. 14 You made known to them your holy Sabbath, and you gave them commandments, regulations, and a law through your servant Moses. 15 You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry, and you brought water out of the crag when they were thirsty, and you told them to enter and take possession of the land that you had sworn to give to them.\n16 \"But they, our forefathers, acted presumptuously and became stubborn, and they would not listen to your commandments. 17 They refused to listen, and they did not remember your extraordinary acts that you performed among them, but they became stubborn and appointed a head to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God ready to forgive, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love, and you did not abandon them. 18 Even when they made for themselves a metal statue of a calf and were saying, 'This is your God who led you up out of Egypt,' and they committed great acts of disrespect, 19 even then you, in your great mercy, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night to light up for them the way they should go. 20 And you gave your good spirit to give them insight, and you did not hold back your manna from their mouth, and you gave them water when they were thirsty. 21 For 40 years you provided them with food in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their garments did not wear out, and their feet did not become swollen.\n22 \"You gave them kingdoms and peoples, apportioning them piece by piece, so that they took possession of the land of Sihon, that is, the land of the king of Heshbon, as well as the land of Og the king of Bashan. 23 And you made their sons as numerous as the stars of the heavens. Then you brought them into the land that you had promised their forefathers that they should enter and possess. 24 So their sons went in and took possession of the land, and you subdued before them the Canaanites, who were the inhabitants of the land, and you gave them into their hand, both their kings and the peoples of the land, to do with them as they pleased. 25 And they captured fortified cities and a fertile land, and they took possession of houses full of all sorts of good things, cisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and grew satisfied and fat, and they basked in your great goodness.\n26 \"However, they became disobedient and rebelled against you and turned their back on your Law. They killed your prophets who warned them so as to bring them back to you, and they committed acts of great disrespect. 27 For this you gave them into the hand of their adversaries, who kept causing them distress. But they would cry out to you in the time of their distress, and you would hear from the heavens; and because of your great mercy, you would give them saviors to rescue them out of the hand of their adversaries.\n28 \"But as soon as they had relief, they would again do what is bad before you, and you would abandon them to the hand of their enemies, who would dominate them. Then they would return and call to you for help, and you would hear from the heavens and rescue them time and again because of your great mercy. 29 Although you would warn them so as to bring them back to your Law, they behaved presumptuously and refused to listen to your commandments; and they sinned against your regulations, by which a man will live if he observes them. But they stubbornly turned their back and stiffened their neck, and they refused to listen. 30 You extended patience to them for many years and kept warning them by your spirit through your prophets, but they refused to listen. Finally you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. 31 And in your great mercy, you did not exterminate them or abandon them, for you are a compassionate and merciful God.\n32 \"And now, O our God, the God great, mighty, and awe-inspiring, who has kept his covenant and shown loyal love, do not treat lightly all the hardship that has found us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our forefathers, and all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria down to this day. 33 You have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have acted faithfully; but we are the ones who have acted wickedly. 34 As for our kings, our princes, our priests, and our forefathers, they have not observed your Law nor paid attention to your commandments or to your reminders by which you warned them. 35 Even when they were in their kingdom and enjoying the abundant goodness that you gave them and they were in the broad and fertile land that you bestowed on them, they did not serve you and did not turn away from their bad practices. 36 So here we are today, slaves-yes, slaves in the land that you gave to our forefathers to eat its fruitage and its good things. 37 Its abundant produce is for the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they see fit, and we are in great distress.\n38 \"So in view of all this, we are making a binding agreement in writing, and it is attested by the seal of our princes, our Levites, and our priests.\"\nChapter 10\n1 Those who attested it by putting their seal to it were:\nNehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah,\nAnd Zedekiah, 2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, 4 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, 5 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, 6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 7 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 8 Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah; these are the priests.\n9 Also the Levites: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel, 10 and their brothers Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 11 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 12 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 13 Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.\n14 The heads of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 15 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 17 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 18 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 19 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 20 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 21 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, 22 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, 23 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, 24 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, 25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 26 Ahijah, Hanan, Anan, 27 Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.\n28 The rest of the people-the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, and everyone who separated himself from the peoples of the lands to follow the Law of the true God, along with their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all those with knowledge and understanding- 29 joined their brothers, their prominent men, and bound themselves with a curse and an oath, to walk in the Law of the true God, which had been given through Moses the servant of the true God, and to observe carefully all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, his judgments, and his regulations. 30 We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, and we will not take their daughters for our sons.\n31 If the peoples of the land bring in their wares and every kind of grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we will not buy anything from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day. We will also forgo the produce of the seventh year and every outstanding debt.\n32 Also, we imposed the obligation on ourselves for each of us to give a third of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God, 33 for the layer bread, the regular grain offering, the regular burnt offering of the Sabbaths and the new moons, and for the appointed feasts, for the holy things, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.\n34 Also, we cast lots concerning the supply of the wood that the priests, the Levites, and the people should bring to the house of our God by our paternal houses, at the appointed times, year by year, to burn on the altar of Jehovah our God, according to what is written in the Law. 35 We will also bring the first ripe fruits of our land and the first ripe fruits of every sort of fruit tree, year by year, to the house of Jehovah, 36 as well as the firstborn of our sons and of our livestock-according to what is written in the Law-and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks. We will bring them to the house of our God, to the priests who minister at the house of our God. 37 Also, the firstfruits of our coarse meal, our contributions, the fruitage of every sort of tree, new wine, and oil, we should bring to the priests to the storerooms of the house of our God, along with the tenth from our land to the Levites, for the Levites are the ones who collect the tenths in all our agricultural cities.\n38 And the priest, the son of Aaron, must be with the Levites when the Levites collect the tenth; and the Levites should offer up a tenth of the tenth to the house of our God, to the rooms of the storehouse. 39 For it is to the storerooms that the Israelites and the sons of the Levites should bring the contribution of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and that is where the utensils of the sanctuary are, as well as the priests who minister, the gatekeepers, and the singers. We will not neglect the house of our God.\nChapter 11\n1 Now the princes of the people were living in Jerusalem; but the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine stayed in the other cities. 2 Moreover, the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.\n3 And these are the heads of the province who lived in Jerusalem. (The rest of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, and the sons of the servants of Solomon, lived in the other cities of Judah, each one in his own possession in his city.\n4 Also, there lived in Jerusalem some of the people of Judah and of Benjamin.) Of the people of Judah were Athaiah son of Uzziah son of Zechariah son of Amariah son of Shephatiah son of Mahalalel of the sons of Perez, 5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch son of Colhozeh son of Hazaiah son of Adaiah son of Joiarib son of Zechariah son of the Shelanite. 6 All the sons of Perez who were dwelling in Jerusalem were 468 capable men.\n7 And these were the people of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam son of Joed son of Pedaiah son of Kolaiah son of Maaseiah son of Ithiel son of Jeshaiah, 8 and after him Gabbai and Sallai, 928; 9 and Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second in charge of the city.\n10 Of the priests: Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jachin, 11 Seraiah son of Hilkiah son of Meshullam son of Zadok son of Meraioth son of Ahitub, a leader of the house of the true God, 12 and their brothers who did the work of the house, 822; and Adaiah son of Jeroham son of Pelaliah son of Amzi son of Zechariah son of Pashhur son of Malchijah, 13 and his brothers, heads of paternal houses, 242; and Amashsai son of Azarel son of Ahzai son of Meshillemoth son of Immer, 14 and their brothers who were mighty, courageous men, 128; and their overseer was Zabdiel, a member of a prominent family.\n15 And of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub son of Azrikam son of Hashabiah son of Bunni, 16 and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the heads of the Levites, who were in charge of the outside business of the house of the true God; 17 and Mattaniah, son of Micah son of Zabdi son of Asaph, the conductor of the singing, who led the praises during prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second of his brothers, and Abda son of Shammua son of Galal son of Jeduthun. 18 All the Levites in the holy city were 284.\n19 And the gatekeepers were Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers who kept guard in the gates, 172.\n20 The rest of Israel, the priests, and the Levites were in all the other cities of Judah, each in his own inherited property. 21 The temple servants were living in Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.\n22 The overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani son of Hashabiah son of Mattaniah son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers; he was in charge of the work of the house of the true God. 23 For there was a royal order in their behalf, and there was a fixed provision for the singers as each day required. 24 And Pethahiah son of Meshezabel of the sons of Zerah son of Judah was the king's adviser for every matter of the people.\n25 Regarding the settlements with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba and its dependent towns, in Dibon and its dependent towns, in Jekabzeel and its settlements, 26 in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth-pelet, 27 in Hazar-shual, in Beer-sheba and its dependent towns, 28 in Ziklag, in Meconah and its dependent towns, 29 in En-rimmon, in Zorah, and in Jarmuth, 30 in Zanoah, in Adullam and their settlements, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its dependent towns. They settled from Beer-sheba clear to the Valley of Hinnom.\n31 And the people of Benjamin were in Geba, Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its dependent towns, 32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of the craftsmen. 36 And some divisions of the Levites from Judah were assigned to Benjamin.\nChapter 12\n1 These were the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, 5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, 6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, 7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their brothers in the days of Jeshua.\n8 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who led the songs of thanksgiving along with his brothers. 9 And Bakbukiah and Unni their brothers stood opposite them for guard duties. 10 Jeshua became father to Joiakim, and Joiakim became father to Eliashib, and Eliashib to Joiada. 11 And Joiada became father to Jonathan, and Jonathan became father to Jaddua.\n12 In the days of Joiakim, these were the priests, the heads of the paternal houses: for Seraiah, Meraiah; for Jeremiah, Hananiah; 13 for Ezra, Meshullam; for Amariah, Jehohanan; 14 for Malluchi, Jonathan; for Shebaniah, Joseph; 15 for Harim, Adna; for Meraioth, Helkai; 16 for Iddo, Zechariah; for Ginnethon, Meshullam; 17 for Abijah, Zichri; for Miniamin, ...  ; for Moadiah, Piltai; 18 for Bilgah, Shammua; for Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 19 for Joiarib, Mattenai; for Jedaiah, Uzzi; 20 for Sallai, Kallai; for Amok, Eber; 21 for Hilkiah, Hashabiah; for Jedaiah, Nethanel.\n22 The heads of the paternal houses of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were recorded, as were the priests, down to the kingship of Darius the Persian.\n23 The Levites who were heads of the paternal houses were recorded in the book of the history of the times, down to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 24 The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, and their brothers stood opposite them to offer praise and give thanks according to the instructions of David the man of the true God, guard group corresponding to guard group. 25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were standing guard as gatekeepers, guarding the storerooms by the gates. 26 These served in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and copyist.\n27 At the inauguration of the walls of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites and brought them to Jerusalem from all the places they lived to celebrate the inauguration with rejoicing, with songs of thanksgiving, and with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps. 28 And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district, from all around Jerusalem, from the settlements of the Netophathites, 29 from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built settlements for themselves all around Jerusalem. 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.\n31 Then I brought the princes of Judah up on top of the wall. Further, I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions, and the one walked to the right on the wall toward the Gate of the Ash Heaps. 32 Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah walked behind them, 33 along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. 35 With them were some of the sons of the priests with the trumpets: Zechariah son of Jonathan son of Shemaiah son of Mattaniah son of Micaiah son of Zaccur son of Asaph, 36 and his brothers Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of the true God; and Ezra the copyist went before them. 37 At the Fountain Gate they went straight ahead up the Stairway of the City of David by the ascent of the wall above the House of David and on to the Water Gate to the east.\n38 The other thanksgiving choir walked in the opposite direction, and I followed it with half of the people, on the wall up over the Tower of the Ovens and on to the Broad Wall 39 and up over the Gate of Ephraim and on to the Gate of the Old City and on to the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of Meah, and on to the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at the Gate of the Guard.\n40 At length the two thanksgiving choirs stood before the house of the true God; so did I and half of the deputy rulers with me, 41 and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with the trumpets, 42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loudly under the oversight of Izrahiah.\n43 On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for the true God made them rejoice with great joy. The women and the children also rejoiced, so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away.\n44 On that day men were appointed over the storehouses for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tenths. Into them they were to gather from the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for there was rejoicing in Judah because of the priests and the Levites who were ministering. 45 And they began taking care of the duties of their God and the obligation of the purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the instructions of David and his son Solomon. 46 For long ago in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 47 And during the days of Zerubbabel and during the days of Nehemiah, all Israel gave portions to the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the daily need. They also set aside the portion for the Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.\nChapter 13\n1 On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people, and it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the congregation of the true God, 2 for they had not met the Israelites with bread and water, but instead they had hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God had changed the curse into a blessing. 3 As soon as they heard the Law, they began to separate from Israel all those of foreign descent.\n4 Now before this, the priest in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God was Eliashib, a relative of Tobiah. 5 He had made available for him a large storeroom, where previously they used to put the grain offering, the frankincense, and the utensils and the tenth of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, to which the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers are entitled, along with the contribution for the priests.\n6 And during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for I went to the king in the 32nd year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon; and sometime later I asked the king for a leave of absence. 7 Then I came to Jerusalem and noticed the terrible thing that Eliashib had done in behalf of Tobiah, making a storeroom available for him in the courtyard of the house of the true God. 8 This was very displeasing to me, so I threw all of Tobiah's household furniture out of the storeroom. 9 After that I gave orders, and they cleansed the storerooms; and I put back there the utensils of the house of the true God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.\n10 I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone off, each to his own field. 11 So I reprimanded the deputy rulers and said: \"Why has the house of the true God been neglected?\" Then I gathered them together and assigned them back to their posts. 12 And all Judah brought in the tenth of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storerooms. 13 Then I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the copyist, and Pedaiah of the Levites in charge of the storerooms, and Hanan the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah was their assistant, for these men were considered reliable. It was their responsibility to make the distribution to their brothers.\n14 Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loyal love that I have done for the house of my God and its services.\n15 In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and bringing wine, grapes, figs, and every sort of load into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling provisions on that day. 16 And the Tyrians who lived in the city were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise, selling them to the people of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath. 17 So I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them: \"What is this evil thing that you are doing, even profaning the Sabbath day? 18 Was not this what your forefathers did, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and also on this city? Now you are adding to the burning anger against Israel by profaning the Sabbath.\"\n19 So as soon as the shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered that the doors be closed. I also said that they should not open them until after the Sabbath, and I stationed some of my own attendants at the gates so that no loads would be brought in on the Sabbath day. 20 So the traders and the sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice. 21 Then I warned them and said to them: \"Why are you spending the night in front of the wall? If you do it again, I will use force against you.\" From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.\n22 And I told the Levites that they should regularly purify themselves and come and guard the gates to keep the Sabbath day holy. This, also, do remember to my credit, O my God, and show me pity according to your abundant loyal love.\n23 In those days I also saw Jews who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite, and Moabite women. 24 Half of their sons were speaking Ashdodite and half spoke the language of the different peoples, but none of them knew how to speak the language of the Jews. 25 So I reprimanded them and called down a curse on them and struck some of the men and pulled out their hair and made them swear by God: \"You should not give your daughters to their sons, and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves. 26 Was it not because of these that King Solomon of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him; and he was loved by his God, so that God made him king over all Israel. But the foreign wives caused even him to sin. 27 Is it not something unheard of for you to commit this great evil in acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?\"\n28 One of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest had become a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I drove him away from me.\n29 Do remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.\n30 And I purified them from every foreign defilement, and I assigned duties to the priests and to the Levites, each to his own service, 31 and arranged for the supply of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits.\nDo remember me favorably, O my God. \n",

I will rid myself of my adversaries,\nAnd I will take revenge on my enemies.\n25 I will turn my hand against you,\nI will smelt away your dross as with lye,\nAnd I will remove all your impurities.\n26 I will restore your judges as in the beginning\nAnd your advisers as at the start.\nAfter this you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful Town.\n27 With justice Zion will be redeemed,\nAnd her people who return, with righteousness.\n28 The rebels and the sinners will be broken together,\nAnd those leaving Jehovah will come to their finish.\n29 For they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that you desired,\nAnd you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you chose.\n30 For you will become like a big tree with withering leaves,\nAnd like a garden without water.\n31 The strong man will become tow,\nAnd his work a spark;\nBoth of them will go up in flames together,\nWith no one to extinguish them.\"\nChapter 2\n1 This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:\n2 In the final part of the days,\nThe mountain of the house of Jehovah\nWill become firmly established above the top of the mountains,\nAnd it will be raised up above the hills,\nAnd to it all the nations will stream.\n3 And many peoples will go and say:\n\"Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah,\nTo the house of the God of Jacob.\nHe will instruct us about his ways,\nAnd we will walk in his paths.\"\nFor law will go out of Zion,\nAnd the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.\n4 He will render judgment among the nations\nAnd set matters straight respecting many peoples.\nThey will beat their swords into plowshares\nAnd their spears into pruning shears.\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,\nNor will they learn war anymore.\n5 O house of Jacob, come,\nLet us walk in the light of Jehovah.\n6 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,\nBecause they have become full of things from the East;\nThey practice magic like the Philistines,\nAnd they abound with the children of foreigners.\n7 Their land is filled with silver and gold,\nAnd there is no limit to their treasures.\nTheir land is filled with horses,\nAnd there is no limit to their chariots.\n8 Their land is filled with worthless gods.\nThey bow down to the work of their own hands,\nTo what their own fingers have made.\n9 So man bows down, he becomes low,\nAnd you cannot possibly pardon them.\n10 Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dust\nBecause of the terrifying presence of Jehovah\nAnd his majestic splendor.\n11 The haughty eyes of man will be brought low,\nAnd the arrogance of men will bow down.\nJehovah alone will be exalted in that day.\n12 For it is the day belonging to Jehovah of armies.\nIt is coming upon everyone who is haughty and lofty,\nUpon everyone, whether exalted or lowly,\n13 Upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and exalted\nAnd upon all the oaks of Bashan,\n14 Upon all the lofty mountains\nAnd upon all the high hills,\n15 Upon every high tower and every fortified wall,\n16 Upon all the ships of Tarshish\nAnd upon all desirable boats.\n17 Man's haughtiness will be brought down,\nAnd the arrogance of men will bow low.\nJehovah alone will be exalted in that day.\n18 The worthless gods will completely disappear.\n19 And people will enter into the caves of the rocks\nAnd into the holes in the ground,\nBecause of the terrifying presence of Jehovah\nAnd his majestic splendor,\nWhen he arises to make the earth tremble in terror.\n20 In that day men will take their worthless gods of silver and of gold\nThat they had made for themselves to bow down to\nAnd throw them away to the shrewmice and to the bats,\n21 In order to enter into the holes in the rocks\nAnd into the clefts of the crags,\nBecause of the terrifying presence of Jehovah\nAnd his majestic splendor,\nWhen he arises to make the earth tremble in terror.\n22 For your own sakes, quit trusting in mere man,\nWho is only the breath in his nostrils.\nWhy should he be taken into account?\nChapter 3\n1 For look! the true Lord, Jehovah of armies,\nIs removing from Jerusalem and Judah every kind of support and supply,\nAll support of bread and water,\n2 Mighty man and warrior,\nJudge and prophet, diviner and elder,\n3 Chief of 50, dignitary, and adviser,\nThe expert magician and the skilled charmer.\n4 I will make boys their princes,\nAnd the unstable will rule over them.\n5 The people will oppress one another,\nEach one his fellow man.\nThe boy will assault the old man,\nAnd the lightly esteemed one will defy the respected one.\n6 Each one will take hold of his brother in his father's house and say:\n\"You have a cloak-you be our commander.\nTake charge of this overthrown pile of ruins.\"\n7 But he will protest in that day:\n\"I will not be your wound dresser;\nI have no food or clothing in my house.\nDo not make me commander over the people.\"\n8 For Jerusalem has stumbled,\nAnd Judah has fallen,\nBecause in word and deed they are against Jehovah;\nThey behave defiantly in his glorious presence.\n9 The expression of their faces testifies against them,\nAnd they proclaim their sin like Sodom;\nThey do not try to hide it.\nWoe to them, for they are bringing disaster on themselves!\n10 Tell the righteous that it will go well for them;\nThey will be rewarded for what they do.\n11 Woe to the wicked one!\nDisaster will befall him,\nFor what his hands have done will be done to him!\n12 As for my people, their taskmasters are abusive,\nAnd women rule over them.\nMy people, your leaders are causing you to wander,\nAnd they confuse the direction of your paths.\n13 Jehovah is taking his position to accuse;\nHe is standing up to pass sentence on peoples.\n14 Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders and princes of his people.\n\"You have burned down the vineyard,\nAnd what you have stolen from the poor is in your houses.\n15 How dare you crush my people\nAnd grind the faces of the poor in the dirt?\" declares the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.\n16 Jehovah says: \"Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,\nWalking with their heads high,\nFlirting with their eyes, skipping along,\nMaking a tinkling sound with their anklets,\n17 Jehovah will also strike the head of the daughters of Zion with scabs,\nAnd Jehovah will make their forehead bare.\n18 In that day Jehovah will take away the beauty of their bangles,\nThe headbands and the crescent-shaped ornaments,\n19 The earrings, the bracelets, and the veils,\n20 The headdresses, the ankle chains, and the breastbands,\nThe perfume receptacles and the charms,\n21 The finger rings and the nose rings,\n22 The ceremonial robes, the overtunics, the cloaks, and the purses,\n23 The hand mirrors and the linen garments,\nThe turbans and the veils.\n24 Instead of balsam oil, there will be a rotten smell;\nInstead of a belt, a rope;\nInstead of a beautiful hairstyle, baldness;\nInstead of a rich garment, a garment of sackcloth;\nAnd a brand mark instead of beauty.\n25 By the sword your men will fall,\nAnd your mighty men in battle.\n26 Her entrances will mourn and grieve,\nAnd she will sit on the ground desolate.\"\nChapter 4\n1 And seven women will grab hold of one man in that day, saying:\n\"We will eat our own bread\nAnd wear our own clothing;\nOnly let us be called by your name\nTo take away our disgrace.\"\n2 In that day what Jehovah makes sprout will be splendid and glorious, and the fruitage of the land will be the pride and beauty of the survivors of Israel. 3 Whoever remains in Zion and is left over in Jerusalem will be called holy, all of those in Jerusalem written down for life.\n4 When Jehovah washes away the filth of the daughters of Zion and rinses away the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning, 5 Jehovah will also create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over the place of her conventions a cloud and smoke by day and a bright flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a shelter. 6 And there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain.\nChapter 5\n1 Let me sing, please, to my beloved\nA song about my loved one and his vineyard.\nMy beloved had a vineyard on a fruitful hillside.\n2 He dug it up and rid it of stones.\nHe planted it with a choice red vine,\nBuilt a tower in the middle of it,\nAnd hewed out a winepress in it.\nThen he kept hoping for it to produce grapes,\nBut it produced only wild grapes.\n3 \"And now, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,\nPlease judge between me and my vineyard.\n4 What more could I have done for my vineyard\nThat I have not already done?\nWhy, when I hoped for grapes,\nDid it produce only wild grapes?\n5 Now, please, let me tell you\nWhat I will do to my vineyard:\nI will remove its hedge,\nAnd it will be burned down.\nI will break down its stone wall,\nAnd it will be trampled on.\n6 I will make it a wasteland;\nIt will not be pruned or hoed.\nIt will be overgrown with thornbushes and weeds,\nAnd I will command the clouds not to send any rain on it.\n7 For the vineyard of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel;\nThe men of Judah are the plantation he was fond of.\nHe kept hoping for justice,\nBut look! there was injustice;\nFor righteousness,\nBut look! a cry of distress.\"\n8 Woe to those who join one house to another house\nAnd who annex one field to another field\nUntil there is no more room\nAnd you live by yourselves on the land!\n9 Jehovah of armies has sworn in my ears\nThat many houses, though great and beautiful,\nWill become an object of horror,\nWithout an inhabitant.\n10 For ten acres of vineyard will produce but one bath measure,\nAnd a homer measure of seed will produce only an ephah.\n11 Woe to those who get up early in the morning to drink alcohol,\nWho linger late into the evening darkness until wine inflames them!\n12 They have harp and stringed instrument,\nTambourine, flute, and wine at their feasts;\nBut they do not consider the activity of Jehovah,\nAnd they do not see the work of his hands.\n13 So my people will go into exile\nFor lack of knowledge;\nTheir glorious men will go hungry,\nAnd all their people will be parched with thirst.\n14 So the Grave has enlarged itself\nAnd has opened its mouth wide without limit;\nAnd her splendor, her noisy multitudes, and her revelers\nWill certainly go down into it.\n15 And man will bow down,\nMan will be brought low,\nAnd the eyes of the haughty will be brought low.\n16 Jehovah of armies will be exalted by his judgment;\nThe true God, the Holy One, will sanctify himself through righteousness.\n17 And the lambs will graze as in their pasture;\nForeign residents will feed on the desolate places of well-fed animals.\n18 Woe to those who drag along their guilt with ropes of deception\nAnd their sin with wagon cords;\n19 Those who say: \"Let Him speed up his work;\nLet it come quickly that we may see it.\nLet the purpose of the Holy One of Israel take place\nThat we may know it!\"\n20 Woe to those who say that good is bad and bad is good,\nThose who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness,\nThose who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!\n21 Woe to those wise in their own eyes\nAnd discreet in their own sight!\n22 Woe to those who are mighty in drinking wine\nAnd to the men who are masters at mixing alcoholic drinks,\n23 Those who acquit the wicked for a bribe\nAnd who deny justice to the righteous!\n24 Therefore, just as the tongue of fire consumes the stubble\nAnd dry grass shrivels in the flames,\nTheir very roots will rot,\nAnd their blossoms will scatter like powder,\nBecause they rejected the law of Jehovah of armies\nAnd disrespected the word of the Holy One of Israel.\n25 That is why the anger of Jehovah burns against his people,\nAnd he will stretch out his hand against them and strike them.\nThe mountains will quake,\nAnd their corpses will be like refuse in the streets.\nIn view of all this, his anger has not turned back,\nBut his hand is still stretched out to strike.\n26 He has raised up a signal to a distant nation;\nHe has whistled for them to come from the ends of the earth;\nAnd look! they are coming very swiftly.\n27 None among them are tired or stumbling.\nNo one is drowsy or sleeps.\nThe belt around their waist is not loosened,\nNor are their sandal laces broken.\n28 All their arrows are sharp,\nAnd all their bows are bent.\nThe hooves of their horses are like flint,\nAnd their wheels like a storm wind.\n29 Their roaring is like that of a lion;\nThey roar like young lions.\nThey will growl and seize the prey\nAnd carry it off with no one to rescue it.\n30 In that day they will growl over it\nLike the growling of the sea.\nAnyone who gazes at the land will see distressing darkness;\nEven the light has grown dark because of the clouds.\nChapter 6\n1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw Jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne, and the skirts of his robe filled the temple. 2 Seraphs were standing above him; each had six wings. Each covered his face with two and covered his feet with two, and each of them would fly about with two.\n3 And one called to the other:\n\"Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies.\nThe whole earth is filled with his glory.\"\n4 And the pivots of the thresholds quivered at the sound of the shouting, and the house was filled with smoke.\n5 Then I said: \"Woe to me!\nI am as good as dead,\nFor I am a man of unclean lips,\nAnd I live among a people of unclean lips;\nFor my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of armies himself!\"\n6 At that, one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. 7 He touched my mouth and said:\n\"Look! This has touched your lips.\nYour guilt is removed,\nAnd your sin is atoned for.\"\n8 Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying: \"Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?\" And I said: \"Here I am! Send me!\"\n9 And he replied, \"Go, and say to this people:\n'You will hear again and again,\nBut you will not understand;\nYou will see again and again,\nBut you will not get any knowledge.'\n10 Make the heart of this people unreceptive,\nMake their ears unresponsive,\nAnd paste their eyes together,\nSo that they may not see with their eyes\nAnd hear with their ears,\nSo that their heart may not understand\nAnd they may not turn back and be healed.\"\n11 At this I said: \"How long, O Jehovah?\" Then he said:\n\"Until the cities crash in ruins without an inhabitant\nAnd the houses are without people\nAnd the land is ruined and desolate;\n12 Until Jehovah removes men far away\nAnd the deserted condition of the land becomes very extensive.\n13 \"But there will still be a tenth in it, and it will again be burned, like a big tree and like an oak, which after they are cut down leave a stump; a holy seed will be its stump.\"\nChapter 7\n1 Now in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, the king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, came up to wage war against Jerusalem, but he could not capture it. 2 A report was made to the house of David: \"Syria has joined forces with Ephraim.\"\nAnd the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people began to tremble, like the trees of the forest shaking in the wind.\n3 Jehovah then said to Isaiah: \"Go out, please, to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool by the highway of the laundryman's field. 4 You must say to him, 'Take care to stay calm. Do not be afraid, and do not lose heart because of these two stumps of smoldering logs, because of the hot anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah. 5 For Syria with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have plotted harm against you, saying: 6 \"Let us go up against Judah and tear it apart and conquer it for ourselves, and let us appoint the son of Tabeel as its king.\"\n7 \"'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n\"It will not succeed,\nNor will it take place.\n8 For the head of Syria is Damascus,\nAnd the head of Damascus is Rezin.\nWithin just 65 years\nEphraim will be completely shattered and cease to be a people.\n9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria,\nAnd the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.\nUnless you have firm faith,\nYou will not be firmly established.\"'\"\n10 Jehovah continued speaking to Ahaz: 11 \"Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; it may be as deep as the Grave or as high as the sky.\" 12 But Ahaz said: \"I will not ask, nor will I put Jehovah to the test.\"\n13 Isaiah then said: \"Listen, please, O house of David. Is it not enough that you try the patience of men? Must you also try the patience of God? 14 Therefore, Jehovah himself will give you a sign: Look! The young woman will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel. 15 He will eat butter and honey by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good. 16 For before the boy knows how to reject the bad and choose the good, the land of the two kings whom you dread will be completely abandoned. 17 Jehovah will bring against you and against your people and against the house of your father a time such as has not come since the day Ephraim broke away from Judah, for He will bring the king of Assyria.\n18 \"In that day Jehovah will whistle for the flies from the distant streams of the Nile of Egypt and for the bees in the land of Assyria, 19 and they will all come and settle down on the steep valleys, on the rocky clefts, on all the thornbushes, and on all the watering places.\n20 \"In that day by means of a hired razor from the region of the River, by means of the king of Assyria, Jehovah will shave the head and the hair of the legs, and it will sweep away the beard as well.\n21 \"In that day a man will keep alive a young cow of the herd and two sheep. 22 And because of the abundance of milk, he will eat butter, for everyone remaining in the land will eat butter and honey.\n23 \"In that day wherever there used to be 1,000 vines worth 1,000 pieces of silver, there will be only thornbushes and weeds. 24 Men will go there with bow and arrow, because all the land will become thornbushes and weeds. 25 And all the mountains that used to be cleared with a hoe, you will not go near for fear of thornbushes and weeds; they will become a grazing place for bulls and a trampling ground of sheep.\"\nChapter 8\n1 Jehovah said to me: \"Take a large tablet and write on it with an ordinary stylus, 'Maher-shalal-hash-baz.' 2 And let me have it confirmed in writing by faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.\"\n3 Then I had relations with the prophetess, and she became pregnant and in time gave birth to a son. Jehovah then said to me: \"Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz, 4 for before the boy knows how to call out, 'My father!' and 'My mother!' the resources of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.\"\n5 Jehovah spoke to me again:\n6 \"Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of the Shiloah\nAnd they rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,\n7 Therefore look! Jehovah will bring against them\nThe mighty and vast waters of the River,\nThe king of Assyria and all his glory.\nHe will come up over all his streambeds\nAnd overflow all his banks\n8 And sweep through Judah.\nHe will flood and pass through, reaching to the neck;\nHis outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land,\nO Immanuel!\"\n9 Cause harm, you peoples, but you will be shattered to pieces.\nListen, all you from distant parts of the earth!\nPrepare for battle, but you will be shattered to pieces!\nPrepare for battle, but you will be shattered to pieces!\n10 Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted!\nSay what you like, but it will not succeed,\nFor God is with us!\n11 With his strong hand on me, this is what Jehovah said to me to warn me away from following the course of this people:\n12 \"You should not call a conspiracy what this people calls a conspiracy!\nDo not fear what they fear;\nDo not tremble at it.\n13 Jehovah of armies-he is the One you should regard as holy,\nHe is the One you should fear,\nAnd he is the One who should cause you to tremble.\"\n14 He will become as a sanctuary,\nBut as a stone to strike against\nAnd as a rock to stumble over\nTo both houses of Israel,\nAs a trap and a snare\nTo the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n15 Many of them will stumble and fall and be broken;\nThey will be ensnared and caught.\n16 Wrap up the written confirmation;\nSeal up the law among my disciples!\n17 I will keep in expectation of Jehovah, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.\n18 Look! I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are as signs and as miracles in Israel from Jehovah of armies, who resides on Mount Zion.\n19 And if they say to you: \"Inquire of the spirit mediums or of the fortune-tellers who chirp and mutter,\" is it not of their God that a people should inquire? Should they inquire of the dead in behalf of the living? 20 Instead, they should inquire of the law and of the written confirmation!\nWhen they do not speak according to this word, they have no light. 21 And each one will pass through the land afflicted and hungry; and because he is hungry and indignant, he will curse his king and his God as he looks upward. 22 Then he will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness, obscurity and hard times, gloom and no brightness.\nChapter 9\n1 However, the gloom will not be as when the land had distress, as in former times when the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali were treated with contempt. But at a later time He will cause it to be honored-the way by the sea, in the region of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.\n2 The people who were walking in the darkness\nHave seen a great light.\nAs for those dwelling in the land of deep shadow,\nLight has shone on them.\n3 You have made the nation populous;\nYou have made its rejoicing great.\nThey rejoice before you\nAs people rejoice in the harvesttime,\nAs those who joyfully divide up the spoil.\n4 For you have shattered to pieces the yoke of their load,\nThe rod on their shoulders, the staff of the taskmaster,\nAs in the day of Midian.\n5 Every boot that shakes the earth as it marches\nAnd every garment soaked in blood\nWill become fuel for the fire.\n6 For a child has been born to us,\nA son has been given to us;\nAnd the rulership will rest on his shoulder.\nHis name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.\n7 To the increase of his rulership\nAnd to peace, there will be no end,\nOn the throne of David and on his kingdom\nIn order to establish it firmly and to sustain it\nThrough justice and righteousness,\nFrom now on and forever.\nThe zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.\n8 Jehovah sent a word against Jacob,\nAnd it has come against Israel.\n9 And all the people will know it\n-Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria-\nWho say in their haughtiness and in their insolence of heart:\n10 \"Bricks have fallen,\nBut we will build with hewn stone.\nSycamore trees have been cut down,\nBut we will replace them with cedars.\"\n11 Jehovah will raise up Rezin's adversaries against him\nAnd will stir his enemies to action,\n12 Syria from the east and the Philistines from the west,\nThey will devour Israel with open mouths.\nIn view of all this, his anger has not turned back,\nBut his hand is still stretched out to strike.\n13 For the people have not returned to the One who strikes them;\nThey have not sought Jehovah of armies.\n14 Jehovah will cut off from Israel\nHead and tail, shoot and rush, in one day.\n15 The elder and highly respected one is the head,\nAnd the prophet giving false instruction is the tail.\n16 Those leading this people are causing them to wander,\nAnd those who are being led are confused.\n17 That is why Jehovah will not rejoice over their young men,\nAnd he will have no mercy on their fatherless children and their widows\nBecause all of them are apostates and evildoers\nAnd every mouth is speaking senselessness.\nIn view of all this, his anger has not turned back,\nBut his hand is still stretched out to strike.\n18 For wickedness burns like a fire,\nConsuming thornbushes and weeds.\nIt will set fire to the thickets of the forest,\nAnd they will go up in clouds of smoke.\n19 In the fury of Jehovah of armies\nThe land has been set on fire,\nAnd the people will become fuel for the fire.\nNo one will spare even his brother.\n20 One will cut down on the right\nBut still be hungry;\nAnd one will eat on the left\nBut will not be satisfied.\nEach will devour the flesh of his own arm,\n21 Manasseh will devour Ephraim,\nAnd Ephraim Manasseh.\nTogether they will be against Judah.\nIn view of all this, his anger has not turned back,\nBut his hand is still stretched out to strike.\nChapter 10\n1 Woe to those who enact harmful regulations,\nWho constantly draft oppressive decrees,\n2 To deny the legal claim of the poor,\nTo deprive the lowly among my people of justice,\nMaking widows their spoil\nAnd fatherless children their plunder!\n3 What will you do on the day of reckoning,\nWhen destruction comes from afar?\nTo whom will you flee for assistance,\nAnd where will you leave your wealth?\n4 Nothing remains except to crouch among the prisoners\nOr to fall among the slain.\nIn view of all this, his anger has not turned back,\nBut his hand is still stretched out to strike.\n5 \"Aha! the Assyrian,\nThe rod to express my anger\nAnd the staff in their hand for my denunciation!\n6 I will send him against an apostate nation,\nAgainst the people who infuriated me;\nI will command him to take much spoil and much plunder\nAnd to trample them like mud in the streets.\n7 But he will not be inclined this way\nAnd his heart will not scheme this way;\nFor it is in his heart to annihilate,\nTo cut off many nations, not a few.\n8 For he says,\n'Are not my princes all kings?\n9 Is not Calno just like Carchemish?\nIs not Hamath like Arpad?\nIs not Samaria like Damascus?\n10 My hand has seized the kingdoms of the worthless gods,\nWhose graven images were more than those of Jerusalem and Samaria!\n11 Will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols\nJust as I have done to Samaria and to her worthless gods?'\n12 \"When Jehovah finishes all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, He will punish the king of Assyria for his insolent heart and his proud, arrogant gaze. 13 For he says,\n'I will do this by the strength of my hand\nAnd with my wisdom, for I am wise.\nI will remove the boundaries of peoples\nAnd pillage their treasures,\nAnd I will subdue the inhabitants like a mighty one.\n14 Like a man reaching into a nest,\nMy hand will seize the resources of the peoples;\nAnd like one gathering abandoned eggs,\nI will gather the whole earth!\nNo one will flutter his wings or open his mouth or chirp.'\"\n15 Will the ax exalt itself over the one who chops with it?\nWill the saw exalt itself over the one who saws with it?\nCould a staff wave the one who lifts it?\nOr could a rod lift up the one who is not made of wood?\n16 Therefore the true Lord, Jehovah of armies,\nWill inflict emaciation on his fat ones,\nAnd beneath his glory he will kindle a blazing fire.\n17 Israel's Light will become a fire,\nAnd his Holy One a flame;\nIt will blaze up and consume his weeds and his thornbushes in one day.\n18 He will utterly do away with the glory of his forest and his orchard;\nIt will be as when a sick man wastes away.\n19 The rest of the trees of his forest\nWill be so few that a boy could list them.\n20 In that day those remaining of Israel\nAnd the survivors of the house of Jacob\nWill no longer support themselves on the one who struck them;\nBut they will support themselves on Jehovah,\nThe Holy One of Israel, with faithfulness.\n21 Only a remnant will return,\nThe remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God.\n22 For though your people, O Israel,\nAre as the grains of sand of the sea,\nOnly a remnant of them will return.\nAn extermination has been decided on,\nAnd justice will engulf them.\n23 Yes, the extermination decided on by the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,\nWill be carried out in the entire land.\n24 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, says: \"Do not be afraid, my people who are dwelling in Zion, because of the Assyrian, who used to strike you with the rod and to lift up his staff against you as Egypt did. 25 For in a very little while the denunciation will come to an end; my anger will be directed to their destruction. 26 Jehovah of armies will brandish a whip against him, as when he defeated Midian by the rock Oreb.

Then Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt will serve God together with Assyria. 24 In that day Israel will be the third along with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, 25 for Jehovah of armies will have blessed it, saying: \"Blessed be my people, Egypt, and the work of my hands, Assyria, and my inheritance, Israel.\"\nChapter 20\n1 In the year that King Sargon of Assyria sent the Tartan to Ashdod, he fought against Ashdod and captured it. 2 At that time Jehovah spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying: \"Go, remove the sackcloth from your hips, and take your sandals off your feet.\" And he did so, walking about naked and barefoot.\n3 Jehovah then said: \"Just as my servant Isaiah has walked about naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Ethiopia, 4 so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, boys and old men, naked and barefoot and with exposed buttocks, the nakedness of Egypt. 5 And they will be terrified and will be ashamed of Ethiopia their hope and of Egypt their pride. 6 The inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, 'Look at what happened to our hope, to which we fled for help and rescue from the king of Assyria! How will we escape now?'\"\nChapter 21\n1 A pronouncement against the wilderness of the sea:\nIt is coming like storm winds that sweep through in the south,\nFrom the wilderness, from a fearsome land.\n2 A harsh vision has been told to me:\nThe treacherous one is acting treacherously,\nAnd the destroyer is destroying.\nGo up, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media!\nI will put an end to all the sighing she caused.\n3 That is why I am in great anguish.\nConvulsions have seized me,\nLike those of a woman giving birth.\nI am too distressed to hear;\nI am too disturbed to see.\n4 My heart falters; I shudder in terror.\nThe twilight I longed for makes me tremble.\n5 Set the table and arrange the seats!\nEat and drink!\nGet up, you princes, anoint the shield!\n6 For this is what Jehovah said to me:\n\"Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.\"\n7 And he saw a war chariot with a team of horses,\nA war chariot of donkeys,\nA war chariot of camels.\nHe watched carefully, with great attentiveness.\n8 Then he called out like a lion:\n\"Upon the watchtower, O Jehovah, I am standing constantly by day,\nAnd I am stationed at my guardpost every night.\n9 Look at what is coming:\nMen in a war chariot with a team of horses!\"\nThen he spoke up and said:\n\"She has fallen! Babylon has fallen!\nAll the graven images of her gods he has shattered to the ground!\"\n10 O my people who have been threshed,\nThe product of my threshing floor,\nI have reported to you what I have heard from Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel.\n11 A pronouncement against Dumah:\nSomeone is calling out to me from Seir:\n\"Watchman, what of the night?\nWatchman, what of the night?\"\n12 The watchman said:\n\"The morning is coming, and also the night.\nIf you would inquire, inquire.\nCome again!\"\n13 A pronouncement against the desert plain:\nIn the forest in the desert plain you will spend the night,\nO caravans of Dedan.\n14 Bring water to meet the thirsty one,\nYou inhabitants of the land of Tema,\nAnd bring bread for the one fleeing.\n15 For they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword,\nFrom the bent bow, and from the cruelty of the war.\n16 For this is what Jehovah said to me: \"Within one year, like the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end. 17 The remaining bowmen of the warriors of Kedar will be few, for Jehovah the God of Israel has spoken.\"\nChapter 22\n1 A pronouncement about the Valley of Vision:\nWhat is the matter with you that you have all gone up to the roofs?\n2 You were full of turmoil,\nA boisterous city, an exultant town.\nYour slain were not slain with the sword,\nNor did they die in battle.\n3 All your dictators have fled together.\nThey were taken prisoner without need of a bow.\nAll who were found were taken prisoner,\nEven though they had fled far away.\n4 That is why I said: \"Turn your eyes away from me,\nAnd I will weep bitterly.\nDo not insist on comforting me\nOver the destruction of the daughter of my people.\n5 For it is a day of confusion and of defeat and of panic,\nFrom the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,\nIn the Valley of Vision.\nThere is a demolishing of the wall\nAnd a cry to the mountain.\n6 Elam picks up the quiver\nWith manned chariots and horses,\nAnd Kir uncovers the shield.\n7 Your choicest valleys\nWill become full of war chariots,\nAnd the horses will take their positions at the gate,\n8 And the screen of Judah will be removed.\n\"In that day you will look toward the armory of the House of the Forest, 9 and you will see the many breaches of the City of David. And you will collect the waters of the lower pool. 10 You will count the houses of Jerusalem, and you will pull down the houses to reinforce the wall. 11 And you will make a basin between the two walls for the water of the old pool, but you will not look to its Grand Maker, and you will not see the One who formed it long ago.\n12 In that day the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,\nWill call for weeping and mourning,\nFor shaved heads and the wearing of sackcloth.\n13 But instead, there is celebration and rejoicing,\nThe killing of cattle and the slaughtering of sheep,\nThe eating of meat and the drinking of wine.\n'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.'\"\n14 Then Jehovah of armies revealed himself in my ears: \"'This error will not be atoned in your behalf until you people die,' says the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.\"\n15 This is what the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, says: \"Go in to this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the house, and say, 16 'What is your interest here, and who is there of interest to you here, that you hewed out a burial place here for yourself?' He is hewing out his burial place in a high place; he is cutting out a resting-place for himself in a crag. 17 'Look! Jehovah will hurl you down violently, O man, and seize you forcibly. 18 He will certainly wrap you up tightly and hurl you like a ball into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will be, a disgrace to your master's house. 19 And I will depose you from your position and throw you out of your office.\n20 \"'In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 21 and I will clothe him with your robe and firmly bind your sash around him, and I will give your authority into his hand. And he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 22 And I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder. He will open and no one will shut; and he will shut and no one will open. 23 I will drive him in as a peg in a lasting place, and he will become as a throne of glory to the house of his father. 24 And they will hang on him all the glory of the house of his father, the descendants and the offspring, all the small vessels, the bowl-shaped vessels, as well as all the large jars.\n25 \"'In that day,' declares Jehovah of armies, 'the peg that is driven in a lasting place will be removed, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that it supported will fall to ruin, for Jehovah himself has spoken.'\"\nChapter 23\n1 A pronouncement about Tyre:\nWail, you ships of Tarshish!\nFor the port has been destroyed; it cannot be entered.\nFrom the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them.\n2 Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland.\nThe merchants from Sidon who cross the sea have filled you.\n3 Over many waters went the grain of Shihor,\nThe harvest of the Nile, her revenue,\nBringing the profit of the nations.\n4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, you stronghold of the sea,\nBecause the sea has said:\n\"I have not had birth pains, and I have not given birth,\nNor have I brought up young men or raised young women.\"\n5 As when they heard the report about Egypt,\nPeople will be in anguish over the report about Tyre.\n6 Cross over to Tarshish!\nWail, you inhabitants of the coastland!\n7 Is this your city that was exultant from long ago, from her early times?\nHer feet used to take her to distant lands to reside.\n8 Who has decided this against Tyre,\nThe bestower of crowns,\nWhose merchants were princes,\nWhose tradesmen were honored in all the earth?\n9 Jehovah of armies himself has decided this,\nTo profane her pride over all her beauty,\nTo humiliate all those who were honored throughout the earth.\n10 Cross over your land like the Nile River, O daughter of Tarshish.\nThere is no longer any shipyard.\n11 He has stretched his hand out over the sea;\nHe has shaken kingdoms.\nJehovah has ordered the annihilation of Phoenicia's strongholds.\n12 And he says: \"You will exult no more,\nO oppressed one, the virgin daughter of Sidon.\nGet up, cross over to Kittim.\nEven there you will find no rest.\"\n13 Look! The land of the Chaldeans.\nThis is the people-Assyria was not the one-\nThey made her a place for those haunting the desert.\nThey have erected their siege towers;\nThey have stripped bare her fortified towers,\nReducing her to a crumbling ruin.\n14 Wail, you ships of Tarshish,\nFor your stronghold has been destroyed.\n15 In that day Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, the same as the lifetime of one king. At the end of 70 years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of a prostitute:\n16 \"Take a harp, go around the city, O forgotten prostitute.\nPlay your harp skillfully;\nSing many songs,\nSo that they will remember you.\"\n17 At the end of 70 years, Jehovah will turn his attention to Tyre, and she will return to her hire and prostitute herself with all the world's kingdoms on the face of the earth. 18 But her profit and her hire will become something holy to Jehovah. It will not be stored or laid away, because her hire will be for those dwelling before Jehovah, so that they may eat to satisfaction and wear elegant clothing.\nChapter 24\n1 Look! Jehovah is emptying the land and making it desolate.\nHe turns it upside down and scatters its inhabitants.\n2 It will be the same for everyone:\nThe people as well as the priest,\nThe servant and his master,\nThe servant and her mistress,\nThe buyer and the seller,\nThe lender and the borrower,\nThe creditor and the debtor.\n3 The land will be completely emptied;\nIt will be completely plundered,\nFor Jehovah has spoken this word.\n4 The land mourns; it is wasting away.\nThe productive land withers; it is fading away.\nThe prominent people of the land wither.\n5 The land has been polluted by its inhabitants,\nFor they have bypassed the laws,\nChanged the regulation,\nAnd broken the lasting covenant.\n6 That is why the curse devours the land,\nAnd those inhabiting it are held guilty.\nThat is why the inhabitants of the land have dwindled,\nAnd very few men are left.\n7 The new wine mourns, the vine withers,\nAnd all those cheerful at heart are sighing.\n8 The joy of the tambourines has ceased;\nThe noise of the revelers has ended;\nThe happy sound of the harp has ceased.\n9 They drink wine without song,\nAnd alcohol tastes bitter to those drinking it.\n10 The deserted town is broken down;\nEvery house is shut up so that no one can enter.\n11 They cry out for wine in the streets.\nAll rejoicing has disappeared;\nThe joy of the land has gone.\n12 The city is left in ruins;\nThe gate has been crushed to a heap of rubble.\n13 For this is how it will be in the land, among the peoples:\nAs when an olive tree is beaten,\nLike the gleaning when the grape harvest comes to an end.\n14 They will raise their voice,\nThey will shout joyfully.\nFrom the sea they will proclaim the majesty of Jehovah.\n15 That is why they will glorify Jehovah in the region of light;\nIn the islands of the sea they will glorify the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.\n16 From the ends of the earth we hear songs:\n\"Glory to the Righteous One!\"\nBut I say: \"I am wasting away, I am wasting away!\nWoe to me! The treacherous have acted treacherously;\nWith treachery the treacherous have acted treacherously.\"\n17 Terror and pits and traps await you, inhabitant of the land.\n18 Anyone fleeing from the sound of terror will fall into the pit,\nAnd anyone coming up from the pit will be caught in the trap.\nFor the floodgates above will be opened,\nAnd the foundations of the land will quake.\n19 The land has burst apart;\nThe land has been shaken up;\nThe land convulses violently.\n20 The land staggers like a drunken man,\nAnd it sways back and forth like a hut in the wind.\nIts transgression weighs heavily on it,\nAnd it will fall, so that it will not rise up again.\n21 In that day Jehovah will turn his attention to the army of the heights above\nAnd to the kings of the earth upon the earth.\n22 And they will be gathered together\nLike prisoners gathered into a pit,\nAnd they will be shut up in the dungeon;\nAfter many days they will be given attention.\n23 The full moon will be abashed,\nAnd the shining sun will be ashamed,\nFor Jehovah of armies has become King in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,\nGlorious before the elders of his people.\nChapter 25\n1 O Jehovah, you are my God.\nI exalt you, I praise your name,\nFor you have done wonderful things,\nThings purposed from ancient times,\nIn faithfulness, in trustworthiness.\n2 For you have turned a city into a pile of stones,\nA fortified town into a crumbling ruin.\nThe foreigner's tower is a city no more;\nIt will never be rebuilt.\n3 That is why a strong people will glorify you;\nThe city of tyrannical nations will fear you.\n4 For you have become a stronghold to the lowly,\nA stronghold to the poor in his distress,\nA refuge from the rainstorm,\nAnd a shade from the heat.\nWhen the blast of the tyrants is like a rainstorm against a wall,\n5 As the heat in a parched land,\nYou subdue the uproar of strangers.\nLike heat that is subdued by the shadow of a cloud,\nSo the song of the tyrants is silenced.\n6 In this mountain Jehovah of armies will make for all the peoples\nA banquet of rich dishes,\nA banquet of fine wine,\nOf rich dishes filled with marrow,\nOf fine, filtered wine.\n7 In this mountain he will do away with the shroud that is enveloping all the peoples\nAnd the covering that is woven over all the nations.\n8 He will swallow up death forever,\nAnd the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.\nThe reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth,\nFor Jehovah himself has spoken it.\n9 In that day they will say:\n\"Look! This is our God!\nWe have hoped in him,\nAnd he will save us.\nThis is Jehovah!\nWe have hoped in him.\nLet us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him.\"\n10 For the hand of Jehovah will rest on this mountain,\nAnd Moab will be trampled on in its place\nLike straw trampled into a pile of manure.\n11 He will slap out his hands into it\nLike a swimmer slapping out his hands to swim,\nAnd he will bring down its haughtiness\nWith the skillful movements of his hands.\n12 And the fortified city, with your high walls of security,\nHe will bring down;\nHe will knock it down to the ground, to the very dust.\nChapter 26\n1 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:\n\"We have a strong city.\nHe makes salvation its walls and its ramparts.\n2 Open up the gates so that the righteous nation may enter,\nA nation that is keeping faithful conduct.\n3 You will safeguard those who fully lean on you;\nYou will give them continuous peace,\nBecause it is in you that they trust.\n4 Trust in Jehovah forever,\nFor Jah Jehovah is the eternal Rock.\n5 For he has brought low those inhabiting the height, the lofty city.\nHe brings it down,\nHe brings it down to the earth;\nHe casts it down to the dust.\n6 The foot will trample it,\nThe feet of the afflicted, the steps of the lowly.\"\n7 The path of the righteous one is upright.\nBecause you are upright,\nYou will smooth out the course of the righteous.\n8 As we follow the path of your judgments, O Jehovah,\nOur hope is in you.\nWe long for your name and your memorial.\n9 In the night I long for you with my whole being,\nYes, my spirit keeps looking for you;\nFor when there are judgments from you for the earth,\nThe inhabitants of the land learn about righteousness.\n10 Even if the wicked is shown favor,\nHe will not learn righteousness.\nEven in the land of uprightness he will act wickedly,\nAnd he will not see the majesty of Jehovah.\n11 O Jehovah, your hand is raised, but they do not see it.\nThey will see your zeal for your people and be put to shame.\nYes, the fire for your adversaries will consume them.\n12 O Jehovah, you will grant us peace,\nBecause everything we have done\nYou have accomplished for us.\n13 O Jehovah our God, other masters besides you have ruled over us,\nBut we make mention of your name alone.\n14 They are dead; they will not live.\nPowerless in death, they will not rise up.\nFor you have turned your attention to them\nTo annihilate them and destroy all mention of them.\n15 You have enlarged the nation, O Jehovah,\nYou have enlarged the nation;\nYou have glorified yourself.\nYou have greatly extended all the borders of the land.\n16 O Jehovah, during distress they turned to you;\nThey poured out their prayer in a whisper when you disciplined them.\n17 Just as a pregnant woman about to give birth\nHas labor pains and cries out in pain,\nSo we have been because of you, O Jehovah.\n18 We became pregnant, we had labor pains,\nBut it is as if we had given birth to wind.\nWe have not brought salvation to the land,\nAnd no one is born to inhabit the land.\n19 \"Your dead will live.\nMy corpses will rise up.\nAwake and shout joyfully,\nYou residents in the dust!\nFor your dew is as the dew of the morning,\nAnd the earth will let those powerless in death come to life.\n20 Go, my people, enter your inner rooms,\nAnd shut your doors behind you.\nHide yourself for a brief moment\nUntil the wrath has passed by.\n21 For look! Jehovah is coming from his place\nTo call the inhabitants of the land to account for their error,\nAnd the land will expose her bloodshed\nAnd will no longer cover over her slain.\"\nChapter 27\n1 In that day Jehovah, with his harsh and great and strong sword,\nWill turn his attention to Leviathan, the gliding serpent,\nTo Leviathan, the twisting serpent,\nAnd he will kill the monster that is in the sea.\n2 In that day sing to her:\n\"A vineyard of foaming wine!\n3 I, Jehovah, am safeguarding her.\nEvery moment I water her.\nI safeguard her night and day,\nSo that no one may harm her.\n4 There is no wrath in me.\nWho will confront me with thornbushes and weeds in the battle?\nI will trample them and set them on fire all together.\n5 Otherwise, let him hold fast to my stronghold.\nLet him make peace with me;\nPeace let him make with me.\"\n6 In the coming days Jacob will take root,\nIsrael will blossom and sprout,\nAnd they will fill the land with produce.\n7 Must he be struck with the stroke of the one striking him?\nOr must he be killed as with the slaughter of his slain?\n8 With a startling cry you will contend with her when sending her away.\nHe will expel her with his fierce blast in the day of the east wind.\n9 So in this way the error of Jacob will be atoned for,\nAnd this will be the full fruitage when his sin is taken away:\nHe will make all the stones of the altar\nLike chalkstones that have been pulverized,\nAnd no sacred poles or incense stands will be left.\n10 For the fortified city will be deserted;\nThe pastures will be forsaken and abandoned like a wilderness.\nThere the calf will graze and lie down\nAnd will consume her branches.\n11 When her twigs have dried up,\nWomen will come and break them off,\nMaking fires with them.\nFor this people is without understanding.\nThat is why their Maker will show them no mercy,\nAnd the One who formed them will show them no favor.\n12 In that day Jehovah will beat out the fruit from the flowing stream of the River to the Wadi of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one after the other, O people of Israel. 13 In that day a great horn will be blown, and those who are perishing in the land of Assyria and those dispersed in the land of Egypt will come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.\nChapter 28\n1 Woe to the showy crown of the drunkards of Ephraim\nAnd the fading blossom of its glorious beauty,\nWhich is on the head of the fertile valley of those overcome with wine!\n2 Look! Jehovah has someone strong and mighty.\nLike a thundering hailstorm, a destructive windstorm,\nLike a thunderstorm of powerful floodwaters,\nHe will forcefully hurl it down to the earth.\n3 The showy crowns of the drunkards of Ephraim\nWill be trampled underfoot.\n4 And the fading flower of its glorious beauty,\nWhich is on the head of the fertile valley,\nWill become like the early fig before summer.\nWhen someone sees it, he swallows it as soon as it is in his hand.\n5 In that day Jehovah of armies will become a glorious crown and a beautiful garland to those left of his people. 6 And he will become a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment and a source of mightiness to those who repel the attack at the gate.\n7 And these also go astray because of wine;\nTheir alcoholic beverages make them stagger.\nPriest and prophet go astray because of alcohol;\nThe wine confuses them,\nAnd they stagger from their alcohol;\nTheir vision makes them go astray,\nAnd they stumble in judgment.\n8 For their tables are full of filthy vomit\n-There is no place without it.\n9 To whom will one impart knowledge,\nAnd to whom will one explain the message?\nTo those who have just been weaned from milk,\nThose just taken away from the breasts?\n10 For it is \"command after command, command after command,\nLine by line, line by line,\nA little here, a little there.\"\n11 So by means of those with stammering speech and a foreign language, he will speak to this people. 12 He once told them: \"This is the resting-place. Let the weary one rest; this is the place of refreshment,\" but they refused to listen. 13 So to them the word of Jehovah will be:\n\"Command after command, command after command,\nLine by line, line by line,\nA little here, a little there,\"\nSo that when they walk,\nThey will stumble and fall backward\nAnd be broken and ensnared and caught.\n14 So hear the word of Jehovah, you boasters,\nYou rulers of this people in Jerusalem,\n15 For you men say:\n\"We have made a covenant with Death,\nAnd with the Grave we have made an agreement.\nWhen the raging flash flood passes through,\nIt will not reach us,\nFor we have made a lie our refuge\nAnd we have hidden ourselves in falsehood.\"\n16 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n\"Here I am laying as a foundation in Zion a tested stone,\nThe precious cornerstone of a sure foundation.\nNo one exercising faith will panic.\n17 And I will make justice the measuring line\nAnd righteousness the leveling tool.\nThe hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,\nAnd the waters will flood out the hiding place.\n18 Your covenant with Death will be dissolved,\nAnd your agreement with the Grave will not stand.\nWhen the raging flash flood passes through,\nYou will be crushed by it.\n19 As often as it passes through,\nIt will sweep you away;\nFor it will pass through morning after morning,\nDuring the day and during the night.\nOnly terror will make them understand what was heard.\"\n20 For the bed is too short to stretch out on,\nAnd the woven sheet is too narrow to wrap up in.\n21 For Jehovah will rise up as at Mount Perazim;\nHe will rouse himself as in the valley near Gibeon,\nThat he may do his deed-his strange deed-\nAnd that he may carry out his work-his unusual work.\n22 Now do not scoff,\nSo that your bonds may not be further tightened,\nFor I have heard from the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,\nThat an extermination has been determined for all the land.\n23 Give ear and listen to my voice;\nPay attention and listen to what I say.\n24 Does the plower keep plowing all day before he sows seed?\nDoes he continually break up and harrow his ground?\n25 When he has smoothed out its surface,\nDoes he not then scatter black cumin and sow cumin,\nAnd does he not plant wheat, millet, and barley in their places\nAnd spelt around the edges?\n26 For He teaches him the right way;\nHis God instructs him.\n27 For black cumin is not crushed with a threshing sledge,\nAnd a wagon wheel is not driven over cumin.\nRather, black cumin is beaten out with a rod,\nAnd cumin with a staff.\n28 Does a person crush grain for bread?\nNo, he does not thresh it incessantly;\nAnd when he drives the roller of his wagon over it with his horses,\nHe does not crush it.\n29 This also comes from Jehovah of armies,\nWhose counsel is wonderful\nAnd whose achievements are great.\nChapter 29\n1 \"Woe to Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped!\nContinue year after year;\nLet the cycle of festivals continue.\n2 But I will bring distress on Ariel,\nAnd there will be mourning and lamentation,\nAnd she will become to me like an altar hearth of God.\n3 I will encamp on all sides against you,\nAnd I will besiege you with a palisade\nAnd raise up siegeworks against you.\n4 You will be brought low;\nFrom the ground you will speak,\nAnd what you say will be muffled by dust.\nYour voice will come from the ground\nLike the voice of a spirit medium,\nAnd your words will chirp from the dust.\n5 The crowd of your enemies will be like fine powder,\nThe crowd of the tyrants just like the blowing chaff.\nAnd it will happen in an instant, suddenly.\n6 Jehovah of armies will give you his attention\nWith thunder and earthquake and a great noise,\nWith storm wind and tempest and the flames of a consuming fire.\"\n7 Then the crowd of all the nations waging war against Ariel\n-All those waging war against her,\nThe siege towers against her,\nAnd those bringing distress on her-\nWill become like a dream, a vision of the night.\n8 Yes, it will be just as when someone hungry dreams that he is eating,\nBut he wakes up hungry,\nAnd as when someone thirsty dreams that he is drinking,\nBut he wakes up tired and thirsty.\nSo it will happen with the crowd of all the nations\nThat wage war against Mount Zion.\n9 Be stunned and amazed;\nBlind yourselves and be blinded.\nThey are drunk, but not with wine;\nThey are staggering, but not from alcohol.\n10 For Jehovah has poured a spirit of deep sleep on you;\nHe has closed your eyes, the prophets,\nAnd he has covered your heads, the visionaries.\n11 Every vision becomes for you like the words of a sealed book. When they give it to someone who can read, saying: \"Read this out loud, please,\" he will say: \"I cannot, for it is sealed up.\" 12 And when they give the book to someone who cannot read, saying: \"Read this, please,\" he will say: \"I cannot read at all.\"\n13 Jehovah says: \"This people approach me with their mouth\nAnd they honor me with their lips,\nBut their heart is far removed from me;\nAnd their fear of me is based on commands of men that they have been taught.\n14 Therefore, I am the One who will again do wonderful things with this people,\nWith wonder upon wonder;\nAnd the wisdom of their wise men will perish,\nAnd the understanding of their discreet men will be hidden.\"\n15 Woe to those who go to great lengths to conceal their plans from Jehovah.\nTheir deeds are done in a dark place,\nWhile they say: \"Who sees us?\nWho knows about us?\"\n16 How you twist things!\nShould the potter be regarded the same as the clay?\nShould what is made say about its maker:\n\"He did not make me\"?\nAnd does what is formed say about its former:\n\"He shows no understanding\"?\n17 In just a short time, Lebanon will be turned into an orchard,\nAnd the orchard will be regarded as a forest.\n18 In that day the deaf will hear the words of the book,\nAnd out of the gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.\n19 The meek will rejoice greatly in Jehovah,\nAnd the poor among men will be joyful in the Holy One of Israel.\n20 For the tyrant will be no more,\nThe boaster will come to his finish,\nAnd all those keeping alert to do harm will be destroyed,\n21 Those who with a false word make others guilty,\nWho lay traps for the defender in the city gate,\nAnd who with empty arguments deny justice to the righteous one.\n22 So this is what Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob:\n\"Jacob will no longer be ashamed,\nAnd no more will his face grow pale.\n23 For when he sees his children,\nWho are the work of my hands, in his midst,\nThey will sanctify my name;\nYes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,\nAnd they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\n24 Those who are wayward in spirit will acquire understanding,\nAnd those who complain will accept instruction.\"\nChapter 30\n1 \"Woe to the stubborn sons,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"Who carry out plans that are not mine,\nWho make alliances, but not by my spirit,\nIn order to add sin to sin.\n2 They go down to Egypt without consulting me,\nTo take shelter under Pharaoh's protection\nAnd to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!\n3 But the protection of Pharaoh will become for you a reason for shame,\nAnd refuge in Egypt's shadow a cause for humiliation.\n4 For his princes are in Zoan,\nAnd his envoys have reached Hanes.\n5 They will all be put to shame\nBy a people who can bring no benefit to them,\nWho offer no help and no benefit,\nOnly shame and disgrace.\"\n6 A pronouncement against the beasts of the south:\nThrough the land of distress and hardship,\nOf the lion, the roaring lion,\nOf the viper and the flying fiery snake,\nThey carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys\nAnd their supplies on the humps of camels.\nBut these things will not benefit the people.\n7 For Egypt's help is completely useless.\nSo I have called this one: \"Rahab, who sits still.\"\n8 \"Now go, write it on a tablet in their presence,\nAnd inscribe it in a book,\nSo that it may serve for a future day\nAs a permanent witness.\n9 For they are a rebellious people, deceitful sons,\nSons who are unwilling to hear the law of Jehovah.\n10 They say to the seers, 'Do not see,'\nAnd to the visionaries, 'Do not tell us truthful visions.\nTell us flattering things; envision deceptive illusions.\n11 Turn aside from the way; deviate from the path.\nQuit putting before us the Holy One of Israel.'\"\n12 Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says:\n\"Since you reject this word\nAnd you trust in fraud and deceit\nAnd you rely on these,\n13 So this error will be for you like a broken wall,\nLike a bulging high wall ready to fall.\nIt will crash suddenly, in an instant.\n14 It will be broken like a large potter's jar,\nSo completely smashed that no fragment among its pieces will be left\nTo rake the fire from the fireplace\nOr to scoop water from a puddle.\"\n15 For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, says:\n\"By returning to me and resting, you will be saved;\nYour strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.\"\nBut you were unwilling.\n16 Instead, you said: \"No, we will flee on horses!\"\nSo flee you will.\n\"And on swift horses we will ride!\"\nSo those pursuing you will be swift.\n17 A thousand will tremble at the threat of one;\nAt the threat of five you will flee\nUntil what is left of you is like a mast on the top of a mountain,\nLike a signal pole on a hill.\n18 But Jehovah is waiting patiently to show you favor,\nAnd he will rise up to show you mercy.\nFor Jehovah is a God of justice.\nHappy are all those keeping in expectation of him.\n19 When the people dwell in Zion, in Jerusalem, you will by no means weep. He will surely show you favor at the sound of your cry for help; he will answer you as soon as he hears it. 20 Though Jehovah will give you bread in the form of distress and water in the form of oppression, your Grand Instructor will no longer hide himself, and you will see your Grand Instructor with your own eyes. 21 And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying, \"This is the way. Walk in it,\" in case you should go to the right or in case you should go to the left.\n22 And you will defile the silver overlay of your graven images and the golden plating of your metal statues. You will cast them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, \"Be gone!\" 23 And he will give the rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the bread that the ground produces will be abundant and rich. In that day your livestock will graze in spacious pastures. 24 And the cattle and the donkeys that work the ground will eat fodder seasoned with sorrel, which was winnowed with the shovel and the pitchfork. 25 And on every tall mountain and on every high hill will be streams and watercourses, in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall. 26 And the light of the full moon will become like the light of the sun; and the light of the sun will become seven times stronger, like the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the breakdown of his people and heals the severe wound from the blow he inflicted.\n27 Look! The name of Jehovah is coming from far away,\nBurning with his anger and with heavy clouds.\nHis lips are full of indignation,\nAnd his tongue is like a consuming fire.\n28 His spirit is like a flooding torrent that reaches clear to the neck,\nTo shake the nations in a sieve of destruction;\nAnd the peoples will have a bridle in their jaws that leads them astray.\n29 But your song will be like the one sung in the night\nWhen you prepare for a festival,\nAnd your heart will rejoice like one\nWho walks with a flute\nOn his way to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.\n30 Jehovah will make his majestic voice heard\nAnd reveal his arm as it descends in the heat of anger,\nWith the flame of a consuming fire,\nA cloudburst and a thunderstorm and hailstones.\n31 For because of the voice of Jehovah, Assyria will be struck with terror;\nHe will strike it with a rod.\n32 And every swing of his rod of punishment\nThat Jehovah will bring down on Assyria\nWill be accompanied by tambourines and harps\nAs he brandishes his arm against them in battle.\n33 For his Topheth is already prepared;\nIt is also made ready for the king.\nHe has made the woodpile deep and wide,\nWith an abundance of fire and wood.\nThe breath of Jehovah, like a torrent of sulfur,\nWill set fire to it.\nChapter 31\n1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for assistance,\nWho rely on horses,\nWho trust in war chariots because they are numerous,\nAnd in warhorses because they are mighty.\nBut they do not look to the Holy One of Israel,\nAnd they do not search for Jehovah.\n2 But he is also wise and will bring calamity,\nAnd he will not take back his words.\nHe will rise up against the house of evildoers\nAnd against those who help wrongdoers.\n3 The Egyptians, though, are mere men and not God;\nTheir horses are flesh and not spirit.\nWhen Jehovah stretches out his hand,\nWhoever offers help will stumble\nAnd whoever is helped will fall;\nThey will all perish at the same time.\n4 For this is what Jehovah has said to me:\n\"Just as the lion growls, a strong young lion, over its prey,\nWhen a whole group of shepherds is called together against it,\nAnd it is not terrified by their voice\nOr daunted by their commotion,\nSo will Jehovah of armies come down to wage war\nOver Mount Zion and over her hill.\n5 Like swooping birds, so Jehovah of armies will defend Jerusalem.\nHe will defend her and save her.\nHe will spare her and rescue her.\"\n6 \"Return to the One against whom you have blatantly revolted, O people of Israel. 7 For in that day each one will reject his worthless gods of silver and his valueless gods of gold, which your own hands sinfully made.\n8 And the Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of a man;\nAnd a sword, not of a human, will devour him.\nHe will flee because of the sword,\nAnd his young men will be put to forced labor.\n9 His crag will pass away because of sheer fright,\nAnd his princes will be terrified because of the signal pole,\" declares Jehovah,\nWhose light is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.\nChapter 32\n1 Look! A king will reign for righteousness,\nAnd princes will rule for justice.\n2 And each one will be like a hiding place from the wind,\nA place of concealment from the rainstorm,\nLike streams of water in a waterless land,\nLike the shadow of a massive crag in a parched land.\n3 Then the eyes of those seeing will no longer be pasted shut,\nAnd the ears of those hearing will pay attention.\n4 The heart of those who are impetuous will ponder over knowledge,\nAnd the stammering tongue will speak fluently and clearly.\n5 The senseless one will no longer be called generous,\nAnd the unprincipled man will not be called noble;\n6 For the senseless one will speak nonsense,\nAnd his heart will devise harmful things,\nTo promote apostasy and to speak what is wayward against Jehovah,\nTo cause the hungry one to go unfed\nAnd to deprive the thirsty one of something to drink.\n7 The devices of the unprincipled man are bad;\nHe promotes shameful conduct\nTo ruin the afflicted one with lies,\nEven when the poor speaks what is right.\n8 But the generous one has generous intentions,\nAnd in generous endeavors he perseveres.\n9 \"You complacent women, get up and listen to my voice!\nYou carefree daughters, pay attention to what I say!\n10 In a little over a year, you who are carefree will shudder,\nBecause no fruit will have been gathered when the grape harvest ends.\n11 Tremble, you complacent women!\nShudder, you who are carefree!\nStrip yourselves bare,\nAnd put sackcloth around your hips.\n12 Beat your breasts in lamentation\nOver the desirable fields and the fruitful vine.\n13 For the ground of my people will be covered with thorns and briars;\nThey will cover all the houses of rejoicing,\nYes, the city of exultation.\n14 For the fortified tower has been forsaken;\nThe noisy city has been abandoned.\nOphel and the watchtower have become a permanent wasteland,\nA delight for wild donkeys,\nA pasture for the flocks,\n15 Until the spirit is poured out on us from above,\nAnd the wilderness becomes an orchard,\nAnd the orchard is regarded as a forest.\n16 Then justice will reside in the wilderness,\nAnd righteousness will dwell in the orchard.\n17 The result of true righteousness will be peace,\nAnd the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquility and security.\n18 My people will dwell in a peaceful abiding place,\nIn secure dwellings and in tranquil resting-places.\n19 But the hail will flatten the forest,\nAnd the city will be completely leveled.\n20 Happy are you who sow seed alongside all waters,\nWho send out the bull and the donkey.\"\nChapter 33\n1 Woe to you, you destroyer who has not been destroyed;\nYou betrayer who has not been betrayed!\nWhen you finish destroying, you will be destroyed.\nWhen you finish betraying, you will be betrayed.\n2 O Jehovah, show us favor.\nOur hope is in you.\nBecome our arm every morning,\nYes, our salvation in the time of distress.\n3 At the sound of turmoil peoples flee.\nWhen you rise up, nations scatter.\n4 As the voracious locusts gather, so your spoil will be gathered;\nPeople will rush on it like swarms of locusts.\n5 Jehovah will be exalted,\nFor he resides in the heights above.\nHe will fill Zion with justice and righteousness.\n6 He is the stability of your times;\nAn abundance of salvation, wisdom, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah\n-This is his treasure.\n7 Look! Their heroes cry out in the street;\nThe messengers of peace weep bitterly.\n8 The highways are deserted;\nThere is no one traveling on the pathways.\nHe has broken the covenant;\nHe has rejected the cities;\nHe shows no regard for mortal man.\n9 The land mourns and withers away.\nLebanon is ashamed;

They took up a position by the conduit of the upper pool, which is at the highway of the laundryman's field. 3 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came out to him.\n4 So the Rabshakeh said to them: \"Please, say to Hezekiah, 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: \"What is the basis for your confidence? 5 You are saying, 'I have a strategy and the power to wage war,' but these are empty words. In whom have you put trust, so that you dare to rebel against me? 6 Look! You trust in the support of this crushed reed, Egypt, which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it. That is the way Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all those who trust in him. 7 And if you should say to me, 'We trust in Jehovah our God,' is he not the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, while he says to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You should bow down before this altar'?\"' 8 So now make this wager, please, with my lord the king of Assyria: I will give you 2,000 horses if you are able to find enough riders for them. 9 How, then, could you drive back even one governor who is the least of my lord's servants, while you put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 10 Now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Jehovah himself said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'\"\n11 At this Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rabshakeh: \"Speak to your servants, please, in the Aramaic language, for we can understand it; do not speak to us in the language of the Jews in the hearing of the people on the wall.\" 12 But the Rabshakeh said: \"Is it just to your lord and to you that my lord sent me to speak these words? Is it not also to the men who sit on the wall, those who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you?\"\n13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in the language of the Jews, saying: \"Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 14 This is what the king says, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he is not able to rescue you. 15 And do not let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah by saying: \"Jehovah will surely rescue us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\" 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: \"Make peace with me and surrender, and each of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree and will drink the water of his own cistern, 17 until I come and take you to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 18 Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, 'Jehovah will rescue us.' Have any of the gods of the nations rescued their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they rescued Samaria out of my hand? 20 Who among all the gods of these lands have rescued their land out of my hand, so that Jehovah should rescue Jerusalem out of my hand?\"'\"\n21 But they kept silent and did not say a word to him in reply, for the order of the king was, \"You must not answer him.\" 22 But Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their garments ripped apart and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.\nChapter 37\n1 As soon as King Hezekiah heard this, he ripped his garments apart and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of Jehovah. 2 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the household, Shebna the secretary, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. 3 They said to him: \"This is what Hezekiah says, 'This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; for the children are ready to be born, but there is no strength to give birth. 4 Perhaps Jehovah your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his lord sent to taunt the living God, and he will call him to account for the words that Jehovah your God has heard. So offer up a prayer in behalf of the remnant who have survived.'\"\n5 So the servants of King Hezekiah went in to Isaiah, 6 and Isaiah said to them: \"This is what you should say to your lord, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Do not be afraid because of the words that you heard, the words with which the attendants of the king of Assyria blasphemed me. 7 Here I am putting a thought in his mind, and he will hear a report and return to his own land; and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.\"'\"\n8 After the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had pulled away from Lachish, he returned to him and found him fighting against Libnah. 9 Now the king heard it said about King Tirhakah of Ethiopia: \"He has come out to fight against you.\" When he heard this, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying: 10 \"This is what you should say to King Hezekiah of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying: \"Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\" 11 Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction. Will you alone be rescued? 12 Did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed rescue them? Where are Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? 13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, and of Hena, and of Ivvah?'\"\n14 Hezekiah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them. Hezekiah then went up to the house of Jehovah and spread them out before Jehovah. 15 And Hezekiah began to pray to Jehovah and say: 16 \"O Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, sitting enthroned above the cherubs, you alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth. 17 Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear! Open your eyes, O Jehovah, and see! Hear all the words that Sennacherib has sent to taunt the living God. 18 It is a fact, O Jehovah, that the kings of Assyria have devastated all the lands, as well as their own land. 19 And they have thrown their gods into the fire, because they were not gods but the work of human hands, wood and stone. That is why they could destroy them. 20 But now, O Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are God, O Jehovah.\"\n21 Isaiah son of Amoz then sent this message to Hezekiah: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'Because you prayed to me concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria, 22 this is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him:\n\"The virgin daughter of Zion despises you, she scoffs at you.\nThe daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.\n23 Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?\nAgainst whom have you raised your voice\nAnd lifted your arrogant eyes?\nIt is against the Holy One of Israel!\n24 Through your servants you have taunted Jehovah and said,\n'With the multitude of my war chariots\nI will ascend the heights of mountains,\nThe remotest parts of Lebanon.\nI will cut down its lofty cedars, its choice juniper trees.\nI will enter its highest retreats, its densest forests.\n25 I will dig wells and drink waters;\nI will dry up the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.'\n26 Have you not heard? From long ago it was determined.\nFrom days gone by I have prepared it.\nNow I will bring it about.\nYou will turn fortified cities into desolate piles of ruins.\n27 Their inhabitants will be helpless;\nThey will be terrified and put to shame.\nThey will become as vegetation of the field and green grass,\nAs grass of the roofs that is scorched by the east wind.\n28 But I well know when you sit, when you go out, when you come in,\nAnd when you are enraged against me,\n29 Because your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears.\nSo I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle between your lips,\nAnd I will lead you back the way you came.\"\n30 \"'And this will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows on its own; and in the second year, you will eat grain that sprouts from that; but in the third year you will sow seed and reap, and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. 31 Those of the house of Judah who escape, those who are left, will take root downward and produce fruit upward. 32 For a remnant will go out of Jerusalem and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.\n33 \"'Therefore this is what Jehovah says about the king of Assyria:\n\"He will not come into this city\nOr shoot an arrow there\nOr confront it with a shield\nOr cast up a siege rampart against it.\"'\n34 'By the way he came he will return;\nHe will not come into this city,' declares Jehovah.\n35 'I will defend this city and save it for my own sake\nAnd for the sake of my servant David.'\"\n36 And the angel of Jehovah went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose up early in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies. 37 So King Sennacherib of Assyria departed and returned to Nineveh and stayed there. 38 And as he was bowing down at the house of his god Nisroch, his own sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and then escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon became king in his place.\nChapter 38\n1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came and said to him, \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Give instructions to your household, for you will die; you will not recover.'\" 2 At that Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and began to pray to Jehovah: 3 \"I beg you, O Jehovah, remember, please, how I have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart, and I have done what was good in your eyes.\" And Hezekiah began to weep profusely.\n4 Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying: 5 \"Go back and say to Hezekiah, 'This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says: \"I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Here I am adding 15 years to your life, 6 and I will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city. 7 This is the sign from Jehovah to show you that Jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken: 8 Here I will make the declining shadow of the sun on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps.\"'\" So the sun went back ten steps on the stairway that it had already descended.\n9 A writing of King Hezekiah of Judah when he became sick and recovered from his sickness.\n10 I said: \"In the middle of my life\nI must go into the gates of the Grave.\nI will be deprived of my remaining years.\"\n11 I said: \"I will not see Jah, Jah in the land of the living.\nI will look no more on mankind\nWhen I am with the inhabitants of the place where everything ceases.\n12 My own dwelling has been pulled out and removed from me\nLike the tent of a shepherd.\nI have rolled up my life like a loom worker;\nHe cuts me off like the threads of the warp.\nFrom daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end.\n13 I calm myself until the morning.\nLike a lion, he keeps breaking all my bones;\nFrom daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end.\n14 Like the swift or the thrush, so I keep chirping;\nI keep cooing like the dove.\nMy eyes look wearily to the height:\n'O Jehovah, I am in great distress;\nBe my support!'\n15 What can I say?\nHe has spoken to me and acted.\nI will walk humbly all my years\nBecause of my bitter distress.\n16 'O Jehovah, by these things every man lives,\nAnd in them is the life of my spirit.\nYou will restore me to health and preserve me alive.\n17 Look! Instead of peace, I had great bitterness;\nBut in your fondness for me,\nYou preserved me from the pit of destruction.\nYou have thrown all my sins behind your back.\n18 For the Grave cannot glorify you,\nDeath cannot praise you.\nThose who go down into the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.\n19 The living, the living can praise you,\nJust as I can this day.\nA father can give his sons knowledge about your faithfulness.\n20 O Jehovah, save me,\nAnd we will play my songs on stringed instruments\nAll the days of our life at the house of Jehovah.'\"\n21 Isaiah then said: \"Bring a cake of pressed dried figs and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover.\" 22 Hezekiah had asked: \"What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Jehovah?\"\nChapter 39\n1 At that time the king of Babylon, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 2 Hezekiah gladly welcomed them and showed them his treasure-house-the silver, the gold, the balsam oil and other precious oil, his whole armory, and everything that was to be found in his treasuries. There was nothing that Hezekiah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion.\n3 After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hezekiah and asked him: \"What did these men say, and where did they come from?\" So Hezekiah said: \"They came from a distant land, from Babylon.\" 4 Next he asked: \"What did they see in your house?\" Hezekiah replied: \"They saw everything in my house. There was nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries.\"\n5 Isaiah now said to Hezekiah: \"Hear the word of Jehovah of armies, 6 'Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your house and all that your forefathers have stored up to this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' says Jehovah. 7 'And some of your own sons to whom you will become father will be taken and will become court officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.'\"\n8 At that Hezekiah said to Isaiah: \"The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good.\" Then he added: \"Because there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.\"\nChapter 40\n1 \"Comfort, comfort my people,\" says your God.\n2 \"Speak to the heart of Jerusalem,\nAnd proclaim to her that her compulsory service has been fulfilled,\nThat her guilt has been paid off.\nFrom the hand of Jehovah she has received a full amount for all her sins.\"\n3 A voice of one calling out in the wilderness:\n\"Clear up the way of Jehovah!\nMake a straight highway through the desert for our God.\n4 Let every valley be raised up,\nAnd every mountain and hill be made low.\nThe rough ground must become level,\nAnd the rugged ground a valley plain.\n5 The glory of Jehovah will be revealed,\nAnd all flesh will see it together,\nFor the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.\"\n6 Listen!

not flood over you.\nWhen you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,\nNor will the flame singe you.\n3 For I am Jehovah your God,\nThe Holy One of Israel, your Savior.\nI have given Egypt as a ransom for you,\nEthiopia and Seba in exchange for you.\n4 For you became precious in my eyes,\nYou were honored, and I have loved you.\nSo I will give people in place of you\nAnd nations in

the south, 'Do not hold them back.\nBring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth,\n7 Everyone who is called by my name\nAnd whom I created for my own glory,\nWhom I have formed and made.'\n8 Bring out a people who are blind, though they have eyes,\nAnd who are deaf, though they have ears.\n9 Let all the nations assemble in one place,\nAnd let the peoples be gathered together.\nWho among them can tell this?\nOr can they cause us to hear the first things?\nLet them present their witnesses to prove themselves right,\nOr let them hear and say, 'It is the

more than that of any other man\nAnd his stately form more than that of mankind-\n15 So he will startle many nations.\nKings will shut their mouths before him,\nBecause they will see what they had not been told\nAnd give consideration to what they had not heard.\nChapter 53\n1 Who has put faith in the thing heard from us?\nAnd as for the arm of Jehovah, to whom has it been revealed?\n2 He will come up like a twig before him, like a root out of parched land.\nNo stately form does he have, nor any splendor;\nAnd when we see him, his appearance does not draw us to him.\n3 He was despised and was avoided by men,\nA man who was meant for pains and was familiar with sickness.\nIt was as if his face were hidden from us.\nHe was despised, and we held him as of no account.\n4 Truly he himself carried our sicknesses,\nAnd he bore our pains.\nBut we considered him as plagued, stricken by God and afflicted.\n5 But he was pierced for our transgression;\nHe was crushed for our errors.\nHe bore the punishment for our peace,\nAnd because of his wounds we were healed.\n6 Like sheep we have all wandered about,\nEach has turned his own way,\nAnd Jehovah has caused the error of us all to meet up with him.\n7 He was oppressed and he let himself be afflicted,\nBut he would not open his mouth.\nHe was brought like a sheep to the slaughter,\nLike a ewe that is silent before its shearers,\nAnd he would not open his mouth.\n8 Because of restraint and judgment he was taken away;\nAnd who will concern himself with the details of his generation?\nFor he was cut off from the land of the living;\nBecause of the transgression of my people he received the stroke.\n9 And he was given a burial place with the wicked,\nAnd with the rich in his death,\nAlthough he had done no wrong\nAnd there was no deception in his mouth.\n10 But it was Jehovah's will to crush him, and he let him become sick.\nIf you will present his life as a guilt offering,\nHe will see his offspring, he will prolong his days,\nAnd through him the delight of Jehovah will have success.\n11 Because of his anguish, he will see and be satisfied.\nBy means of his knowledge the righteous one, my servant,\nWill bring a righteous standing to many people,\nAnd their errors he will bear.\n12 For that reason I will assign him a portion among the many,\nAnd he will apportion the spoil with the mighty,\nBecause he poured out his life even to death\nAnd was counted among the transgressors;\nHe carried the sin of many people,\nAnd he interceded for the transgressors.\nChapter 54\n1 \"Shout joyfully, you barren woman who has not given birth!\nBecome cheerful and cry out for joy, you who never had birth pains,\nFor the sons of the desolate one are more numerous\nThan the sons of the woman with a husband,\"

Prepare the way!\nRemove any obstacle from the way of my people.'\"\n15 For this is what the High and Lofty One says,\nWho lives forever and whose name is holy:\n\"I reside in the high and holy place,\nBut also with those crushed and lowly in spirit,\nTo revive the spirit of the lowly\nAnd to revive the heart of those being crushed.\n16 For I will not oppose them forever\nOr always remain indignant;\nFor a man's spirit would grow feeble because of me,\nEven the breathing creatures that I have made.\n17 I was indignant at his sinful pursuit of dishonest gain,\nSo I struck him, I hid my face, and I was indignant.\nBut he kept walking as a renegade, following the way of his heart.\n18 I have seen his ways,\nBut I will heal him and lead him\nAnd restore comfort to him and to his mourning ones.\"\n19 \"I am creating the fruit of the lips.\nContinuous peace will be given to the one who is far away and the one who is near,\" says Jehovah,\n\"And I will heal him.\"\n20 \"But the wicked are like the restless sea that cannot calm down,\nAnd its waters keep tossing up seaweed and mire.\n21 There is no peace,\" says my God, \"for the wicked.\"\nChapter 58\n1 \"Call out full-throated; do not hold back!\nRaise your voice like a horn.\nProclaim to my people their revolt,\nTo the house of Jacob their sins.\n2 They seek me day after day,\nAnd they express delight to know my ways,\nAs if they were a nation that had practiced righteousness\nAnd had not abandoned the justice of their God.\nThey ask me for righteous judgments,\nDelighting to draw close to God:\n3 'Why do you not see when we fast?\nAnd why do you not notice when we afflict ourselves?'\nBecause on the day of your fast, you pursue your own interests,\nAnd you oppress your laborers.\n4 Your fasting ends in quarrels and fights,\nAnd you strike with the fist of wickedness.\nYou cannot fast as you do today and have your voice heard in heaven.\n5 Should the fast that I choose be like this,\nAs a day for someone to afflict himself,\nTo bow down his head like a rush,\nTo make his bed on sackcloth and ashes?\nIs this what you call a fast and a day pleasing to Jehovah?\n6 No, this is the fast that I choose:\nTo remove the fetters of wickedness,\nTo untie the bands of the yoke bar,\nTo let the oppressed go free,\nAnd to break in half every yoke bar;\n7 It is to share your bread with the hungry,\nTo bring the poor and homeless into your house,\nTo clothe someone naked when you see him,\nAnd not to turn your back on your own flesh.\n8 Then your light will shine through like the dawn,\nAnd your healing will spring up quickly.\nYour righteousness will go before you,\nAnd the glory of Jehovah will be your rear guard.\n9 Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer;\nYou will cry for help, and he will say, 'Here I am!'\nIf you remove from among you the yoke bar\nAnd stop pointing your finger and speaking maliciously,\n10 If you grant to the hungry what you yourself desire\nAnd satisfy those who are afflicted,\nThen your light will shine even in the darkness,\nAnd your gloom will be like midday.\n11 Jehovah will always lead you\nAnd satisfy you even in a parched land;\nHe will invigorate your bones,\nAnd you will become like a well-watered garden,\nLike a spring whose waters never fail.\n12 They will rebuild ancient ruins on your account,\nAnd you will restore the foundations of past generations.\nYou will be called the repairer of the broken walls,\nThe restorer of roadways by which to dwell.\n13 If because of the Sabbath you refrain from pursuing your own interests on my holy day\nAnd you call the Sabbath an exquisite delight, a holy day of Jehovah, a day to be glorified,\nAnd you glorify it rather than pursuing your own interests and speaking idle words,\n14 Then you will find your exquisite delight in Jehovah,\nAnd I will make you ride on the high places of the earth.\nI will cause you to eat from the inheritance of Jacob your forefather,\nFor the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.\"\nChapter 59\n1 Look! The hand of Jehovah is not too short to save,\nNor is his ear too dull to hear.\n2 No, your own errors have separated you from your God.\nYour sins have made him hide his face from you,\nAnd he refuses to hear you.\n3 For your palms are polluted with blood\nAnd your fingers with error.\nYour lips speak lies, and your tongue mutters unrighteousness.\n4 No one calls out for righteousness,\nAnd no one goes to court in truthfulness.\nThey trust in unreality and speak what is worthless.\nThey conceive trouble and give birth to what is harmful.\n5 They hatch the eggs of a poisonous snake,\nAnd they weave the cobweb of a spider.\nAnyone who eats their eggs would die,\nAnd the egg that is crushed hatches a viper.\n6 Their cobweb will not serve as a garment,\nNor will they cover themselves with what they make.\nTheir works are harmful,\nAnd deeds of violence are in their hands.\n7 Their feet run to do evil,\nAnd they hurry to shed innocent blood.\nTheir thoughts are harmful thoughts;\nRuin and misery are in their ways.\n8 They have not known the way of peace,\nAnd there is no justice in their tracks.\nThey make their roadways crooked;\nNo one treading on them will know peace.\n9 That is why justice is far away from us,\nAnd righteousness does not overtake us.\nWe keep hoping for light, but look! there is darkness;\nFor brightness, but we keep walking in gloom.\n10 We grope for the wall like blind men;\nLike those without eyes we keep groping.\nWe stumble at high noon as in evening darkness;\nAmong the strong we are just like the dead.\n11 We all keep growling like bears\nAnd cooing mournfully like doves.\nWe hope for justice, but there is none;\nFor salvation, but it is far away from us.\n12 For our revolts are many before you;\nEach of our sins testifies against us.\nFor our revolts are with us;\nWe well know our errors.\n13 We have transgressed and denied Jehovah;\nWe have turned our backs on our God.\nWe have spoken of oppression and revolt;\nWe have conceived lies and muttered false words from the heart.\n14 Justice is driven back,\nAnd righteousness stands far off;\nFor truth has stumbled in the public square,\nAnd what is upright is unable to enter.\n15 Truth has vanished,\nAnd anyone who turns away from bad is plundered.\nJehovah saw this and was displeased,\nFor there was no justice.\n16 He saw that there was no man,\nAnd he was astonished that no one interceded,\nSo his own arm brought about salvation,\nAnd his own righteousness supported him.\n17 Then he put on righteousness like a coat of mail\nAnd the helmet of salvation on his head.\nHe put on the garments of vengeance as his clothing\nAnd wrapped himself with zeal like a coat.\n18 He will reward them for what they have done:\nWrath to his adversaries, retribution to his enemies.\nAnd to the islands he will repay their due.\n19 From the sunset they will fear the name of Jehovah\nAnd from the sunrise his glory,\nFor he will come in like a rushing river,\nWhich the spirit of Jehovah drives along.\n20 \"To Zion the Repurchaser will come,\nTo those in Jacob who turn from transgression,\" declares Jehovah.\n21 \"As for me, this is my covenant with them,\" says Jehovah. \"My spirit that is on you and my words that I have placed in your mouth-they will not be removed from your mouth, from the mouth of your children, or from the mouth of your grandchildren,\" says Jehovah, \"from now on and forever.\"\nChapter 60\n1 \"Arise, O woman, shed light, for your light has come.\nThe glory of Jehovah shines on you.\n2 For look! darkness will cover the earth\nAnd

land,\nYoung male camels of Midian and Ephah.\nAll those from Sheba-they will come;\nGold and frankincense they will carry.\nThey will proclaim the praises of Jehovah.\n7 All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you.\nThe rams of Nebaioth will serve you.\nThey will come on my altar with approval,\nAnd I will beautify my glorious house.\n8 Who are these that fly along like clouds,\nLike doves to their dovecotes?\n9 For in me the islands will hope;\nThe ships of Tarshish are in the lead,\nTo bring your sons from far away,\nAlong with their silver and their gold,\nTo the name of Jehovah your God and to the Holy One of Israel,\nFor he will glorify you.\n10 Foreigners will build your walls,\nAnd their kings will minister to you,\nFor in my indignation I struck you,\nBut in my favor I will have mercy on you.\n11 Your gates will be kept open constantly;\nThey will not be closed by day or by night,\nTo bring to you the resources of the nations,\nAnd their kings will take the lead.\n12 For any nation and any kingdom that will not serve you will perish,\nAnd the nations will be utterly devastated.\n13 To you the glory of Lebanon will come,\nThe juniper tree, the ash tree, and the cypress together,\nTo beautify the place of my sanctuary;\nI will glorify the place for my feet.\n14 The sons of those who oppressed you will come and bow down before you;\nAll those treating you disrespectfully must bow down at your feet,\nAnd they will have to call you the city of Jehovah,\nZion of the Holy One of Israel.\n15 Instead of your being abandoned and hated, with nobody passing through,\nI will make you a source of everlasting pride,\nA cause for rejoicing throughout all generations.\n16 And you will actually drink the milk of nations,\nAt the breast of kings you will nurse;\nAnd you will certainly know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior,\nAnd the Powerful One of Jacob is your Repurchaser.\n17 Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,\nAnd instead of the iron I will bring in silver,\nInstead of the wood, copper,\nAnd instead of the stones, iron;\nAnd I will appoint peace as your overseers\nAnd righteousness as your task assigners.\n18 No more will violence be heard in your land\nOr destruction and ruin within your boundaries.\nAnd you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.\n19 For you the sun will no longer be a light by day,\nNor will the shining of the moon give you light,\nFor Jehovah will become to you an eternal light,\nAnd your God will be your beauty.\n20 No more will your sun set,\nNor will your moon wane,\nFor Jehovah will become for you an eternal light,\nAnd the days of your mourning will have ended.\n21 And all your people will be righteous;\nThey will possess the land forever.\nThey are the sprout that I planted,\nThe work of my hands, for me to be beautified.\n22 The little one will become a thousand\nAnd the small one a mighty nation.\nI myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.\"\nChapter 61\n1 The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me,\nBecause Jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek.\nHe sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\nTo proclaim liberty to the captives\nAnd the wide opening of the eyes to the prisoners,\n2 To proclaim the year of Jehovah's goodwill\nAnd the day of vengeance of our God,\nTo comfort all who mourn,\n3 To provide for those mourning over Zion,\nTo give them a headdress instead of ashes,\nThe oil of exultation instead of mourning,\nThe garment of praise instead of a despondent spirit.\nAnd they will be called big trees of righteousness,\nThe planting of Jehovah, in order to glorify him.\n4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins;\nThey will raise up the desolated places of the past,\nAnd they will restore the devastated cities,\nThe places that lay desolate for generation after generation.\n5 \"Strangers will stand and shepherd your flocks,\nAnd foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.\n6 As for you, you will be called the priests of Jehovah;\nThey will call you the ministers of our God.\nYou will eat the resources of the nations,\nAnd about their glory you will boast.\n7 Instead of shame you will have a double portion,\nAnd instead of humiliation they will shout joyfully over their share.\nYes, they will possess a double portion in their land.\nEverlasting rejoicing will be theirs.\n8 For I, Jehovah, love justice;\nI hate robbery and unrighteousness.\nI will faithfully give them their wages,\nAnd I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\n9 Their offspring will be known among the nations\nAnd their descendants among the peoples.\nAll who see them will recognize them,\nThat they are the offspring whom Jehovah has blessed.\"\n10 I will greatly exult in Jehovah.\nMy whole being will rejoice in my God.\nFor he has clothed me with the garments of salvation;\nHe has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness,\nJust like a bridegroom who wears a turban like that of a priest,\nAnd

My servants will shout joyfully because of the good condition of the heart,\nBut you will cry out because of the pain of heart\nAnd you will wail because of a broken spirit.\n15 You will leave behind a name that my chosen ones will use as a curse,\nAnd the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will put each of you to death,\nBut his own servants he will call by another name;\n16 So that anyone who seeks a blessing for himself in the earth\nWill be blessed by the God of truth,\nAnd anyone who swears an oath in the earth\nWill swear by the God of truth.\nFor the former distresses will be forgotten;\nThey will be concealed from my eyes.\n17 For look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth;\nAnd the former things will not be called to mind,\nNor will they come up into the heart.\n18 So exult and be joyful forever in what I am creating.\nFor look! I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joy\nAnd her people a cause for exultation.\n19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and exult in my people;\nNo more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or a cry of distress.\"\n20 \"No more will there be an infant from that place who lives but a few days,\nNor an old man who fails to live out his days.\nFor anyone who dies at a hundred will be considered a mere boy,\nAnd the sinner will be cursed, even though he is a hundred years of age.\n21 They will build houses and live in them,\nAnd they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.\n22 They will not build for someone else to inhabit,\nNor will they plant for others to eat.\nFor the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,\nAnd the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.\n23 They will not toil for nothing,\nNor will they bear children for distress,\nBecause they are the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah,\nAnd their descendants with them.\n24 Even before they call out, I will answer;\nWhile they are yet speaking, I will hear.\n25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together,\nThe lion will eat straw just like the bull,\nAnd the serpent's food will be dust.\nThey will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,\" says Jehovah.\nChapter 66\n1 This is what Jehovah says:\n\"The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool.\nWhere, then, is the house that you could build for me,\nAnd where is my resting-place?\"\n2 \"My own hand has made all these things,\nAnd this is how they all came to be,\" declares Jehovah.\n\"To this one, then, I will look,\nTo the one humble and broken in spirit who trembles at my word.\n3 The one slaughtering the bull is like one striking down a man.\nThe one sacrificing a sheep is like one breaking the neck of a dog.\nThe one offering a gift-like the blood of a pig!\nThe one presenting a memorial offering of frankincense is like one saying a blessing with magical words.\nThey have chosen their own ways,\nAnd they take delight in what is disgusting.\n4 So I will choose ways to punish them,\nAnd the very things they dread I will bring upon them.\nBecause when I called, no one answered;\nWhen I spoke, there were none who listened.\nThey kept doing what was bad in my eyes,\nAnd they chose to do what displeased me.\"\n5 Hear the word of Jehovah, you who tremble at his word:\n\"Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name said, 'May Jehovah be glorified!'\nBut He will appear and bring you joy,\nAnd they are the ones who will be put to shame.\"\n6 There is a sound of uproar from the city, a sound from the temple!\nIt is the sound of Jehovah repaying his enemies what they deserve.\n7 Before she went into labor, she gave birth.\nBefore birth pangs came to her, she delivered a male child.\n8 Who has ever heard of such a thing?\nWho has seen such things?\nWill a land be brought to birth in one day?\nOr will a nation be born all at once?\nYet, as soon as Zion went into labor, she gave birth to her sons.\n9 \"Will I bring it to the point of birth and then not bring it forth?\" says Jehovah.\n\"Or would I cause the birth and then shut the womb?\" says your God.\n10 Rejoice with Jerusalem and be joyful with her, all you who love her.\nExult greatly with her, all you who are in mourning over her,\n11 For you will nurse and be fully satisfied from her breast of consolation,\nAnd you will drink deeply and find delight in the abundance of her glory.\n12 For this is what Jehovah says:\n\"Here I am extending to her peace just like a river\nAnd the glory of nations like a flooding torrent.\nYou will nurse and be carried on the hip,\nAnd you will be bounced on the knees.\n13 As a mother comforts her son,\nSo I will keep comforting you;\nAnd over Jerusalem you will be comforted.\n14 You will see this, and your heart will rejoice,\nYour bones will flourish just like new grass.\nAnd the hand of Jehovah will become known to his servants,\nBut he will denounce his enemies.\"\n15 \"For Jehovah will come as a fire,\nAnd his chariots are like a storm wind,\nTo repay in furious anger,\nTo rebuke with flames of fire.\n16 For with fire Jehovah will execute judgment,\nYes, with his sword, against all flesh;\nAnd the slain of Jehovah will be many.\n17 \"Those sanctifying themselves and cleansing themselves to enter the gardens following one who is in the center, those eating the flesh of pigs and loathsome things and mice, they will all come to their end together,\" declares Jehovah. 18 \"Since I know about their works and their thoughts, I am coming to gather people of all nations and languages, and they will come and see my glory.\"\n19 \"I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who escape to the nations-to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, those who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, and to the faraway islands-who have not heard a report about me or seen my glory; and they will proclaim my glory among the nations. 20 They will bring all your brothers out of all the nations as a gift to Jehovah, on horses, in chariots, in covered wagons, on mules, and on swift camels, up to my holy mountain, Jerusalem,\" says Jehovah, \"just as when the people of Israel bring their gift in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.\"\n21 \"I will also take some for the priests and for the Levites,\" says Jehovah.\n22 \"For just as the new heavens and the new earth that I am making will remain standing before me,\" declares Jehovah, \"so your offspring and your name will remain.\"\n23 \"And from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath,\nAll flesh will come in to bow down before me,\" says Jehovah.\n24 \"And they will go out and look on the carcasses of the men who rebelled against me;\nFor the worms on them will not die,\nAnd their fire will not be extinguished,\nAnd they will become something repulsive to all people.\"\n",

    "text": "Jeremiah\nChapter 1\n1 These are the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 2 The word of Jehovah came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah, in the 13th year of his reign. 3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the completion of the 11th year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until Jerusalem went into exile in the fifth month.\n4 The word of Jehovah came to me, saying:\n5 \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nAnd before you were born I sanctified you.\nI made you a prophet to the nations.\"\n6 But I said: \"Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!\nI do not know how to speak, for I am just a boy.\"\n7 Jehovah then said to me:\n\"Do not say, 'I am just a boy.'\nFor you must go to all those to whom I send you,\nAnd you should say everything that I command you.\n8 Do not be afraid because of their appearance,\nFor 'I am with you to save you,' declares Jehovah.\"\n9 Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me: \"I have put my words in your mouth. 10 See, I have commissioned you this day to be over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to pull down, to destroy and to tear down, to build and to plant.\"\n11 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: \"What do you see, Jeremiah?\" So I said: \"I see the branch of an almond tree.\"\n12 Jehovah said to me: \"You have seen correctly, for I am wide awake concerning my word to carry it out.\"\n13 The word of Jehovah came to me a second time, saying: \"What do you see?\" So I said: \"I see a boiling pot, and its mouth is tilted away from the north.\" 14 Then Jehovah said to me:\n\"Out of the north the calamity will break loose\nAgainst all the inhabitants of the land.\n15 For 'I am summoning all the families of the kingdoms of the north,' declares Jehovah,\n'And they will come; each one will set up his throne\nAt the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,\nAgainst her walls all around\nAnd against all the cities of Judah.\n16 And I will declare my judgments against them over all their wickedness,\nBecause they have abandoned me,\nAnd they are making sacrificial smoke to other gods\nAnd bowing down to the works of their own hands.'\n17 But you should prepare for action,\nAnd you must stand up and tell them everything that I command you.\nDo not be terrified of them,\nSo that I do not terrify you before them.\n18 For today I have made you a fortified city,\nAn iron pillar, and copper walls against all the land,\nToward the kings of Judah and her princes,\nToward her priests and the people of the land.\n19 And they will certainly fight against you,\nBut they will not prevail against you,\nFor 'I am with you,' declares Jehovah, 'to save you.'\"\nChapter 2\n1 The word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 2 \"Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, 'This is what Jehovah says:\n\"I well remember the devotion of your youth,\nThe love you showed when you were engaged to marry,\nHow you followed me in the wilderness,\nIn a land not sown with seed.\n3 Israel was holy to Jehovah, the firstfruits of his harvest.\"'\n'Anyone devouring him would become guilty.\nDisaster would come upon them,' declares Jehovah.\"\n4 Hear the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob,\nAnd all you families of the house of Israel.\n5 This is what Jehovah says:\n\"What fault did your forefathers find in me,\nSo that they strayed so far from me,\nAnd they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves?\n6 They did not ask, 'Where is Jehovah,\nThe One who brought us out of the land of Egypt,\nWho led us through the wilderness,\nThrough a land of deserts and pits,\nThrough a land of drought and of deep shadow,\nThrough a land where no man travels\nAnd where no humans dwell?'\n7 I then brought you to a land of orchards,\nTo eat its fruitage and its good things.\nBut you came in and defiled my land;\nYou made my inheritance something detestable.\n8 The priests did not ask, 'Where is Jehovah?'\nThose handling the Law did not know me,\nThe shepherds rebelled against me,\nThe prophets prophesied by Baal,\nAnd they followed those who could bring no benefit.\n9 'So I will contend further with you,' declares Jehovah,\n'And I will contend with the sons of your sons.'\n10 'But cross over to the coastlands of the Kittim and see.\nYes, send to Kedar and consider carefully;\nSee whether anything like this has happened.\n11 Has a nation ever changed its gods for those that are not gods?\nBut my own people have exchanged my glory for what is useless.\n12 Stare in amazement at this, you heavens;\nShudder in absolute horror,' declares Jehovah,\n13 'Because my people have done two bad things:\nThey have abandoned me, the source of living water,\nAnd dug for themselves cisterns,\nBroken cisterns, that cannot hold water.'\n14 'Is Israel a servant or a slave born in the household?\nThen why has he been given over to plunder?\n15 Against him young lions roar;\nThey have raised their voice.\nThey made his land an object of horror.\nHis cities have been set on fire, so that there is no inhabitant.\n16 The people of Noph and Tahpanes feed on the crown of your head.\n17 Have you not brought this on yourself\nBy abandoning Jehovah your God\nWhile he was leading you in the way?\n18 Now why do you wish for the way to Egypt\nTo drink the waters of Shihor?\nWhy do you wish for the way to Assyria\nTo drink the waters of the River?\n19 Your wickedness should correct you,\nAnd your own unfaithfulness should reprove you.\nKnow and realize how bad and bitter it is\nTo abandon Jehovah your God;\nYou have shown no fear of me,' declares the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.\n20 'For long ago I smashed your yoke\nAnd tore off your shackles.\nBut you said: \"I am not going to serve,\"\nFor on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree\nYou were lying sprawled out, prostituting yourself.\n21 I planted you as a choice red vine, all of it pure seed;\nSo how have you turned into the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine before me?'\n22 'Though you should wash with soda and use much lye,\nYour guilt would still be a stain before me,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\n23 How can you say, 'I have not defiled myself.\nI have not followed the Baals'?\nLook at your way in the valley.\nConsider what you have done.\nYou are like a swift, young she-camel,\nAimlessly running back and forth in her ways,\n24 A wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness,\nSniffing the wind in her lust.\nWho can restrain her when she is in heat?\nNone of those looking for her will need to weary themselves.\nIn her season they will find her.\n25 Keep your feet from going bare\nAnd your throat from thirst.\nBut you said, 'It is hopeless!\nNo! I have fallen in love with strangers,\nAnd I will follow them.'\n26 Like the shame of a thief when he is caught,\nSo the house of Israel has been put to shame,\nThey, their kings and their princes,\nTheir priests and their prophets.\n27 They say to a tree, 'You are my father,'\nAnd to a stone, 'You gave birth to me.'\nBut to me they turn their back and not their face.\nAnd in the time of their calamity they will say,\n'Rise up and save us!'\n28 Now where are your gods that you made for yourself?\nLet them rise up if they can save you in your time of calamity,\nFor your gods have become as numerous as your cities, O Judah.\n29 'Why do you keep contending against me?\nWhy have all of you rebelled against me?' declares Jehovah.\n30 I have struck your sons in vain.\nThey would accept no discipline;\nYour own sword devoured your prophets,\nLike a marauding lion.\n31 O generation, consider for yourselves the word of Jehovah.\nHave I become like a wilderness to Israel\nOr a land of oppressive darkness?\nWhy have these, my people, said, 'We roam freely.\nWe will come to you no more'?\n32 Can a virgin forget her ornaments,\nA bride her breastbands?\nAnd yet my own people have forgotten me for countless days.\n33 How skillfully, O woman, you set your course to seek love!\nYou have trained yourself in the ways of wickedness.\n34 Even your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor ones,\nThough I did not find them in the act of breaking in;\nIt is on all your skirts.\n35 But you say, 'I am innocent.\nSurely his anger has turned back from me.'\nNow I am bringing judgment against you\nBecause you say, 'I have not sinned.'\n36 Why do you treat so lightly your unstable course?\nYou will become ashamed of Egypt too,\nJust as you became ashamed of Assyria.\n37 For this reason also you will go out with your hands on your head,\nFor Jehovah has rejected those in whom you put confidence;\nThey will not bring you success.\"\nChapter 3\n1 People ask: \"If a man sends his wife away and she leaves him and becomes another man's, should he return to her anymore?\"\nHas that land not been utterly polluted?\n\"You have committed prostitution with many companions,\nAnd should you now return to me?\" declares Jehovah.\n2 \"Raise your eyes to the bare hills and see.\nWhere have you not been raped?\nYou sat along the roadways for them,\nLike a nomad in the wilderness.\nYou keep polluting the land\nWith your prostitution and your wickedness.\n3 So showers of rain are withheld,\nAnd there is no rain in the spring.\nYou have the brazen look of a wife who commits prostitution;\nYou refuse to feel shame.\n4 But now you call out to me,\n'My Father, you are the companion of my youth!\n5 Should one stay resentful forever,\nOr always hold a grudge?'\nThis is what you say,\nBut you keep doing all the evil you are capable of doing.\"\n6 In the days of King Josiah, Jehovah said to me: \"'Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and underneath every luxuriant tree to commit prostitution. 7 Even after she did all these things, I kept telling her to return to me, but she did not return; and Judah kept watching her treacherous sister. 8 When I saw that, I sent unfaithful Israel away with a full certificate of divorce because of her adultery. But her treacherous sister Judah did not become afraid; she too went out and committed prostitution. 9 She took her prostitution lightly, and she kept polluting the land and committing adultery with stones and with trees. 10 Despite all this, her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, only in pretense,' declares Jehovah.\"\n11 Jehovah then said to me: \"Unfaithful Israel has shown herself to be more righteous than treacherous Judah. 12 Go and proclaim these words to the north:\n\"'\"Return, O renegade Israel,\" declares Jehovah.' '\"I will not look down angrily on you, for I am loyal,\" declares Jehovah.' '\"I will not stay resentful forever. 13 Only acknowledge your guilt, for you have rebelled against Jehovah your God. You continued scattering your favors to strangers under every luxuriant tree, but you would not obey my voice,\" declares Jehovah.'\"\n14 \"Return, you renegade sons,\" declares Jehovah. \"For I have become your true master; and I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion. 15 And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they will feed you with knowledge and insight. 16 You will become many and will bear fruit in the land in those days,\" declares Jehovah. \"No more will they say, 'The ark of the covenant of Jehovah!' It will not come up into the heart, nor will they remember it or miss it, and it will not be made again. 17 At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations will be brought together to the name of Jehovah at Jerusalem, and they will no longer stubbornly follow their own wicked heart.\"\n18 \"In those days they will walk together, the house of Judah alongside the house of Israel, and together they will come from the land of the north into the land that I gave to your forefathers as an inheritance. 19 And I thought, 'How I placed you among the sons and gave you the desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance among the nations!' I also thought that you would call me, 'My Father!' and that you would not turn away from following me. 20 'Truly as a wife treacherously leaves her husband, so also you, O house of Israel, have dealt treacherously with me,' declares Jehovah.\"\n21 On the bare hills a sound is heard,\nThe weeping and the pleading of the people of Israel,\nFor they have distorted their way;\nThey have forgotten Jehovah their God.\n22 \"Return, you renegade sons.\nI will heal your renegade condition.\"\n\"Here we are! We have come to you,\nFor you, O Jehovah, are our God.\n23 Truly the hills and the turmoil on the mountains are a delusion.\nTruly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.\n24 But the shameful thing has consumed the toil of our forefathers since our youth,\nTheir flocks and their herds,\nTheir sons and their daughters.\n25 Let us lie down in our shame,\nAnd let our disgrace cover us,\nFor we have sinned against Jehovah our God,\nWe and our fathers since our youth until this day,\nAnd we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.\"\nChapter 4\n1 \"If you will return, O Israel,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"If you will return to me\nAnd if you will remove your disgusting idols from before me,\nThen you will not be a fugitive.\n2 And if you swear,\n'As surely as Jehovah is alive!' in truth, justice, and righteousness,\nThen the nations will obtain a blessing for themselves by him,\nAnd in him they will boast.\"\n3 For this is what Jehovah says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem:\n\"Plow for yourselves arable land,\nAnd do not keep sowing among thorns.\n4 Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah,\nAnd remove the foreskins of your hearts,\nYou men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nSo that my wrath may not blaze up like a fire\nAnd burn with no one to extinguish it,\nBecause of your evil deeds.\"\n5 Declare it in Judah, and proclaim it in Jerusalem.\nShout and blow a horn throughout the land.\nCall out loudly and say: \"Gather together,\nAnd let us flee into the fortified cities.\n6 Raise a signal toward Zion.\nSeek shelter, and do not stand still,\"\nFor I am bringing in calamity from the north, a great crash.\n7 He has emerged like a lion from his thicket;\nThe destroyer of nations has set out.\nHe has gone out from his place to make your land an object of horror.\nYour cities will be reduced to ruins, without an inhabitant.\n8 Therefore, put on sackcloth,\nMourn and wail,\nBecause the burning anger of Jehovah has not turned away from us.\n9 \"In that day,\" declares Jehovah, \"the heart of the king will fail him,\nAlso the heart of the princes;\nThe priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be amazed.\"\n10 Then I said: \"Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Truly you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You will have peace,' when the sword is at our throats.\"\n11 At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem:\n\"A scorching wind from the barren hills of the desert\nWill sweep down on the daughter of my people;\nIt is not coming to winnow or to cleanse.\n12 The full wind comes from these places at my bidding.\nNow I will pronounce judgments against them.\n13 Look! He will come like rain clouds,\nAnd his chariots are like a storm wind.\nHis horses are swifter than eagles.\nWoe to us, for we are ruined!\n14 Wash your heart clean of wickedness, O Jerusalem, in order to be saved.\nHow long will you harbor wicked thoughts?\n15 For a voice tells the news from Dan,\nAnd it proclaims disaster from the mountains of Ephraim.\n16 Report it, yes, to the nations;\nProclaim it against Jerusalem.\"\n\"Sentinels are coming from a distant land,\nAnd they will raise their voices against the cities of Judah.\n17 They come against her on all sides like guards of the open field,\nBecause she has rebelled against me,\" declares Jehovah.\n18 \"Your own ways and your actions will be brought upon you.\nHow bitter is your disaster,\nFor it reaches clear to your heart!\"\n19 O my anguish, my anguish!\nI feel great pain in my very heart.\nMy heart pounds within me.\nI cannot keep silent,\nFor I have heard the sound of the horn,\nThe alarm signal of war.\n20 Disaster after disaster has been reported,\nFor the whole land has been destroyed.\nSuddenly my own tents are destroyed,\nIn a moment my tent cloths.\n21 How long will I keep seeing the signal,\nKeep hearing the sound of the horn?\n22 \"For my people are foolish;\nThey take no note of me.\nThey are stupid sons, with no understanding.\nThey are clever enough when it comes to doing bad,\nBut they do not know how to do good.\"\n23 I saw the land, and look! it was empty and desolate.\nI looked at the heavens, and their light was no more.\n24 I saw the mountains, and look! they were quaking,\nAnd the hills were shaking.\n25 I saw, and look! there was no man,\nAnd the birds of the heavens had all fled.\n26 I saw, and look! the orchard had become a wilderness,\nAnd its cities had all been torn down.\nIt was because of Jehovah,\nBecause of his burning anger.\n27 For this is what Jehovah says: \"The whole land will become desolate,\nBut I will not carry out a complete extermination.\n28 For this reason the land will mourn,\nAnd the heavens above will become dark.\nIt is because I have spoken, I have decided,\nAnd I will not change my mind, nor will I turn back from it.\n29 At the sound of the horsemen and the archers,\nThe entire city flees.\nThey enter into the thickets,\nAnd they climb the rocks.\nEvery city is abandoned,\nAnd no man dwells in them.\"\n30 Now that you are devastated, what will you do?\nYou used to clothe yourself with scarlet,\nTo deck yourself with gold ornaments,\nAnd to enlarge your eyes with black paint.\nBut it is in vain that you beautified yourself,\nFor those lusting after you have rejected you;\nThey are now seeking to take your life.\n31 For I have heard the sound like that of a sick woman,\nThe distress like that of a woman giving birth to her first child,\nThe voice of the daughter of Zion who keeps gasping for breath.\nShe says as she spreads out her palms:\n\"Woe to me, for I am exhausted because of the killers!\"\nChapter 5\n1 Roam the streets of Jerusalem.\nLook around and take note.\nSearch her public squares to see\nWhether you can find a man who acts with justice,\nOne who seeks to be faithful,\nAnd I will forgive her.\n2 Even if they say: \"As surely as Jehovah is alive!\"\nThey would still swear to what is false.\n3 O Jehovah, do your eyes not look for faithfulness?\nYou struck them, but it made no impact on them.\nYou exterminated them, but they refused to accept discipline.\nThey made their faces harder than a rock,\nAnd they refused to turn around.\n4 But I said to myself: \"Surely these must be the lowly.\nThey act foolishly, for they do not know the way of Jehovah,\nThe judgment of their God.\n5 I will go to the prominent men and speak with them,\nFor they must have taken note of the way of Jehovah,\nThe judgment of their God.\nBut they had all broken the yoke\nAnd torn apart the restraints.\"\n6 That is why a lion of the forest attacks them,\nA wolf of the desert plains keeps ravaging them,\nA leopard lies awake at their cities.\nEveryone going out from them is torn to pieces.\nFor their transgressions are many;\nTheir acts of unfaithfulness are numerous.\n7 How can I forgive you for this?\nYour sons have abandoned me,\nAnd they swear by what is no God.\nI satisfied their needs,\nBut they kept committing adultery,\nAnd they flocked to the house of a prostitute.\n8 They are like eager, lustful horses,\nEach neighing after another man's wife.\n9 \"Should I not call them to account for these things?\" declares Jehovah.\n\"Should I not avenge myself on such a nation?\"\n10 \"Come up against her vineyard terraces and bring ruin,\nBut do not make a complete extermination.\nTake away her spreading shoots,\nFor they do not belong to Jehovah.\n11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah\nHave been utterly treacherous with me,\" declares Jehovah.\n12 \"They have denied Jehovah, and they keep saying,\n'He will do nothing.\nNo calamity will come upon us;\nWe will not see sword or famine.'\n13 The prophets are full of wind,\nAnd the word is not in them.\nLet this happen to them!\"\n14 Therefore this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, says:\n\"Because these men are saying this,\nHere I am making my words a fire in your mouth,\nAnd this people is the wood,\nAnd it will consume them.\"\n15 \"Here I am bringing in on you a nation from far away, O house of Israel,\" declares Jehovah.\n\"It is an enduring nation.\nIt is an ancient nation,\nA nation whose language you do not know,\nAnd whose speech you cannot understand.\n16 Their quiver is like an open grave;\nAll of them are warriors.\n17 They will devour your harvest and your bread.\nThey will devour your sons and your daughters.\nThey will devour your flocks and your herds.\nThey will devour your vines and your fig trees.\nThey will destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.\"\n18 \"But even in those days,\" declares Jehovah, \"I will not carry out a complete extermination of you. 19 And when they ask, 'Why has Jehovah our God done all these things to us?' you should answer them, 'Just as you abandoned me to serve a foreign god in your land, so you will serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.'\"\n20 Declare this in the house of Jacob,\nAnd proclaim it in Judah, saying:\n21 \"Hear this, you foolish and senseless people:\nThey have eyes but cannot see;\nThey have ears but cannot hear.\n22 'Do you not fear me?' declares Jehovah,\n'Should you not tremble before me?\nIt is I who placed the sand as the boundary for the sea,\nA permanent regulation that it cannot pass over.\nAlthough its waves toss, they cannot prevail;\nAlthough they roar, they still cannot pass beyond it.\n23 But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart;\nThey have turned aside and gone their own way.\n24 And they do not say in their heart:\n\"Let us now fear Jehovah our God,\nThe One who gives the rain in its season,\nBoth the autumn rain and the spring rain,\nThe One who guards for us the appointed weeks of the harvest.\"\n25 Your own errors have prevented these things from coming;\nYour own sins have deprived you of what is good.\n26 For among my people there are wicked men.\nThey keep peering, as when birdcatchers crouch down.\nThey set a deadly trap.\nIt is men whom they catch.\n27 Like a cage full of birds,\nSo their houses are full of deception.\nThat is why they have become powerful and rich.\n28 They have grown fat and smooth;\nThey overflow with evil.\nThey do not plead the legal case of the fatherless,\nThat they may gain success;\nAnd they deny justice to the poor.'\"\n29 \"Should I not call them to account for these things?\" declares Jehovah.\n\"Should I not avenge myself on such a nation?\n30 Something appalling and horrible has occurred in the land:\n31 The prophets prophesy lies,\nAnd the priests dominate by their own authority.\nAnd my own people love it that way.\nBut what will you do when the end comes?\"\nChapter 6\n1 Take shelter, O sons of Benjamin, away from Jerusalem.\nBlow the horn in Tekoa;\nLight a fire signal over Beth-haccherem!\nFor a calamity looms from the north, a great disaster.\n2 The daughter of Zion resembles a beautiful and delicate woman.\n3 The shepherds and their droves will come.\nThey will pitch their tents all around her,\nEach grazing the flock in his care.\n4 \"Prepare for war against her!\nRise up, and let us attack her at midday!\"\n\"Woe to us, for the day is declining,\nFor the shadows of evening are getting longer!\"\n5 \"Rise up, and let us attack during the night\nAnd destroy her fortified towers.\"\n6 For this is what Jehovah of armies says:\n\"Cut down wood and raise up a siege rampart against Jerusalem.\nShe is the city that must be held to account;\nThere is nothing but oppression within her.\n7 As a cistern keeps its water cool,\nSo she keeps her wickedness cool.\nViolence and destruction are heard in her;\nSickness and plague are constantly before me.\n8 Be warned, O Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you in disgust;\nI will make you desolate, a land without inhabitants.\"\n9 This is what Jehovah of armies says:\n\"They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as the last grapes on a vine.\nPass your hand again like one gathering grapes from the vines.\"\n10 \"To whom should I speak and give warning?\nWho will listen?\nLook!

'Is it not they themselves, to their own shame?' 20 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says, 'Look!

So the potter reworked it into another vessel, just as he saw fit.\n5 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 6 \"'Can I not do to you just as this potter did, O house of Israel?' declares Jehovah. 'Look!

Tell them everything that I command you; do not take away a word. 3 Perhaps they will listen and each one will turn back from his evil way, and I will change my mind concerning the calamity that I intend to bring on them because of their evil deeds. 4 Say to them: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'If you will not listen to me by following my law that I have placed before you, 5 by listening to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I am sending to you again and again, whom you have not listened to, 6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city an object of cursing to all the nations of the earth.'\"'\"\n7 And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah. 8 So when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him and said: \"You will surely die. 9 Why have you prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, 'This house will become like Shiloh, and this city will be devastated and left without an inhabitant'?\" And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.\n10 When the princes of Judah heard these words, they came up from the house of the king to the house of Jehovah and sat down at the entrance of the new gate of Jehovah. 11 The priests and the prophets said to the princes and to all the people: \"This man deserves the death penalty, because he has prophesied against this city just as you have heard with your own ears.\"\n12 Jeremiah then said to all the princes and to all the people: \"It was Jehovah who sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. 13 So now, reform your ways and your actions and obey the voice of Jehovah your God, and Jehovah will change his mind concerning the calamity that he has spoken against you. 14 But as for me, I am in your hand. Do to me whatever seems good and right in your eyes. 15 Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon her inhabitants, for in truth Jehovah sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.\"\n16 Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets: \"This man does not deserve the death penalty, for he spoke to us in the name of Jehovah our God.\"\n17 Furthermore, some of the elders of the land rose up and began saying to the entire congregation of the people: 18 \"Micah of Moresheth was prophesying in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, and he said to all the people of Judah, 'This is what Jehovah of armies says:\n\"Zion will be plowed up as a field,\nJerusalem will become heaps of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the House will become like high places in a forest.\"'\n19 \"Did King Hezekiah of Judah and all Judah then put him to death? Did he not fear Jehovah and beg for Jehovah's favor, so that Jehovah changed his mind concerning the calamity that he had spoken against them? So we are about to bring a great calamity on ourselves.\n20 \"And there was another man prophesying in the name of Jehovah, Urijah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land with words like those of Jeremiah. 21 King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words, and the king sought to put him to death. When Urijah heard of it, he at once became afraid and fled to Egypt. 22 Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan the son of Achbor and other men with him to Egypt. 23 They brought Urijah from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who then struck him down with the sword and cast his dead body into the graveyard of the common people.\"\n24 But Ahikam the son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so that he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.\nChapter 27\n1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah: 2 \"This is what Jehovah has told me, 'Make for yourself straps and yoke bars, and put them on your neck. 3 Then send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the messengers who have come to Jerusalem to King Zedekiah of Judah. 4 Give them this command for their masters:\n\"'\"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says; this is what you should say to your masters, 5 'It is I who made the earth, mankind, and the beasts that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I have given it to whomever I please. 6 And now I have given all these lands into the hand of my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon; even the wild beasts of the field I have given him to serve him. 7 All the nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his own land comes, when many nations and great kings will make him their slave.'\n8 \"'\"'If any nation or kingdom refuses to serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and refuses to put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,' declares Jehovah, 'until I have finished them off by his hand.'\n9 \"'\"'Therefore, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your magicians, and your sorcerers, who are saying to you: \"You will not serve the king of Babylon.\" 10 For they are prophesying lies to you, so that you will be taken far away from your land and I will disperse you and you will perish.\n11 \"'\"'But the nation that brings its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will allow to remain on its land,' declares Jehovah, 'to cultivate it and dwell in it.'\"'\"\n12 Also to King Zedekiah of Judah I spoke in the same way, saying: \"Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will keep living. 13 Why should you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as Jehovah has said about the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 14 Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, 'You will not serve the king of Babylon,' because they are prophesying lies to you.\n15 \"'For I have not sent them,' declares Jehovah, 'but they are prophesying lies in my name, with the result that I will disperse you and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.'\"\n16 And to the priests and to all this people I said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you: \"Look!

Why should this city become a ruin? 18 But if they are prophets and if the word of Jehovah is with them, please let them beg Jehovah of armies that the remaining utensils in the house of Jehovah, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not be taken away to Babylon.'\n19 \"For this is what Jehovah of armies says concerning the pillars, the Sea, the carriages, and the remaining utensils that are left in this city, 20 which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take when he took into exile Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, together with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 21 yes, this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the utensils that are left at the house of Jehovah, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 22 '\"To Babylon they will be brought, and there they will remain until the day I turn my attention to them,\" declares Jehovah. \"Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.\"'\"\nChapter 28\n1 In that same year, in the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, the prophet Hananiah the son of Azzur from Gibeon said to me in the house of Jehovah in the presence of the priests and all the people: 2 \"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3 Within two years I am bringing back to this place all the utensils of the house of Jehovah that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from this place and brought to Babylon.'\" 4 \"'And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who have gone to Babylon,' declares Jehovah, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'\"\n5 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of Jehovah. 6 Jeremiah the prophet said: \"Amen! May Jehovah do this! May Jehovah fulfill your words that you prophesied by bringing back from Babylon to this place the utensils of the house of Jehovah and all the exiled people! 7 However, hear, please, this message that I am speaking in your ears and in the ears of all the people. 8 Long ago the prophets who were prior to me and prior to you used to prophesy concerning many lands and great kingdoms, about war, calamity, and pestilence. 9 If a prophet prophesies about peace and the word of that prophet comes true, then it will be known that Jehovah truly sent that prophet.\"\n10 At that Hananiah the prophet took the yoke bar off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it. 11 Hananiah then said in the presence of all the people: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Just like this I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two years.'\" And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.\n12 After Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, this message of Jehovah came to Jeremiah: 13 \"Go and say to Hananiah, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"You have broken yoke bars of wood, but instead of them you will make yoke bars of iron.\" 14 For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"I will put an iron yoke bar on the neck of all these nations, to serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and they must serve him. Even the wild beasts of the field I will give him.\"'\"\n15 Jeremiah the prophet then said to Hananiah the prophet: \"Listen, please, O Hananiah! Jehovah has not sent you, but you have caused this people to trust in a lie. 16 Therefore this is what Jehovah says, 'Look! I am removing you from the face of the ground. This year you will die, for you have urged rebellion against Jehovah.'\"\n17 So Hananiah the prophet died in that year, in the seventh month.\nChapter 29\n1 These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders among the exiled people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, 2 after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen and the metalworkers had gone out of Jerusalem. 3 He sent the letter by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. It said:\n4 \"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiled people, whom I have caused to go into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, 5 'Build houses and live in them.

Become many there, and do not decrease. 7 And seek the peace of the city to which I have exiled you, and pray in its behalf to Jehovah, for in its peace you will have peace. 8 For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they are dreaming. 9 For 'they are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,' declares Jehovah.\"'\"\n10 \"For this is what Jehovah says, 'When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you, and I will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place.'\n11 \"'For I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,' declares Jehovah, 'thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope. 12 And you will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.'\n13 \"'You will seek me and find me, for you will search for me with all your heart. 14 And I will let you find me,' declares Jehovah.

'And I will bring you back to the place from which I caused you to go into exile.'\n15 \"But you have said, 'Jehovah has raised up prophets for us in Babylon.'\n16 \"For this is what Jehovah says to the king sitting on the throne of David and to all the people dwelling in this city, your brothers who have not gone with you into exile, 17 'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"Here I am sending against them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and I will make them like rotten figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.\"'\n18 \"'And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and I will make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, and a curse, and an object of astonishment, something to whistle at, and a reproach among all the nations to which I disperse them, 19 because they have not listened to my words that I sent to them with my servants the prophets,' declares Jehovah, 'sending them again and again.'\n\"'But you have not listened,' declares Jehovah.\n20 \"Therefore, hear the word of Jehovah, all you exiled people, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. 21 This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name, 'Here I am giving them into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and he will strike them down before your eyes. 22 And what happens to them will become a curse spoken by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon: \"May Jehovah make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!\" 23 for they have acted disgracefully in Israel, committing adultery with the wives of their neighbors and speaking false words in my name that I did not command them.\n\"'\"I am the One who knows, and I am a witness,\" declares Jehovah.'\"\n24 \"And to Shemaiah of Nehelam you will say, 25 'This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"Because you sent in your name letters to all the people who are in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, 26 'Jehovah has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest to become the overseer of the house of Jehovah, to be in charge of any madman who acts like a prophet and to put him into the stocks and into the pillory; 27 why, then, have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is acting as a prophet for you? 28 For he even sent to us at Babylon, saying: \"It will be a long time!

You say, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it, 4 and King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans, for he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will speak to him face-to-face and see him eye to eye.\"' 5 'He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he will remain until I turn my attention to him,' declares Jehovah. 'Although you keep fighting against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.'\"\n6 Jeremiah said: \"The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying, 7 'Here Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say: \"Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, because you have the first right to repurchase it.\"'\"\n8 Hanamel the son of my uncle came to me, just as Jehovah had said, into the Courtyard of the Guard, and he said to me: \"Please buy my field in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin, for you have the right to take possession of it and to repurchase it. Buy it for yourself.\" At that I knew that this was by the word of Jehovah.\n9 So I bought the field in Anathoth from Hanamel the son of my uncle. I weighed out the money to him, seven shekels and ten silver pieces. 10 Then I recorded it in a deed, affixed the seal, called in witnesses, and weighed the money in the scales. 11 I took the deed of purchase, the one that was sealed according to the commandment and legal requirements, as well as the one that was left unsealed, 12 and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah in the presence of Hanamel the son of my uncle, the witnesses who wrote in the deed of purchase, and all the Jews who were sitting in the Courtyard of the Guard.\n13 I now commanded Baruch in their presence, saying: 14 \"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'Take these deeds, this deed of purchase, the sealed one and the other deed left unsealed, and put them into an earthenware vessel, so that they may be kept for a long time.' 15 For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.'\"\n16 Then I prayed to Jehovah after giving the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, saying: 17 \"Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Look! You made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. Nothing is too wonderful for you, 18 the One showing loyal love to thousands, but repaying the error of the fathers to their sons after them, the true God, the great and mighty One, whose name is Jehovah of armies. 19 You are great in counsel and mighty in deed, you whose eyes observe all the ways of men, to give to each one according to his ways and according to what he does. 20 You have performed signs and miracles in the land of Egypt, which are known down to this day, and thus you have made a name for yourself in Israel and among mankind, as it is today. 21 And you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt, with signs, with miracles, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with terrifying deeds.\n22 \"In time you gave them this land that you swore to give to their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey. 23 And they came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did not do anything you commanded them to do, so that you caused all this calamity to befall them. 24 Look! Men have come with siege ramparts to capture the city, and because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, the city will certainly fall into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it; what you said has all happened, as you now see. 25 But you have told me, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses,' although the city will certainly be given into the hand of the Chaldeans.\"\n26 At that the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying: 27 \"Here I am, Jehovah, the God of all mankind. Is there anything too wonderful for me? 28 So this is what Jehovah says, 'Here I am handing this city over to the Chaldeans and into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and he will capture it. 29 And the Chaldeans fighting against this city will come in and set this city on fire and burn it down along with the houses on whose roofs the people offered sacrifices to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to offend me.'\n30 \"'For the people of Israel and of Judah have done only what was bad in my eyes, from their youth on; the people of Israel keep offending me by the work of their hands,' declares Jehovah. 31 'For this city, from the day that they built it down to this day, has been nothing but a cause of anger and wrath to me, so that it must be removed from before my face, 32 because of all the evil that the people of Israel and of Judah have done to offend me-they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 33 They kept turning their backs to me, not their faces; although I tried to teach them again and again, none of them would listen to receive discipline. 34 And they put their disgusting idols in the house that bears my name, in order to defile it. 35 Furthermore, they built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, in order to make their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to Molech, something that I had not commanded them and that had never come into my heart to do such a detestable thing, causing Judah to sin.'\n36 \"Therefore this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning this city that you are saying will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, 37 'Here I will gather them together from all the lands where I dispersed them in my anger and in my wrath and in great indignation, and I will bring them back to this place and let them dwell in security. 38 And they will be my people, and I will be their God. 39 And I will give them one heart and one way so that they may always fear me, for their own good and the good of their children after them. 40 And I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, so that they will not turn away from me. 41 I will exult over them to do good to them, and I will firmly plant them in this land, with all my heart and with all my soul.'\"\n42 \"For this is what Jehovah says, 'Just as I have brought on this people all this great calamity, so I will bring on them all the goodness that I am promising them. 43 And fields will again be bought in this land, though you are saying: \"It is a wasteland without man and beast, and it has been handed over to the Chaldeans.\"'\n44 \"'Fields will be bought with money, deeds of purchase will be recorded and sealed, and witnesses will be called in the land of Benjamin, in the areas around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the mountainous region, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south, because I will bring back their captives,' declares Jehovah.\"\nChapter 33\n1 The word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the Courtyard of the Guard, saying: 2 \"This is what Jehovah the Maker of earth says, Jehovah who formed it and firmly established it; Jehovah is his name, 3 'Call to me, and I will answer you and readily tell you great and incomprehensible things that you have not known.'\"\n4 \"For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that are pulled down because of the siege ramparts and the sword, 5 and concerning those who are coming to fight the Chaldeans, filling these places with the carcasses of those whom I struck down in my anger and in my wrath, those whose evil has caused me to hide my face from this city: 6 'Here I am bringing recuperation and health to her, and I will heal them and reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth. 7 And I will bring back the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel, and I will build them up as I did at the start. 8 And I will purify them from all the guilt of their sins against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sins and their transgressions against me. 9 And she will become to me a name of exultation, a praise, and a beauty before all the nations of the earth who will hear of all the goodness that I bestow on them. And they will be in dread and will tremble because of all the goodness and peace that I will bestow on her.'\"\n10 \"This is what Jehovah says: 'In this place that you will say is a wasteland, without man or livestock, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or livestock, there will again be heard 11 the sound of exultation and the sound of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying: \"Give thanks to Jehovah of armies, for Jehovah is good; his loyal love endures forever!\"'\n\"'They will bring thanksgiving offerings into the house of Jehovah, for I will bring back the captives of the land, as at the start,' says Jehovah.\"\n12 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says: 'In this wasteland, without man or livestock, and in all its cities, there will again be pastures for the shepherds to rest their flocks.'\n13 \"'In the cities of the mountainous region, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the south, in the land of Benjamin, in the areas around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hands of the one counting them,' says Jehovah.\"\n14 \"'Look! The days are coming,' declares Jehovah, 'when I will fulfill the good promise that I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah. 15 In those days and at that time I will cause to sprout for David a righteous sprout, and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land. 16 In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will reside in security. And this is what she will be called: Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.'\"\n17 \"For this is what Jehovah says: 'There will never fail to be a man from David's line to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, 18 nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man stand before me to offer whole burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to offer sacrifices.'\"\n19 And the word of Jehovah again came to Jeremiah, saying: 20 \"This is what Jehovah says, 'If you could break my covenant regarding the day and my covenant regarding the night, to prevent day and night from coming at their proper time, 21 only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken, so that he should not have a son ruling as king on his throne, and so also my covenant with the Levitical priests, my ministers. 22 Just as the army of the heavens cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of my servant David and the Levites who are ministering to me.'\"\n23 And the word of Jehovah again came to Jeremiah, saying: 24 \"Have you not taken note of what this people is saying, 'Jehovah will reject the two families that he chose'? And they are treating my own people with disrespect, and they no longer regard them as a nation.\n25 \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Just as surely as I have established my covenant regarding the day and the night, the laws of heaven and earth, 26 so I will never reject the offspring of Jacob and of my servant David, so as not to take from his offspring rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will gather back their captives and have pity on them.'\"\nChapter 34\n1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all her cities:\n2 \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'Go and speak to King Zedekiah of Judah and tell him: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Here I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire. 3 And you will not escape out of his hand, for you will without fail be caught and handed over to him. And you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak to you face-to-face, and you will go to Babylon.' 4 However, hear the word of Jehovah, O King Zedekiah of Judah, 'This is what Jehovah says concerning you: \"You will not die by the sword. 5 In peace you will die, and they will make a burning ceremony for you as they did for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, and they will mourn you, 'Alas, O master!' for 'I have spoken the word,' declares Jehovah.\"'\"'\"\n6 Jeremiah the prophet then spoke all these words to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem, 7 when the armies of the king of Babylon were fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for they were the only fortified cities that remained of the cities of Judah.\n8 The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them, 9 that everyone should free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one would keep a fellow Jew as his slave. 10 So all the princes and all the people obeyed. They had entered into the covenant that everyone should free his male and female slaves and not keep them as slaves any longer. They obeyed and let them go. 11 However, they later brought back the male and female slaves whom they had freed, and they again forced them back into slavery. 12 So the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying:\n13 \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'I made a covenant with your forefathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying: 14 \"At the end of seven years, each of you should free his Hebrew brother who was sold to you and who has served you six years; you must set him free.\" But your forefathers did not listen or incline their ears to me. 15 And recently you yourselves turned around and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty to your fellow men, and you made a covenant before me in the house that bears my name. 16 But then you turned around and profaned my name by bringing back your male and female slaves whom you had freed according to their desire, and you forced them back into slavery.'\n17 \"Therefore this is what Jehovah says: 'You have not obeyed me in proclaiming liberty, each one to his brother and to his fellow man. So I will now proclaim liberty to you,' declares Jehovah, 'to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, and I will make you an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. 18 And this is what will happen to the men who violated my covenant by not carrying out the words of the covenant that they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between the halves, 19 namely, the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the halves of the calf: 20 I will hand them over to their enemies and to those seeking to take their lives, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth. 21 And I will give King Zedekiah of Judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking to take their lives and into the hand of the armies of the king of Babylon, who are withdrawing from against you.'\n22 \"'Here I will give the order,' declares Jehovah, 'and I will bring them back to this city, and they will fight against it and capture it and burn it with fire; and the cities of Judah I will make a wasteland, without an inhabitant.'\"\nChapter 35\n1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying: 2 \"Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the dining rooms; then offer them wine to drink.\"\n3 So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah the son of Habazziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and the entire house of the Rechabites 4 into the house of Jehovah. I brought them to the dining room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of the true God, which was next to the dining room of the princes that was above the dining room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum the doorkeeper. 5 Then I put cups and goblets full of wine before the men of the house of the Rechabites and said to them: \"Drink wine.\"\n6 But they said: \"We will not drink wine, because Jehonadab the son of Rechab, our forefather, gave us this command, 'Neither you nor your sons must ever drink wine. 7 And you must not build a house, sow seed, or plant or obtain a vineyard. Instead, you must always dwell in tents, so that you may live for a long time in the land where you are residing as foreigners.' 8 So we continue to obey the voice of Jehonadab the son of our forefather Rechab in all that he commanded us, by never drinking any wine-we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters. 9 And we do not build houses to dwell in, nor do we have vineyards or fields or seed. 10 We keep living in tents and obeying all that Jehonadab our forefather commanded us. 11 But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come, let us go into Jerusalem to escape the army of the Chaldeans and of the Syrians,' and now we are living in Jerusalem.\"\n12 And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying: 13 \"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'Go and say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: \"Were you not continually urged to obey my words?\" declares Jehovah. 14 \"Jehonadab the son of Rechab commanded his descendants not to drink wine, and they have carried out his words by not drinking it to this day, thus obeying the order of their forefather. However, I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not obeyed me. 15 And I kept sending all my servants the prophets to you, sending them again and again, saying, 'Turn back, please, each of you from your evil ways, and do what is right! Do not walk after other gods and serve them. Then you will keep dwelling in the land that I gave to you and your forefathers.' But you did not incline your ear or listen to me. 16 The descendants of Jehonadab the son of Rechab have carried out the order that their forefather gave them, but these people have not listened to me.\"'\"\n17 \"Therefore this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Here I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the calamity that I have warned them about, for I have spoken to them, but they would not listen, and I kept calling to them, but they would not answer.'\"\n18 And Jeremiah said to the household of the Rechabites: \"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'Because you have obeyed the order of your forefather Jehonadab and you continue to observe all his orders, doing exactly what he ordered you, 19 this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"There will never fail to be a descendant of Jehonadab the son of Rechab to serve in my presence.\"'\"\nChapter 36\n1 Now in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying: 2 \"Take a scroll and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the first day I spoke to you in the days of Josiah to this day. 3 Perhaps when those of the house of Judah hear of all the calamity that I intend to bring on them, they may turn back from their evil ways, so that I may forgive their error and their sin.\"\n4 Jeremiah then called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Jeremiah dictated all the words that Jehovah had spoken to him, and Baruch wrote them in the scroll. 5 Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch: \"I am confined and unable to enter the house of Jehovah. 6 So you are the one who must go in and read aloud the words of Jehovah from the scroll that you wrote at my dictation. Read them in the hearing of the people at the house of Jehovah on the day of a fast; thus you will read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their cities. 7 Perhaps their request for favor will reach Jehovah, and they will turn back, each one from his evil ways, for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah has declared against this people.\"\n8 So Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him; he read aloud from the scroll the words of Jehovah at the house of Jehovah.\n9 Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came into Jerusalem from the cities of Judah proclaimed a fast before Jehovah. 10 Baruch then read aloud from the scroll the words of Jeremiah at the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the copyist, in the upper courtyard, at the entrance of the new gate of the house of Jehovah, in the hearing of all the people.\n11 When Micaiah the son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan heard all the words of Jehovah from the scroll, 12 he went down to the house of the king, to the secretary's chamber. All the princes were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other princes. 13 Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.\n14 Then all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah the son of Shelemiah the son of Cushi to Baruch, saying: \"Come and bring with you the scroll from which you read in the hearing of the people.\" Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went in to them. 15 They said to him: \"Sit down, please, and read it aloud to us.\" So Baruch read it to them.\n16 Now as soon as they heard all the words, they looked at one another in dread, and they said to Baruch: \"We must certainly tell the king all these words.\" 17 And they asked Baruch: \"Tell us, please, how you wrote all these words. Was it at his dictation?\" 18 Baruch replied to them: \"He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them down with ink in this scroll.\" 19 The princes said to Baruch: \"Go and hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.\"\n20 Then they went in to the king, to the courtyard, and deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they told the king everything they had heard.\n21 So the king sent Jehudi out to get the scroll, and he brought it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. Jehudi began to read it in the hearing of the king and of all the princes standing by the king. 22 The king was sitting in the winter house, in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him. 23 After Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king would cut off that portion with the secretary's knife and pitch it into the fire that was burning in the brazier, until the entire scroll ended up in the fire that was in the brazier. 24 And they felt no dread; neither the king nor all his servants who heard all these words ripped their garments apart. 25 Although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he did not listen to them. 26 Further, the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of the king, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but Jehovah kept them concealed.\n27 And the word of Jehovah again came to Jeremiah after the king had burned up the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, saying: 28 \"Take another scroll and write on it all the same words that were on the first scroll, which King Jehoiakim of Judah burned up. 29 And you should say against King Jehoiakim of Judah, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"You have burned up this scroll and said, 'Why have you written on it: \"The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and empty it of man and beast\"?' 30 Therefore this is what Jehovah says against King Jehoiakim of Judah, 'He will have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body will be left exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. 31 I will call him and his descendants and his servants to account for their error, and I will bring on them and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem and on the men of Judah all the calamity that I have spoken against them, but they did not listen.'\"'\"\n32 Jeremiah then took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary, and at Jeremiah's dictation he wrote on it all the words of the scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire. And many more words like those were added.\nChapter 37\n1 And King Zedekiah the son of Josiah began to reign in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made him king in the land of Judah. 2 But he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Jehovah spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.\n3 And King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to Jeremiah the prophet, saying: \"Please pray in our behalf to Jehovah our God.\" 4 Jeremiah was moving about freely among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison. 5 Now Pharaoh's army had set out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them. So they withdrew from against Jerusalem. 6 Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying: 7 \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'This is what you should say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: \"Look! The army of Pharaoh that is coming to assist you will have to go back to its land, Egypt. 8 And the Chaldeans will come back and fight against this city and capture it and burn it with fire.\" 9 This is what Jehovah says, \"Do not deceive yourselves by saying, 'The Chaldeans will surely go away from against us,' because they will not go away. 10 Even if you were to strike down the entire army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you and only their wounded men were left, they would still rise up from their tents and burn this city with fire.\"'\"\n11 When the Chaldean army had withdrawn from against Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army, 12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among his people. 13 But when he reached the Gate of Benjamin, the officer in charge of the guard, whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet and said: \"You are deserting to the Chaldeans!\" 14 But Jeremiah said: \"It is not true! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.\" But he did not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him in to the princes. 15 The princes were furious with Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jehonathan the secretary, which had been made into a prison. 16 Jeremiah was put into the dungeon, into the vaulted rooms, and he remained there many days.\n17 Then King Zedekiah sent for him, and the king secretly questioned him in his house. He asked, \"Is there any word from Jehovah?\" Jeremiah said, \"There is!\" and he continued, \"You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon!\"\n18 Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah: \"How have I sinned against you and against your servants and against this people, so that you have put me into the prison? 19 Where, now, are your prophets who prophesied to you, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'? 20 Now listen, please, O my lord the king. May you grant, please, my request for favor. Do not send me back to the house of Jehonathan the secretary, or I will die there.\" 21 So King Zedekiah ordered that Jeremiah be put in custody in the Courtyard of the Guard, and he was given a round loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers until all the bread in the city was gone. And Jeremiah remained in the Courtyard of the Guard.\nChapter 38\n1 Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying: 2 \"This is what Jehovah says, 'The one who remains in this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. But the one who surrenders to the Chaldeans will keep living and will have his life as a spoil and live.' 3 This is what Jehovah says, 'This city will surely be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'\"\n4 The princes said to the king: \"Please have this man put to death, for this is how he is weakening the morale of the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as that of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man seeks, not the peace of this people, but their calamity.\" 5 King Zedekiah replied: \"Look! He is in your hands, for the king cannot do anything to stop you.\"\n6 So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchijah the son of the king, which was in the Courtyard of the Guard. They let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now there was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah began to sink down into the mud.\n7 Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin, 8 so Ebed-melech went out of the king's house and spoke to the king, saying: 9 \"O my lord the king, what these men have done to Jeremiah the prophet is evil! They have thrown him into the cistern, and he will die there because of the famine, for there is no bread left in the city.\"\n10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian: \"Take 30 men with you from here, and pull Jeremiah the prophet up out of the cistern before he dies.\" 11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went into the king's house to a place beneath the treasury, and they took from there some worn-out rags and worn-out pieces of cloth and let them down by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. 12 Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah: \"Please put the rags and the pieces of cloth between your armpits and the ropes.\" Jeremiah did so, 13 and they drew Jeremiah out with the ropes and pulled him up out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the Courtyard of the Guard.\n14 King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet to come to him at the third entrance, which is in the house of Jehovah, and the king said to Jeremiah: \"I have something to ask of you. Do not hide anything from me.\" 15 Jeremiah then said to Zedekiah: \"If I tell you, you will certainly put me to death. And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.\" 16 So King Zedekiah secretly swore to Jeremiah, saying: \"As surely as Jehovah is alive, who has given us this life, I will not put you to death, and I will not hand you over to these men who are seeking to take your life.\"\n17 Jeremiah then said to Zedekiah: \"This is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'If you surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will be spared. 18 But if you will not surrender to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape out of their hand.'\"\n19 Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah: \"I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, for if I am handed over to them, they may deal cruelly with me.\" 20 But Jeremiah said: \"You will not be handed over to them. Obey, please, the voice of Jehovah in what I am telling you, and it will go well with you, and you will continue to live. 21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is what Jehovah has revealed to me: 22 Look! All the women remaining in the house of the king of Judah are being brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon, and they are saying,\n'The men whom you trusted have deceived you and overcome you.\nThey have caused your foot to sink into the mud.\nNow they have turned away in retreat.'\n23 And all your wives and your sons they are bringing out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape out of their hand, but you will be seized by the king of Babylon, and because of you this city will be burned with fire.\"\n24 Zedekiah then said to Jeremiah: \"Do not let anyone know about these things, so that you do not die. 25 And if the princes hear that I have spoken with you and they come and say to you, 'Tell us, please, what you said to the king. Do not hide anything from us, and we will not put you to death. What did the king say to you?' 26 you must answer them, 'I was making a request of the king, that he not send me back to the house of Jehonathan to die there.'\"\n27 In time all the princes came in to Jeremiah and questioned him. He told them everything that the king had commanded him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard the conversation. 28 Until the day that Jerusalem was captured, Jeremiah remained in the Courtyard of the Guard; he was still there when Jerusalem was captured.\nChapter 39\n1 In the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem, and they besieged it.\n2 In the 11th year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, they broke through the city wall. 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon went in and sat down in the Middle Gate, namely, Nergal-sharezer the Samgar, Nebo-sarsechim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.\n4 When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city by night by way of the king's garden, through the gate between the double wall, and they continued by the way of the Arabah. 5 But the Chaldean army chased after them, and they overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho. They captured him and brought him up to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed sentence on him. 6 The king of Babylon had the sons of Zedekiah slaughtered before his eyes there at Riblah, and the king of Babylon had all the nobles of Judah slaughtered. 7 Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah, after which he bound him with copper fetters to bring him to Babylon.\n8 The Chaldeans then burned down the king's house and the houses of the people, and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem. 9 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to him, and anyone who remained.\n10 But Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people, those who had nothing at all. On that day he also gave them vineyards and fields to work.\n11 Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard these orders concerning Jeremiah: 12 \"Take him and look after him; do him no harm, and grant whatever he asks of you.\"\n13 So Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the principal men of the king of Babylon sent 14 and had Jeremiah taken out of the Courtyard of the Guard and handed him over to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan to be brought to his house. So he lived among the people.\n15 While Jeremiah was confined in the Courtyard of the Guard, the word of Jehovah came to him, saying: 16 \"Go and tell Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, 'This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"Here I am fulfilling my words on this city for calamity and not for good, and in that day you will see it happen.\"'\n17 \"'But I will rescue you in that day,' declares Jehovah, 'and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.'\n18 \"'For I will surely provide you with escape, and you will not fall by the sword. You will have your life as a spoil, because you trusted in me,' declares Jehovah.\"\nChapter 40\n1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah after Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard let him go free from Ramah. He had taken him there bound with handcuffs, and he was among all the exiles of Jerusalem and of Judah who were being deported to Babylon. 2 Then the chief of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him: \"Jehovah your God foretold this calamity against this place, 3 and Jehovah has brought it about just as he said, because you people sinned against Jehovah and did not obey his voice. That is why this has happened to you. 4 Now I am releasing you today from the handcuffs that were on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if you do not want to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See! The entire land is before you. Go wherever you choose.\"\n5 While Jeremiah still had not turned back, Nebuzaradan said: \"Return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you choose.\"\nThe chief of the guard then gave him a food allowance and a gift and let him go. 6 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.\n7 In time all the army chiefs who were in the field with their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land and that he had appointed him over the men, women, and children from the poor people of the land who had not been deported to Babylon. 8 So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They were Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, together with their men. 9 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore an oath to them and to their men, saying: \"Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. 10 As for me, I will stay in Mizpah to represent you to the Chaldeans who come to us. But you should gather wine, summer fruits, and oil and put them in your storage containers and settle in the cities that you have taken over.\"\n11 And all the Jews who were in Moab, Ammon, and Edom, as well as those who were in all the other lands, also heard that the king of Babylon had let a remnant stay in Judah and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan. 12 So all the Jews began returning from all the places to which they had been dispersed, and they came into the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in very great quantity.\n13 Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs who were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 14 They said to him: \"Do you not know that Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to kill you?\" But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.\n15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah secretly told Gedaliah in Mizpah: \"I want to go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know. Why should he kill you, and why should all the people of Judah who have gathered to you be scattered and the remnant of Judah perish?\" 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah: \"Do not do this, for what you are saying concerning Ishmael is a lie.\"\nChapter 41\n1 In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, who was of the royal line and one of the principal men of the king, came with ten other men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah. As they were eating a meal together in Mizpah, 2 Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword. So he put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. 3 Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with Gedaliah in Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.\n4 On the second day after Gedaliah had been put to death, before anyone knew about it, 5 there came 80 men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria. Their beards were shaved off, their garments were ripped apart, they had cut themselves, and they had grain offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring to the house of Jehovah. 6 So Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked along. When he encountered them, he said to them: \"Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.\" 7 But when they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and his men slaughtered them and threw them into the cistern.\n8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael: \"Do not put us to death, for we have hidden stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.\" So he refrained from putting them to death along with their brothers. 9 Now Ishmael threw all the carcasses of the men he had killed into a great cistern, the one that King Asa had made because of King Baasha of Israel. This was the cistern that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled with the slain men.\n10 Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people in Mizpah, including the daughters of the king and all the people left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard had put in the custody of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and went off to cross over to the Ammonites.\n11 When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs who were with him heard about all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 12 they took all the men and went off to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and they found him by the great waters in Gibeon.\n13 All the people who were with Ishmael rejoiced when they saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs with him. 14 Then all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and went back with Johanan the son of Kareah. 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and went to the Ammonites.\n16 Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs who were with him took with them the rest of the people from Mizpah, those whom they had rescued from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. They brought the men, the soldiers, the women, the children, and the court officials back from Gibeon. 17 So they went and stayed in the lodging place of Chimham next to Bethlehem, intending to go on into Egypt 18 because of the Chaldeans. For they had become afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.\nChapter 42\n1 Then all the army chiefs, and Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least to the greatest, approached 2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet: \"Hear, please, our request for favor, and pray in our behalf to Jehovah your God, in behalf of all this remnant, for just a few of many are left, as you can see. 3 May Jehovah your God tell us the way we should walk and what we should do.\"\n4 Jeremiah the prophet replied to them: \"I have heard you, and I am praying to Jehovah your God according to your request; and every word that Jehovah answers you, I will tell you. I will not hold back a word from you.\"\n5 They replied to Jeremiah: \"May Jehovah be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not do exactly as Jehovah your God instructs us through you. 6 Whether good or bad, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us because we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.\"\n7 Now ten days later the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah. 8 So he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and for all the army chiefs who were with him and for all the people, from the least to the greatest. 9 He said to them: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, to whom you sent me to present your request for favor before him: 10 'If you will indeed remain in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you, for I will feel regret over the calamity I have caused you. 11 Do not be afraid because of the king of Babylon, whom you fear.'\n\"'Do not be afraid because of him,' declares Jehovah, 'for I am with you, to save you and to rescue you out of his hand. 12 And I will show you mercy, and he will have mercy on you and return you to your own land.\n13 \"'But if you say, \"No, we will not remain in this land!\" and you disobey the voice of Jehovah your God 14 by saying, \"No, we will go instead to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the horn or hunger for bread; there is where we will live,\" 15 then hear the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah. This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"If you are absolutely determined to go to Egypt and you go there to reside, 16 then the very sword you are afraid of will catch up with you there in the land of Egypt, and the very famine you fear will follow after you to Egypt, and there you will die. 17 And all the men who are determined to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. None of them will survive or escape the calamity that I will bring on them.\"'\n18 \"For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Just as my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt, and you will become a curse, an object of horror, a malediction, and a reproach, and you will never again see this place.'\n19 \"Jehovah has spoken against you, O remnant of Judah. Do not go to Egypt. You should know for a certainty that I have warned you today 20 that your error will cost you your lives. For you sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, 'Pray in our behalf to Jehovah our God, and tell us everything that Jehovah our God says, and we will do it.' 21 And I told you today, but you will not obey the voice of Jehovah your God or do anything he sent me to tell you. 22 Therefore, know for a certainty that by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence you will die in the place where you desire to go and reside.\"\nChapter 43\n1 When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all these words from Jehovah their God, every single word that Jehovah their God had sent him to tell them, 2 Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the presumptuous men said to Jeremiah: \"What you are saying is a lie! Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, 'Do not go to Egypt to reside there.' 3 But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans, to put us to death or to take us into exile in Babylon.\"\n4 So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs and all the people disobeyed the voice of Jehovah to remain in the land of Judah. 5 Instead, Johanan the son of Kareah and all the army chiefs took with them all the remnant of Judah who had returned to reside in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been dispersed. 6 They took the men, the women, the children, the daughters of the king, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. 7 And they went into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of Jehovah, and they went as far as Tahpanhes.\n8 Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying: 9 \"Take in your hand large stones, and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace at the entrance of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, with the Jewish men looking on. 10 Then say to them, 'This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: \"Here I am sending for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will place his throne right above these stones that I have hidden, and he will extend his royal tent over them. 11 And he will come in and strike the land of Egypt. Whoever is meant for deadly plague will be for deadly plague, and whoever is meant for captivity will be for captivity, and whoever is meant for the sword will be for the sword. 12 And I will set the houses of the gods of Egypt on fire, and he will burn them and lead them captive. He will wrap the land of Egypt around himself just as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment, and he will depart from there in peace. 13 And he will break to pieces the pillars of Beth-shemesh in the land of Egypt, and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.\"'\"\nChapter 44\n1 The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and the land of Pathros, saying: 2 \"This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'You have seen all the calamity that I brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah, and today they are in ruins, without an inhabitant. 3 It is because of the evil things that they did to offend me by going and making sacrifices and serving other gods whom they had not known, neither you nor your forefathers. 4 I kept sending all my servants the prophets to you, sending them again and again, saying: \"Please do not do this detestable thing that I hate.\" 5 But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn back from their evil by not making sacrifices to other gods. 6 So my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a ruin and a wasteland, as they are today.'\n7 \"And now this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'Why are you causing a great calamity to yourselves, so that every man and woman, child and infant, will perish from Judah, leaving you without a remnant? 8 Why should you offend me with the works of your hands by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to reside? You will perish and become an object of cursing and a reproach among all the nations of the earth. 9 Have you forgotten the wicked deeds of your forefathers and the wicked deeds of the kings of Judah and the wicked deeds of their wives, as well as your own wicked deeds and the wicked deeds of your wives, that were done in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 10 Down to this day they have not humbled themselves, they have shown no fear, nor have they walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and your forefathers.'\n11 \"Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'Here I am determined to bring calamity on you, to destroy all Judah. 12 And I will take the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all perish in the land of Egypt. They will fall by the sword and perish by the famine; from the least to the greatest, they will die by the sword and by famine. And they will become a curse, an object of horror, a malediction, and a reproach. 13 I will punish those dwelling in the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence. 14 And the remnant of Judah who have gone to reside in the land of Egypt will not escape or survive to return to the land of Judah. They will long to return and dwell there, but they will not return, except for a few escapees.'\"\n15 All the men who knew that their wives had been making sacrifices to other gods and all the wives who were standing there, who formed a large group, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah: 16 \"We will not listen to the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah. 17 Instead, we will surely carry out every word that our mouths have spoken, to make sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her, just as we, our forefathers, our kings, and our princes did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem when we were satisfied with bread and were well-off, when we saw no calamity at all. 18 From the time we quit making sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have perished by the sword and by the famine.\"\n19 The women added: \"And when we were making sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without the consent of our husbands that we made sacrificial cakes shaped in her image and we poured out drink offerings to her?\"\n20 Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and their wives and to all the people who were speaking to him: 21 \"The sacrifices that you, your forefathers, your kings, your princes, and the people of the land made in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem-Jehovah remembered them and they came up into his heart! 22 Finally Jehovah could no longer put up with your evil practices and the detestable things you had done, and your land became a devastated place, an object of horror and cursing, without an inhabitant, as it is today. 23 It is because you have made these sacrifices and because you have sinned against Jehovah by not obeying the voice of Jehovah and following his law, his statutes, and his reminders that this calamity has come upon you, as is the case today.\"\n24 Jeremiah continued to say to all the people and to all the women: \"Hear the word of Jehovah, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt. 25 This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says, 'What you and your wives have spoken with your mouths, you have fulfilled with your hands, for you said: \"We will surely carry out our vows to make sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.\" You women will surely carry out your vows and perform your vows.'\n26 \"Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, all you of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt: '\"Here I swear by my own great name,\" says Jehovah, \"that my name will no longer be called on in an oath by any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt who says, 'As surely as the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is alive!' 27 Now I am watching over them to bring calamity and not something good; all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine, until they cease to exist. 28 Only a few will escape the sword and return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah. Then all the remnant of Judah who came to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word has come true, mine or theirs!\"'\"\n29 \"'And this is the sign for you,' declares Jehovah, 'that I will punish you in this place, so that you will know that my words promising calamity against you will surely come true. 30 This is what Jehovah says: \"Here I am giving Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies and of those seeking to take his life, just as I gave King Zedekiah of Judah into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was his enemy and who sought to take his life.\"'\"\nChapter 45\n1 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah when he wrote in a book these words dictated by Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah:\n2 \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning you, Baruch, 3 'You have said: \"Woe to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain! I am weary from my groaning, and I have found no resting-place.\"'\n4 \"You should say to him, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting-the entire land. 5 But you are seeking great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.\"'\n\"'For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh,' declares Jehovah, 'and wherever you may go, I will grant you your life as a spoil.'\"\nChapter 46\n1 This is the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations: 2 For Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Necho the king of Egypt, who was along the Euphrates River and was defeated at Carchemish by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah:\n3 \"Prepare your bucklers and large shields,\nAnd advance to the battle.\n4 Harness the horses and mount, you horsemen.\nTake your positions and put on your helmets.\nPolish the lances and put on your coats of mail.\n5 'Why do I see them terror-stricken?\nThey are retreating, their warriors are crushed.\nThey have fled in panic, their warriors have not turned around.\nThere is terror all around,' declares Jehovah.\n6 'The swift cannot flee, and the warriors cannot escape.\nIn the north, by the bank of the Euphrates River,\nThey have stumbled and fallen.'\n7 Who is this coming up like the Nile River,\nLike the rivers of surging waters?\n8 Egypt comes up just like the Nile River,\nLike rivers of surging waters,\nAnd it says, 'I will go up and cover the earth.\nI will destroy the city and those inhabiting it.'\n9 Go up, you horses!\nDrive madly, you chariots!\nLet the warriors advance,\nCush and Put, who handle the shield,\nAnd the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.\n10 \"That day belongs to the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, the day of vengeance for taking revenge on his adversaries.

First the king of Assyria devoured them; then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gnawed on their bones. 18 Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: 'Here I will deal with the king of Babylon and with his land in the same way that I dealt with the king of Assyria. 19 And I will bring Israel back to his pasture, and he will graze on Carmel and on Bashan, and on the mountains of Ephraim and of Gilead he will be satisfied.'\"\n20 \"In those days and at that time,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"Israel's guilt will be searched for,\nBut there will be none,\nAnd the sins of Judah will not be found,\nFor I will forgive those whom I let remain.\"\n21 \"Go up against the land of Merathaim and against the inhabitants of Pekod.\nLet them be massacred and completely destroyed,\" declares Jehovah.\n\"Do all that I have commanded you.\n22 There is the sound of war in the land,\nA great catastrophe.\n23 How the forge hammer of all the earth has been cut down and broken!\nHow Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!\n24 I have laid a snare for you, and you have been caught, O Babylon,\nAnd you did not know it.\nYou were found and captured,\nFor it was Jehovah whom you opposed.\n25 Jehovah has opened his storehouse,\nAnd he brings out the weapons of his indignation.\nFor the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has a work\nIn the land of the Chaldeans.\n26 Come against her from distant places.\nOpen up her granaries.\nPile her up like heaps of grain.\nDestroy her completely.\nMay she have no one left.\n27 Massacre all her young bulls;\nLet them go down to the slaughter.\nWoe to them, for their day has come,\nTheir time of reckoning!\n28 There is the sound of those fleeing,\nThose escaping from the land of Babylon,\nTo declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God,\nThe vengeance for his temple.\n29 Summon archers against Babylon,\nAll who are bending the bow.\nCamp all around her; let no one escape.\nRepay her according to her activity.\nDo to her just as she has done.\nFor she has acted arrogantly against Jehovah,\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\n30 So her young men will fall in her public squares,\nAnd all her soldiers will perish in that day,\" declares Jehovah.\n31 \"Look! I am against you, O defiant one,\" declares the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,\n\"For your day must come, the time that I will call you to account.\n32 You, O defiant one, will stumble and fall,\nWith no one to raise you up.\nAnd I will set your cities on fire,\nAnd it will consume everything around you.\"\n33 This is what Jehovah of armies says:\n\"The people of Israel and Judah are oppressed,\nAnd all those taking them captive have held onto them.\nThey have refused to let them go.\n34 But their Repurchaser is strong.\nJehovah of armies is his name.\nHe will surely plead their legal case,\nIn order to give rest to the land\nAnd to bring agitation to the inhabitants of Babylon.\"\n35 \"There is a sword against the Chaldeans,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"Against the inhabitants of Babylon and against her princes and against her wise ones.\n36 There is a sword against the empty talkers, and they will act foolishly.\nThere is a sword against her warriors, and they will become terrified.\n37 There is a sword against their horses and their war chariots,\nAnd against all the mixed populations in her midst,\nAnd they will become like women.\nThere is a sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered.\n38 There is a devastation on her waters, and they will be dried up.\nFor it is a land of graven images,\nAnd because of their frightful visions they keep acting with madness.\n39 Therefore, the desert creatures will dwell with the howling animals,\nAnd in her the ostriches will dwell.\nShe will never again be inhabited,\nNor will she be a place of residence throughout all generations.\"\n40 \"Just as with God's overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and of their neighboring towns,\" declares Jehovah, \"no one will dwell there, and no man will settle there.\n41 Look! A people is coming in from the north;\nA great nation and grand kings will be raised up\nFrom the remotest parts of the earth.\n42 Bow and javelin they wield.\nThey are cruel and will show no mercy.\nTheir sound is like the roaring sea,\nAs they ride on their horses.\nLike one man, they line up in battle formation against you, O daughter of Babylon.\n43 The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,\nAnd his hands drop down.\nAnguish seizes him,\nPain like that of a woman giving birth.\n44 \"Look! Someone will come up against the secure pastures like a lion from the dense thickets along the Jordan, but in a moment I will make them run away from her. And I will appoint over her the chosen one. For who is like me, and who will challenge me? What shepherd can stand before me? 45 Therefore hear, O men, the decision that Jehovah has made against Babylon and what he has thought out against the land of the Chaldeans.\nSurely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away.\nHe will make their dwelling place desolate because of them.\n46 At the sound of Babylon's capture, the earth will quake,\nAnd an outcry will be heard among the nations.\"\nChapter 51\n1 This is what Jehovah says:\n\"Here I am raising up a destructive wind\nAgainst Babylon and the inhabitants of Leb-kamai.\n2 I will send winnowers to Babylon,\nAnd they will winnow her and make her land empty;\nThey will come against her on all sides in the day of calamity.\n3 Let the archer not bend his bow.\nAnd let no one stand up in his coat of mail.\nShow no compassion for her young men.\nDevote all her army to destruction.\n4 And they will fall slain in the land of the Chaldeans,\nPierced through in her streets.\n5 For Israel and Judah are not widowed from their God, from Jehovah of armies.\nBut their land is full of guilt from the standpoint of the Holy One of Israel.\n6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon,\nAnd escape for your life.\nDo not perish because of her error.\nFor it is the time for Jehovah's vengeance.\nHe is paying her back for what she has done.\n7 Babylon has been a golden cup in the hand of Jehovah;\nShe made all the earth drunk.\nFrom her wine the nations have drunk;\nThat is why the nations have gone mad.\n8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and is broken.\nWail over her!\nGet balsam for her pain; perhaps she may be healed.\"\n9 \"We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed.\nLeave her and let us go, each to his own land.\nFor her judgment has reached to the heavens;\nIt is as high as the clouds.\n10 Jehovah has brought about justice for us.\nCome, let us recount in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.\"\n11 \"Polish the arrows; take up the circular shields.\nJehovah has stirred up the spirit of the

the guard, post the watchmen.\nPrepare those in ambush.\nFor Jehovah has devised the strategy,\nAnd he will carry out what he has promised against the inhabitants of Babylon.\"\n13 \"O woman who resides on many waters,\nWith abundant treasures,\nYour end has come, the limit of your profit-making.\n14 Jehovah of armies has sworn by himself,\n'I will fill you with men, as numerous as

meet another messenger,\nTo report to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured on every side,\n32 That the fords have been seized,\nThat the papyrus boats have been burned with fire,\nAnd

let my blood come upon the inhabitants of Chaldea!' says Jerusalem.\"\n36 Therefore this is what Jehovah says:\n\"Here I am pleading your legal case,\nAnd I will execute vengeance for you.\nI will dry up her sea and make her wells dry.\n37 And Babylon will become piles of stones,\nA lair of jackals,\nAn object of horror and something to whistle at,\nWithout an inhabitant.\n38 All together they will

\"Not only did Babylon cause the slain of Israel to fall\nBut also at Babylon the slain ones of all the earth have fallen.\n50 You who escape the sword, keep going, do not stand still!\nRemember Jehovah from far away,\nAnd may Jerusalem come up into your heart.\"\n51 \"We have been put to shame, for we have heard taunts.\nHumiliation has covered our faces,\nFor foreigners have come against

wounded will groan.\"\n53 \"Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens,\nEven if she should fortify her towering strongholds,\nFrom me her destroyers will come,\" declares Jehovah.\n54 \"Listen! There is an outcry from Babylon,\nThe sound of great disaster from the land of the Chaldeans,\n55 For Jehovah is destroying Babylon,\nHe will silence her great voice,\nAnd their waves will roar like many waters.\nThe sound of their voice will be heard.\n56 For the destroyer will come upon Babylon;\nHer warriors will be captured,\nTheir bows will be shattered,\nFor Jehovah is a God of retribution.\nHe will surely repay.\n57 I will make her princes and her wise men drunk,\nHer governors and her deputy rulers and her warriors,\nAnd they will sleep a lasting sleep,\nFrom which they will not wake up,\" declares the King, whose name is Jehovah of armies.\n58 This is what Jehovah of armies says:\n\"The wall of Babylon, though broad, will be completely demolished,\nAnd her gates, though high, will be set on fire.\nThe peoples will toil for nothing;\nThe nations will weary themselves just to feed the fire.\"\n59 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet gave as a command to Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah when he went with King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign; Seraiah was the quartermaster. 60 Jeremiah wrote in one book all the calamity that would come upon Babylon, all these words written against Babylon. 61 Furthermore, Jeremiah said to Seraiah: \"When you come to Babylon and see her, you must read aloud all these words. 62 Then say, 'O Jehovah, you have said against this place that it will be destroyed and left without an inhabitant, man or beast, and that she will become desolate forever.' 63 And when you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates. 64 Then say, 'This is how Babylon will sink down and never rise again because of the calamity that I am bringing on her; and they will grow weary.'\"\nDown to this point are the words of Jeremiah.\nChapter 52\n1 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 2 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 3 It was because of Jehovah's anger that these things took place in Jerusalem and in Judah, until he cast them out of his sight. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 4 In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem. They camped against it and built a siege wall all around it. 5 And the city was under siege until the 11th year of King Zedekiah.\n6 In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land. 7 Finally the city wall was broken through, and all the soldiers fled from the city by night through the gate between the double wall near the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were surrounding the city; and they continued by the way of the Arabah. 8 But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho, and all his troops were scattered from his side. 9 Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. 10 And the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the princes of Judah there at Riblah. 11 Then the king of Babylon blinded Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with copper fetters, brought him to Babylon, and kept him imprisoned until the day of his death.\n12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that is, in the 19th year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard, who was an attendant of the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. 13 He burned down the house of Jehovah, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; he also burned down every large house. 14 And the walls surrounding Jerusalem were pulled down by the entire Chaldean army that was with the chief of the guard.\n15 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took into exile some of the lowly people and the rest of the people who were left in the city. He also took the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon as well as the rest of the master craftsmen. 16 But Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to serve as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers.\n17 And the Chaldeans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of Jehovah and the carriages and the copper Sea that were in the house of Jehovah, and they carried all the copper away to Babylon. 18 They also took the cans, the shovels, the extinguishers, the bowls, the cups, and all the copper utensils used in the temple service. 19 The chief of the guard took the basins, the fire holders, the bowls, the cans, the lampstands, the cups, and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver. 20 As for the two pillars, the Sea, the 12 copper bulls under the Sea, and the carriages that King Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing.\n21 As for the pillars, each pillar was 18 cubits high, a measuring cord of 12 cubits could encircle it; its thickness was four fingerbreadths, and it was hollow. 22 And the capital on it was of copper; and the height of the one capital was five cubits; and the network and pomegranates all around on the capital were all made of copper. The second pillar was just like it, also the pomegranates. 23 There were 96 pomegranates on the sides; in all, there were 100 pomegranates around the network.\n24 The chief of the guard also took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. 25 And he took from the city one court official who was the commissioner over the soldiers, seven close associates of the king who were found in the city, as well as the secretary of the chief of the army, the one mustering the people of the land, and 60 men of the common people of the land who were yet found in the city. 26 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 27 The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah went into exile from its land.\n28 These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews.\n29 In the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar, 832 people were taken from Jerusalem.\n30 In the 23rd year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took Jews into exile, 745 people.\nIn all, 4,600 people were taken into exile.\n31 Then in the 37th year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, in the 12th month, on the 25th day of the month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year he became king, released King Jehoiachin of Judah and brought him out of prison. 32 He spoke kindly with him and put his throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 33 So Jehoiachin took off his prison garments, and he regularly ate before him all the days of his life. 34 A regular allowance of food was given him from the king of Babylon, day after day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life. \n",

    "text": "Ezekiel\nChapter 1\n1 In the 30th year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiled people by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened and I began to see visions of God. 2 On the fifth day of the month-that is, in the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin- 3 the word of Jehovah came to Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest by the river Chebar in the land of the Chaldeans. There the hand of Jehovah came upon him.\n4 As I was looking, I saw a tempestuous wind coming from the north, and there was a huge cloud and flashing fire surrounded by a bright light, and from the midst of the fire was something that looked like electrum. 5 Within it were what looked like four living creatures, and the appearance of each one was like that of a human. 6 Each one had four faces and four wings. 7 Their feet were straight, and the soles of their feet were like those of a calf, and they were shining like the glow of burnished copper. 8 They had human hands under their wings on all four sides, and the four of them had faces and wings. 9 Their wings were touching one another. They would not turn when they went; they would each go straight forward.\n10 Their faces had this appearance: Each of the four had a man's face with a lion's face on the right, a bull's face on the left, and each of the four had an eagle's face. 11 That is how their faces were. Their wings were spread out above them. Each had two wings that were touching one another and two wings covering their bodies.\n12 They would each go straight forward, going wherever the spirit would incline them to go. They would not turn as they went. 13 And the living creatures had the appearance of burning coals of fire, and something that looked like torches of bright fire was moving back and forth between the living creatures, and lightning was flashing out from the fire. 14 And when the living creatures would go forth and return, their movement had the appearance of flashes of lightning.\n15 As I was watching the living creatures, I saw one wheel on the earth beside each of the living creatures with four faces. 16 The wheels and their structure appeared to glow like chrysolite, and the four of them looked alike. Their appearance and structure looked as though a wheel were within a wheel. 17 When they moved, they could go in any of the four directions without turning as they went. 18 Their rims were so high that they inspired awe, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. 19 Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels would move along with them, and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels would also be lifted up. 20 They would go where the spirit inclined them to go, wherever the spirit went. The wheels would be lifted up together with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures was also in the wheels. 21 When they moved, these would move; and when they stood still, these would stand still; and when they were lifted up from the earth, the wheels would be lifted up together with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures was also in the wheels.\n22 Over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an expanse that sparkled like awesome ice, stretched out above their heads. 23 Under the expanse their wings were straight, one to the other. Each one had two wings for covering one side of their bodies and two for covering the other side. 24 When I heard the sound of their wings, it was like a sound of rushing waters, like the sound of the Almighty. When they moved, it was like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they would let their wings down.\n25 There was a voice above the expanse over their heads. (When they stood still, they would let their wings down.) 26 Above the expanse that was over their heads was what looked like a sapphire stone, and it resembled a throne. Sitting on the throne up above was someone whose appearance resembled that of a human. 27 I saw something glowing like electrum that was like a fire radiating from what appeared to be his waist and upward; and from his waist down, I saw something that resembled fire. There was a brilliance all around him 28 like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. That was how the surrounding brilliant light appeared. It was like the appearance of the glory of Jehovah. When I saw it, I fell facedown and began to hear the voice of someone speaking.\nChapter 2\n1 He then said to me: \"Son of man, stand up on your feet that I may speak with you.\" 2 When he spoke to me, spirit came into me and made me stand up on my feet so that I could hear the One speaking to me.\n3 He went on to say to me: \"Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me. They and their forefathers have transgressed against me down to this very day. 4 I am sending you to sons who are defiant and hardhearted, and you must say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.' 5 As for them, whether they listen or refuse to listen-for they are a rebellious house-they will certainly know that a prophet was among them.\n6 \"But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and do not be afraid of their words, although you are surrounded by briars and thorns and are dwelling among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, and do not be terrified by their faces, for they are a rebellious house. 7 You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or not, for they are a rebellious people.\n8 \"But you, son of man, listen to what I am telling you. Do not become rebellious like this rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.\"\n9 When I looked, I saw a hand stretched out to me, and in it I saw a written scroll. 10 When he spread it out before me, it had writing on both front and back. Dirges and mourning and wailing were written on it.\nChapter 3\n1 Then he said to me: \"Son of man, eat what is before you. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.\"\n2 So I opened my mouth, and he made me eat this scroll. 3 He went on to say to me: \"Son of man, eat this scroll that I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.\" So I began to eat it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.\n4 He said to me: \"Son of man, go in among the house of Israel and speak my words to them. 5 For you are not being sent to a people who speak an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel. 6 You are not being sent to many peoples speaking an unintelligible language or an unknown tongue, whose words you cannot understand. If I would send you to them, they would listen to you. 7 But the house of Israel will refuse to listen to you, for they do not want to listen to me. All those of the house of Israel are hardheaded and hardhearted. 8 Look! I have made your face exactly as hard as their faces and your forehead exactly as hard as their foreheads. 9 I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or be terrified by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.\"\n10 He went on to say to me: \"Son of man, take to heart and listen to all my words that I speak to you. 11 Go in among the exiles of your people and speak to them. Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says,' whether they listen or refuse to listen.\"\n12 A spirit then carried me along and I heard behind me a great rumbling sound that said: \"May the glory of Jehovah be praised from his place.\" 13 There was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they were brushing against one another, and the sound of the wheels next to them, and the sound of a great rumbling. 14 And the spirit carried me along and took me, and I went in bitterness and in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah rested strongly on me. 15 So I went to the exiled people at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the river Chebar, and I stayed there where they were dwelling; and in a dazed condition, I stayed among them for seven days.\n16 At the end of seven days the word of Jehovah came to me:\n17 \"Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman to the house of Israel; and when you hear a word from my mouth, you must warn them from me. 18 When I say to someone wicked, 'You will surely die,' but you do not warn him, and you fail to speak in order to warn the wicked one to turn from his wicked course so that he may stay alive, he will die for his error because he is wicked, but I will ask his blood back from you. 19 But if you warn someone wicked and he does not turn back from his wickedness and from his wicked course, he will die for his error, but you will certainly save your own life. 20 But when someone righteous abandons his righteousness and does what is wrong, I will put a stumbling block before him and he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die for his sin and his righteous acts will not be remembered, but I will ask his blood back from you. 21 But if you have warned the righteous one not to sin, and he does not sin, he will surely keep alive because he was warned, and you will have saved your own life.\"\n22 The hand of Jehovah came upon me there, and he said to me: \"Get up, go to the valley plain, and I will speak with you there.\" 23 So I got up and went to the valley plain, and look! the glory of Jehovah was there, like the glory that I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell facedown. 24 Then spirit entered into me and made me stand up on my feet, and he spoke to me and said:\n\"Go, shut yourself inside your house. 25 As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and tie you with them so that you cannot go out among them. 26 And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will become mute, unable to reprove them, because they are a rebellious house. 27 But when I speak with you I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.' Let the one listening listen, and let the one refusing to listen refuse, because they are a rebellious house.\nChapter 4\n1 \"And you, son of man, take a brick and put it in front of you. Engrave on it a city-Jerusalem. 2 Lay siege to it, build a siege wall against it, raise up a siege rampart against it, set up camps against it, and surround it with battering rams. 3 Take an iron griddle and place it as an iron wall between you and the city. Then set your face against it, and it will be under siege; you are to besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.\n4 \"Then you should lie on your left side and lay the guilt of the house of Israel on yourself. You will carry their guilt for the number of days that you lie on your side. 5 And I will impose on you 390 days, corresponding to the years of their guilt, and you will carry the guilt of the house of Israel. 6 And you must complete them.\n\"Then for a second time you will lie down, on your right side, and you will carry the guilt of the house of Judah for 40 days. A day for a year, a day for a year, is what I have given you. 7 And you will turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and you must prophesy against it.\n8 \"Look! I will tie you with ropes so that you cannot turn from your one side to your other side until you have completed the days of your siege.\n9 \"And you should take wheat, barley, broad beans, lentils, millet, and spelt and put them in one container and make them into bread for yourself. For the number of the days that you are lying on your side, 390 days, you will eat it. 10 You will weigh out and eat 20 shekels of food per day. You will eat it at set times.\n11 \"And you will drink water by measure, a sixth of a hin. You will drink it at set times.\n12 \"You will eat it as you would a round barley loaf; you will bake it before their eyes, using dried human excrement as fuel.\" 13 Jehovah went on to say: \"This is how the Israelites will eat their bread-unclean-among the nations where I will disperse them.\"\n14 I then said: \"Not that, Sovereign Lord Jehovah! From my youth until now, I have not been defiled by eating meat from an animal found dead or a torn animal, and no unclean meat has entered my mouth.\"\n15 So he said to me: \"All right, I will allow you to use cattle manure instead of human excrement, and you will bake your bread over it.\" 16 He then said to me: \"Son of man, here I am cutting off the food supply in Jerusalem, and with great anxiety they will eat their bread ration by weight, and in horror they will drink their water ration by measure. 17 This will happen so that lacking bread and water, they may look in shock at one another and waste away because of their error.\nChapter 5\n1 \"As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword for yourself to use as a barber's razor. Shave your head and your beard, and then take scales to weigh and divide the hair into portions. 2 You will burn a third of it in the fire inside the city when the days of the siege are completed. Then you will take another third and strike it with the sword all around the city, and the last third you will scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword to chase after them.\n3 \"You must also take a few strands of them and wrap them up in the folds of your garment. 4 And take some more of them and throw them into the fire and incinerate them. From this a fire will spread to all the house of Israel.\n5 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, with lands all around her. 6 But she has rebelled against my judicial decisions and my statutes, acting more wickedly than the nations and the lands all around her. For they have rejected my judicial decisions, and they did not walk in my statutes.'\n7 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Because you were more troublesome than the nations all around you and you did not walk in my statutes or carry out my judicial decisions but, instead, you followed the judicial decisions of the nations all around you, 8 this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"Here I am against you, O city, and I myself will execute judgment in your midst before the eyes of the nations. 9 I will do in you what I have never done before, and the likes of which I will not do again, because of all your detestable practices.\n10 \"'\"So fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers, and I will execute judgment among you and scatter all the rest of you in every direction.\"'\n11 \"'Therefore as surely as I am alive,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'because it was my sanctuary that you defiled with all your disgusting idols and with all your detestable practices, I will also reject you; my eye will not feel sorry, and I will show no compassion. 12 A third of you will die by the pestilence or perish in your midst by famine. Another third will fall all around you by the sword. And I will scatter the last third in every direction, and I will draw a sword to chase after them. 13 Then my anger will come to an end, and my wrath against them will subside, and I will be satisfied. And they will have to know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my insistence on exclusive devotion, when I have finished unleashing my wrath against them.\n14 \"'I will make you a devastated place and an object of reproach among the surrounding nations and in the eyes of everyone passing by. 15 You will become an object of reproach and scorn, a warning example and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute judgment on you in anger and in wrath and with furious punishments. I, Jehovah, have spoken.\n16 \"'I will send against them the deadly arrows of famine to destroy them. The arrows that I send will bring you to ruin. I will make the famine worse for you by cutting off your food supply. 17 I will send against you famine and vicious wild beasts, and they will bereave you of children. Pestilence and bloodshed will overwhelm you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.'\"\nChapter 6\n1 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"Son of man, turn your face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. 3 You must say, 'O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the mountains, to the hills, to the streams, and to the valleys: \"Look! I will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places. 4 Your altars will be demolished, your incense stands will be broken, and I will throw your slain ones down before your disgusting idols. 5 I will throw the carcasses of the people of Israel before their disgusting idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars. 6 In all the places where you dwell, the cities will be devastated and the high places will be demolished and will lie devastated. Your altars will be demolished and shattered, your disgusting idols will perish, your incense stands will be cut down, and your works will be wiped out. 7 And those slain will fall in your midst, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.\n8 \"'\"But I will leave a remnant, for some of you will escape the sword among the nations when you are scattered throughout the lands. 9 And those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive. They will realize that I was brokenhearted over their unfaithful heart that turned away from me and at their eyes that are lusting after their disgusting idols. They will be ashamed of and loathe all the evil and detestable things they have done. 10 They will have to know that I am Jehovah and that my threats to bring this calamity on them were not empty.\"'\n11 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Clap your hands and stamp your foot and bemoan all the evil and detestable things done by the house of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. 12 The one far away will die by pestilence, the one nearby will fall by the sword, and whoever escapes these and is left remaining will die by famine; and I will fully unleash my wrath against them. 13 And you will have to know that I am Jehovah, when their slain lie among their disgusting idols, all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every luxuriant tree, and under the branches of big trees where they have made fragrant offerings to appease all their disgusting idols. 14 I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land desolate, and all their dwelling places will become more desolate than the wilderness near Diblah. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.'\"\nChapter 7\n1 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"As for you, son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the land of Israel: 'An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. 3 The end is now upon you, and I will unleash my anger against you, and I will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds. 4 My eye will not feel sorry for you; nor will I feel compassion, for I will bring upon you the results of your own ways, and you will suffer the consequences of your detestable deeds. And you will have to know that I am Jehovah.'\n5 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Look! A calamity, a unique calamity, is coming. 6 An end is coming; the end will come; it will rouse itself against you. Look! It is coming. 7 Your turn has come, you who inhabit the land. The time is coming, the day is near. There is confusion and not joyful shouting on the mountains.\n8 \"'Very soon I will pour out my rage on you, and I will fully unleash my anger against you, and I will judge you according to your ways and call you to account for all your detestable deeds. 9 My eye will not feel sorry; nor will I feel compassion. I will bring on you the results of your ways, and you will suffer the consequences of your own detestable deeds. And you will have to know that I, Jehovah, am striking you.\n10 \"'Look, the day! Look, it is coming! Your turn has come; the rod has blossomed and presumptuousness has sprouted. 11 Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness. Neither they nor their wealth nor their crowds nor their prominence will survive. 12 The time will come, the day will arrive. Let the buyer not rejoice, and let the seller not mourn, for there is wrath against their whole crowd. 13 For the seller will not return to what was sold, even if his life is spared, for the vision is against the entire multitude. No one will return, and because of his error, no one will preserve his life.\n14 \"'They have blown the trumpet, and everyone is ready, but no one is going to the battle, because my wrath is against the whole multitude. 15 The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine are inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword, and famine and pestilence will consume those in the city. 16 Their survivors who manage to escape will go to the mountains, and like the doves of the valleys, each one will moan over his error. 17 All their hands will hang limp, and all their knees will drip with water. 18 They have put on sackcloth, and shuddering has seized them. Everyone will be put to shame, and every head will be bald.\n19 \"'They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will become abhorrent to them. Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of Jehovah's fury. They will not be satisfied, nor will they fill their stomachs, for it has become a stumbling block causing their error. 20 They took pride in the beauty of their ornaments, and they made with them their detestable images, their disgusting idols. That is why I will make it an abhorrent thing to them. 21 I will give it into the hand of the foreigners for plunder and to the wicked ones of the earth for spoil, and they will profane it.\n22 \"'I will turn my face away from them, and they will profane my concealed place, and robbers will enter it and profane it.\n23 \"'Make the chain, for the land is full of bloodstained judgment and the city is full of violence. 24 I will bring in the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses, and I will put an end to the pride of the strong ones, and their sanctuaries will be profaned. 25 When their anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none. 26 There will come disaster upon disaster, and one report after another, and people will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will perish from a priest and advice from the elders. 27 The king will go into mourning, and the chieftain will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble in terror. I will treat them according to their ways, and I will judge them as they have judged. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.'\"\nChapter 8\n1 And in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah took hold of me there. 2 As I watched, I saw a form similar to the appearance of fire; there was fire below what appeared to be his waist, and from his waist upward his appearance was bright, like the glow of electrum. 3 Then he stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by a tuft of hair of my head, and a spirit carried me between the earth and the heavens and brought me to Jerusalem by means of the visions from God, to the entrance of the inner gate that faces north, where the idolatrous symbol of jealousy that incites jealousy stood. 4 And look! the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the appearance that I had seen in the valley plain.\n5 He then said to me: \"Son of man, please raise your eyes toward the north.\" So I raised my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the gate of the altar, was this symbol of jealousy in the entryway. 6 And he said to me: \"Son of man, do you see what terrible, detestable things the house of Israel is doing here, things that make me go far away from my sanctuary? But you will see detestable things that are even more terrible.\"\n7 Then he brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and when I looked, I saw a hole in the wall. 8 He said to me: \"Son of man, please bore through the wall.\" So I bored through the wall, and I saw an entryway. 9 He said to me: \"Go in and see the evil, detestable things that they are doing here.\" 10 So I went in and looked, and I saw all sorts of images of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the disgusting idols of the house of Israel; they were carved on the wall all around. 11 And 70 of the elders of the house of Israel were standing before them, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each one had his censer in his hand, and the perfumed cloud of incense was ascending. 12 He said to me: \"Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms where his idols are displayed? For they are saying, 'Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.'\"\n13 And he went on to say to me: \"You will see detestable things that are even more terrible that they are doing.\" 14 So he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of Jehovah, and there I saw women sitting and weeping over the god Tammuz.\n15 And he further said to me: \"Do you see this, O son of man? You will see detestable things that are even more terrible than these.\" 16 So he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah. There at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men with their backs to the temple of Jehovah and their faces to the east; they were bowing down to the sun in the east.\n17 He said to me: \"Son of man, do you see this? Is it a trivial thing for the house of Judah to do these detestable things, to fill the land with violence and keep offending me? Here they are thrusting out the branch to my nose. 18 So I will act in rage. My eye will not feel sorry; nor will I feel compassion. Even though they cry out loudly in my ears, I will not hear them.\"\nChapter 9\n1 He then called out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: \"Summon those who will bring punishment on the city, each one with his weapon for destruction in his hand!\"\n2 I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate that faces north, each with his weapon for smashing in his hand; and there was one man among them clothed in linen, with a secretary's inkhorn at his waist, and they came in and stood beside the copper altar.\n3 Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen, at whose waist was the secretary's inkhorn. 4 Jehovah said to him: \"Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city.\"\n5 And to the others he said in my hearing: \"Go through the city after him and strike. Do not let your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion. 6 Old man, young man, virgin, little child, and women you should kill off completely. But do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark. You should start from my sanctuary.\" So they started with the elders who were in front of the house. 7 Then he said to them: \"Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain. Go!\" So they went out and struck down people in the city.\n8 While they were striking them down, I alone was left, and I fell facedown and cried out: \"Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of Israel while you pour out your rage on Jerusalem?\"\n9 So he said to me: \"The error of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great. The land is filled with bloodshed, and the city is full of corruption. For they say, 'Jehovah has left the land, and Jehovah is not seeing.' 10 But as for me, my eye will not feel sorry; nor will I show compassion. The consequences of their way I will bring down on their own head.\"\n11 Then I saw the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his waist bringing back word, saying: \"I have done just as you have commanded me.\"\nChapter 10\n1 As I was watching, I saw above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubs something like a sapphire stone appearing above them, and its appearance resembled a throne. 2 Then he said to the man clothed in linen: \"Enter between the wheelwork, under the cherubs, and fill both your hands with burning coals from between the cherubs and toss them over the city.\" So he entered as I watched.\n3 The cherubs were standing to the right of the house when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard. 4 And the glory of Jehovah rose up from the cherubs to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and the house gradually became filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah. 5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubs could be heard in the outer courtyard, like the sound of God Almighty when he speaks.\n6 Then he commanded the man clothed in linen: \"Take fire from between the wheelwork, from between the cherubs,\" and he entered and stood beside the wheel. 7 Then one of the cherubs stretched his hand out toward the fire that was between the cherubs. He took some and put it into both hands of the one clothed in linen, who now took it and went out. 8 The cherubs had what looked like the form of human hands under their wings.\n9 As I was watching, I saw four wheels beside the cherubs, one wheel beside each cherub, and the wheels appeared to glow like chrysolite stone. 10 As for their appearance, the four of them were alike, looking as though a wheel were within a wheel. 11 When they moved, they could go in any of the four directions without turning, because they would go to the place where the head would face without turning. 12 Their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, the wheels of all four of them, were full of eyes all around. 13 As regards the wheels, I heard a voice that called to them, \"Wheelwork!\"\n14 Each one had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle.\n15 And the cherubs would rise-they were the same living creatures that I had seen at the river Chebar- 16 and when the cherubs moved, the wheels would move alongside them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels would not turn or move from their side. 17 When these stood still, they would stand still; and when these rose, they would rise with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures was in them.\n18 Then the glory of Jehovah departed from over the threshold of the doorway of the house and stood still over the cherubs. 19 The cherubs now lifted up their wings and rose from the earth as I watched. The wheels were also alongside them when they departed. They stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.\n20 These were the living creatures that I had seen under the God of Israel at the river Chebar, so I came to know that they were cherubs. 21 All four had four faces, four wings, and what appeared to be human hands under their wings. 22 And the appearances of their faces were like the faces I had seen by the river Chebar. They would each go straight forward.\nChapter 11\n1 And a spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, the gate that faces east. There at the entrance of the gate I saw 25 men, and among them were Jaazaniah the son of Azzur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 2 Then He said to me: \"Son of man, these are the men who are scheming evil and giving wicked advice in this city. 3 They are saying, 'Is it not the time for building houses? The city is the cooking pot, and we are the flesh.'\n4 \"So prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man.\"\n5 Then the spirit of Jehovah came upon me, and he said to me: \"Say, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"What you have said is correct, O house of Israel, and I know what you are thinking. 6 You have caused many to die in this city, and you have filled her streets with the dead.\"'\" 7 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'The dead bodies that you have strewn about the city are the flesh, and the city is the cooking pot. But you yourselves will be taken out of it.'\"\n8 \"'A sword you have feared, and a sword I will bring against you,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 9 'I will bring you out of her and give you into the hand of foreigners and execute judgment on you. 10 You will fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. 11 The city will not be a cooking pot for you, and you will not be the flesh within it; I will judge you at the border of Israel, 12 and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. For you did not walk in my regulations and carry out my judgments, but you have acted in harmony with the judgments of the nations around you.'\"\n13 As soon as I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died, and I fell facedown and cried with a loud voice: \"Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to exterminate the remaining ones of Israel?\"\n14 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 15 \"Son of man, your brothers, those of your brothers with the right of repurchase, along with the entire house of Israel, have been told by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 'Keep far away from Jehovah. The land is ours; it has been given to us as a possession.' 16 Therefore say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"Although I have removed them far away among the nations and I have scattered them among the lands, for a little while I will become a sanctuary for them in the lands to which they have gone.\"'\n17 \"Therefore say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"I will also collect you from the peoples and gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 18 And they will return there and remove from it all its disgusting things and detestable practices. 19 And I will give them a unified heart, and I will put a new spirit in them; and I will remove the heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh, 20 in order that they may walk in my statutes and observe my judgments and obey them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.\"'\n21 \"'\"But as for those whose hearts are set to continue in their disgusting things and their detestable practices, I will bring the consequences of their way upon their head,\" declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.'\"\n22 The cherubs now lifted up their wings, and the wheels were close to them, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 23 Then the glory of Jehovah ascended from the city and stopped over the mountain to the east of the city. 24 A spirit then lifted me up-through a vision by the spirit of God-and brought me to the exiled people in Chaldea. Then the vision that I had seen left me. 25 And I began to tell the exiled people all the things that Jehovah had shown me.\nChapter 12\n1 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"Son of man, you are living in a rebellious house. They have eyes to see, but they do not see, and ears to hear, but they do not hear, for they are a rebellious house. 3 As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself luggage for going into exile. Then, during the day while they are watching, you must go into exile. Go into exile from your home to another place while they are watching. Perhaps they will take notice, even though they are a rebellious house. 4 Bring out your luggage packed for going into exile during the day while they are watching, and then in the evening while they are watching, you should leave like someone being taken into exile.\n5 \"While they are watching, bore a hole in the wall, and carry your belongings out through it. 6 While they are watching, put your belongings on your shoulder and carry them out in the darkness. Cover your face so that you cannot see the ground, for I am making you a sign to the house of Israel.\"\n7 I did just as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my luggage as luggage for going into exile, and in the evening I bored a hole through the wall by hand. And when it was dark, I took out my belongings, carrying them on my shoulder right before their eyes.\n8 In the morning the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 9 \"Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, ask you, 'What are you doing?' 10 Tell them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"This pronouncement concerns the chieftain in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel within the city.\"'\n11 \"Say, 'I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, that is what will be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity. 12 The chieftain who is among them will carry his belongings on his shoulder and leave in the darkness. He will bore a hole in the wall and carry his belongings out through it. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the ground.' 13 I will cast my net over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net. Then I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it; and there he will die. 14 And all those around him, his helpers and his troops, I will scatter in every direction; and I will draw out a sword to chase after them. 15 And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I disperse them among the nations and I scatter them among the lands. 16 But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, so that they may tell about all their detestable practices among the nations where they will go; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.\"\n17 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 18 \"Son of man, you should eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with agitation and anxiety. 19 Say to the people of the land, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: \"They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, for their land will become completely desolate because of the violence of all those dwelling in it. 20 The inhabited cities will be devastated, and the land will become a wasteland; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.\"'\"\n21 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 22 \"Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in Israel that says, 'The days go by, and every vision comes to nothing'? 23 Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"I will cause this saying to cease, and they will no more use it as a proverb in Israel.\"' But tell them, 'The days are near, and every vision will take place.' 24 For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. 25 '\"For I, Jehovah, will speak. Whatever word I speak will be done without any more delay. In your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and carry it out,\" declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.'\"\n26 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 27 \"Son of man, this is what the people of Israel are saying, 'The vision that he sees is for a long time from now, and he is prophesying about the distant future.' 28 Therefore say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"'None of my words will be delayed; whatever I say will be done,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"'\"\nChapter 13\n1 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, and say to those who fabricate their own prophecies, 'Hear the word of Jehovah. 3 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"Woe to the stupid prophets, who follow their own spirit, when they have seen nothing! 4 O Israel, your prophets have become like foxes among the ruins. 5 You will not go to the broken places in the stone walls to rebuild them for the house of Israel, so that Israel may keep standing in the battle in the day of Jehovah.\" 6 \"They have seen false visions and foretold a lie, those who are saying, 'The word of Jehovah is,' when Jehovah himself has not sent them, and they have waited for their word to come true. 7 Is it not a false vision that you have seen and a lie that you have foretold when you say, 'The word of Jehovah is,' when I have not said anything?\"'\n8 \"'Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"'Because you have spoken what is false and your visions are a lie, I am against you,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\" 9 My hand is against the prophets whose visions are false and who foretell a lie. They will not be among the people with whom I confide; nor will they be written in the registry of the house of Israel; nor will they return to the land of Israel; and you will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 10 All of this is because they have led my people astray by saying, \"There is peace!\" when there is no peace. When a flimsy partition wall is built, they are plastering it with whitewash.'\n11 \"Tell those plastering with whitewash that it will fall. A torrential downpour will come, hailstones will fall, and powerful windstorms will break it down. 12 And when the wall falls you will be asked, 'Where is your coating of plaster?'\n13 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'I will cause powerful windstorms to burst forth in my wrath, and a torrential downpour in my anger, and hailstones in destructive fury. 14 I will tear down the wall that you plastered with whitewash and bring it down to the earth, and its foundation will be exposed.

Yes, I said to you lying there in your blood: 'Keep living!' 7 I made you a very great multitude, like plants sprouting in the field, and you grew up and developed and wore the finest ornaments. Your breasts became firm, and your hair grew; but you were still naked and exposed.\"'\n8 \"'When I was passing by and saw you, I noticed that you were old enough for expressions of love.

Fine flour, honey, and oil were what you ate, and you grew to be extremely beautiful, and you became fit to be a queen.'\"\n14 \"'Your fame began to spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect because my own splendor I placed upon you,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\n15 \"'But you began to trust in your beauty, and you became a prostitute because of your fame.

That is exactly what happened,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\n20 \"'You took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne to me, and you sacrificed these to idols to be devoured-have your acts of prostitution not gone far enough? 21 You slaughtered my sons, and you offered them as sacrifices by making them pass through the fire. 22 While engaging in all your detestable practices and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and exposed, kicking about in your own blood. 23 After all your evil, woe, woe to you,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 24 'You built yourself a mound and made a high place for yourself in every public square. 25 You built your high places at the most prominent place of every street, and you turned your beauty into something detestable by offering yourself to everyone passing by, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution. 26 You prostituted yourself to the sons of Egypt, your lustful neighbors, and you offended me with your countless acts of prostitution. 27 Now I will bring my hand against you and diminish your food allowance and give you over to the will of the women who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were appalled because of your obscene conduct.\n28 \"'Because you could not be satisfied, you then prostituted yourself to the sons of Assyria, but after prostituting yourself to them, you still did not find satisfaction. 29 So you increased your prostitution toward the land of traders and toward the Chaldeans, but even then you did not find satisfaction. 30 How sick your heart was,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'when you did all these things, behaving like a brazen prostitute! 31 But when you built your mound at the most prominent place of every street and made your high place in every public square, you were not like a prostitute, because you refused any payment. 32 You are an adulterous wife who takes strangers instead of her own husband! 33 People give all prostitutes a gift, but you are the one who has given gifts to all those lusting after you, and you bribe them to come to you from all around to commit prostitution. 34 You are the opposite of other women who engage in prostitution. No one commits prostitution your way! You pay others, and they do not pay you. Your way is the opposite.'\n35 \"Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of Jehovah. 36 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Because your lust has been poured out and your nakedness has been exposed during your prostitution with your lovers and all your detestable, disgusting idols to which you even sacrificed the blood of your sons, 37 therefore I am collecting together all the lovers you have given pleasure to, all those you loved together with all those you hated.

Everyone who uses proverbs will apply this proverb to you: \"Like mother, like daughter!\" 45 You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children.

This was the error of Sodom your sister: She and her daughters were proud and had an abundance of food and carefree tranquility; yet they did not support the afflicted and the poor. 50 They remained haughty and carried on detestable practices in my sight, so I found it necessary to remove them.\n51 \"'Nor did Samaria commit even half as many sins as you did.

On account of your sin of acting more detestably than they have, they are more righteous than you.

He planted it like a willow by abundant waters. 6 So it sprouted and became a low, sprawling vine with its foliage facing inward and its roots growing under it.

Should I at the same time respond to your inquiry, O house of Israel?\"'\n\"'As surely as I am alive,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'I will not respond to your inquiry. 32 And what you have in mind when you say, \"Let us become like the nations, like the families of the other lands, who worship wood and stone,\" it will never happen.'\"\n33 \"'As surely as I am alive,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'I will rule as king over you with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with an outpouring of rage. 34 I will bring you out from the peoples and collect you together out of the lands where you have been scattered with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with an outpouring of rage. 35 I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and enter into judgment with you there face-to-face.\n36 \"'Just as I entered into judgment with your forefathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 37 'I will make you pass under the shepherd's staff and bring you under obligation to the covenant. 38 But I will remove from you the rebels and those transgressing against me. For I will bring them out of the land of their foreign residence, but they will not enter the land of Israel; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.'\n39 \"As for you, O house of Israel, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Each of you go and serve his disgusting idols.

Both of them will originate from the same land, and a signpost should be set up where the road branches off to the two cities. 20 You should mark out one way for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and the other way against fortified Jerusalem in Judah. 21 For the king of Babylon stops to use divination at the fork in the road, where the two roads branch off. He shakes the arrows. He consults his idols; he examines the liver. 22 The divination in his right hand is pointed toward Jerusalem, to set up battering rams, to give the word for slaughter, to sound the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to throw up a siege rampart, to build a siege wall. 23 But it will seem like false divination in the eyes of those who had sworn oaths to them. But he remembers their guilt and will capture them.\n24 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'You have caused your own guilt to be remembered by exposing your transgressions and causing your sins to be seen in all your actions. Now that you have been remembered, you will be taken by force.'\n25 \"But your day has come, O fatally wounded, wicked chieftain of Israel, the time of your final punishment. 26 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Remove the turban, and take off the crown. This will not remain the same. Raise up the low one, and bring low the high one. 27 A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it. And it will not belong to anyone until the one who has the legal right comes, and I will give it to him.'\n28 \"And you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says about the Ammonites and about their insults.'

I will judge you in the place that you were created, in the land of your origin. 31 I will pour out my indignation on you. I will blow upon you with the fire of my fury, and I will hand you over to brutal men, the craftsmen of destruction. 32 You will become fuel for the fire; your own blood will be shed in the land, and you will be remembered no more, for I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.'\"\nChapter 22\n1 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"As for you, son of man, are you prepared to pronounce judgment on the bloodguilty city and to make known to her all her detestable things? 3 You are to say, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"O city that sheds blood within herself, whose time is coming, who makes disgusting idols to defile herself, 4 your bloodshed has made you guilty, and your disgusting idols have made you unclean.

You lend on interest or for a profit, and you extort money from your neighbors. Yes, you have entirely forgotten me,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\n13 \"'Look! I clap my hands in disgust at the dishonest gain you have made and over the acts of bloodshed in your midst. 14 Will your courage endure and your hands remain strong in the days when I take action against you?

All of them are copper and tin and iron and lead in a furnace. They have become the dross of silver.\n19 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Because all of you have become like worthless dross, I am collecting you together inside Jerusalem. 20 Just as silver and copper and iron and lead and tin are collected inside a furnace in order to blow fire upon them and melt them, so I will collect you together in my anger and in my rage, and I will blow upon you and make you melt. 21 I will bring you together and blow upon you with the fire of my fury, and you will be melted inside of her. 22 Just as silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her; and you will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have poured out my rage on you.'\"\n23 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 24 \"Son of man, say to her, 'You are a land that will not be cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation. 25 Her prophets have conspired within her, like a roaring lion tearing prey. They are devouring people. They are seizing treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within her. 26 Her priests have violated my law, and they keep profaning my holy places. They make no distinction between what is holy and what is common, and they fail to make known what is unclean and what is clean, and they refuse to observe my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. 27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing prey; they shed blood and kill people to make dishonest gain. 28 But her prophets have plastered over their deeds with whitewash. They see false visions and give lying divination, and they say: \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says,\" when Jehovah himself has not spoken. 29 The people of the land have defrauded and committed robbery, they have mistreated the needy and the poor, and they have defrauded the foreign resident and denied him justice.'\n30 \"'I was looking for a man from among them who would repair the stone wall or stand before me in the breach in behalf of the land, so that it would not be destroyed, but I found no one. 31 So I will pour out my indignation on them and exterminate them with the fire of my fury. I will bring the consequences of their way on their own head,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\nChapter 23\n1 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"Son of man, there were two women who were the daughters of the same mother. 3 They became prostitutes in Egypt; from their youth they engaged in prostitution. Their breasts were squeezed there, and their virgin bosoms were fondled. 4 Their names were Oholah, the older one, and her sister Oholibah. They became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.\n5 \"Oholah began to prostitute herself while she belonged to me. She lusted after her passionate lovers, her neighbors the Assyrians. 6 They were governors clothed in blue and deputy rulers-all desirable young men mounted on their horses. 7 She continued to prostitute herself with all the choicest sons of Assyria, and she defiled herself with the disgusting idols of those she lusted after. 8 She did not abandon the prostitution she practiced in Egypt, for in her youth they had lain down with her, and they fondled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. 9 So I gave her into the hand of her passionate lovers, the sons of Assyria, after whom she had lusted. 10 They exposed her nakedness and seized her sons and daughters, and they killed her with a sword. She became notorious among women, and they executed judgment against her.\n11 \"When her sister Oholibah saw it, her lust became even more depraved, and her prostitution was worse than that of her sister. 12 She lusted after her neighbors the sons of Assyria, the governors and deputy rulers who were clothed in splendor and mounted on horses-all desirable young men. 13 When she defiled herself, I saw that both of them had followed the same course. 14 But she kept adding to her acts of prostitution. She saw men carved on the wall, images of Chaldeans carved in vermilion, 15 wearing belts around their waist, with flowing turbans on their heads, having the appearance of warriors, all of them depicting Babylonians, born in the land of the Chaldeans. 16 She began to lust after them as soon as she saw them, and she sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 17 So the sons of Babylon kept coming to her bed of lovemaking, and they defiled her with their lust. After she was defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.\n18 \"When she went on brazenly engaging in prostitution and exposing her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister in disgust. 19 And she kept increasing her acts of prostitution, calling to mind the days of her youth when she prostituted herself in the land of Egypt. 20 She lusted after them like the concubines of men whose male members are like those of a donkey and whose genitals are like those of a horse. 21 You yearned for the obscene conduct of your youth in Egypt when they fondled your bosom, the breasts of your youth.\n22 \"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Here I am stirring up your lovers whom you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every direction, 23 the sons of Babylon and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, along with all the sons of Assyria. All of them are desirable young men, governors and deputy rulers, warriors and handpicked, all mounted on horses. 24 They will attack you with rumbling war chariots and wheels and with a great assembly of troops, with large shield and buckler and helmet. They will take up positions all around you, and I will authorize them to pass judgment, and they will judge you as they see fit. 25 I will express my indignation against you, and they will deal with you in their rage. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and those of you who remain will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and your daughters, and those of you who remain will be consumed by fire. 26 They will strip off your garments and seize your beautiful jewelry. 27 I will put an end to your obscene conduct and your prostitution, which started in the land of Egypt. You will stop looking at them, and you will remember Egypt no more.'\n28 \"For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Here I am about to hand you over to those you hate, those you turned away from in disgust. 29 They will deal with you in hatred and take away all you have toiled for and leave you naked and exposed. The shameful nakedness of your immorality and your obscene conduct and your prostitution will be exposed. 30 These things will be done to you because you chased after the nations like a prostitute, because you defiled yourself with their disgusting idols. 31 You have followed the same course as your sister, and I will put her cup into your hand.'\n32 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n'You will drink the deep and wide cup of your sister,\nAnd you will become an object of laughter and ridicule, of which the cup contains much.\n33 You will be overcome by drunkenness and grief,\nA cup of horror and desolation,\nThe cup of your sister, Samaria.\n34 You will have to drink it and drain it dry and gnaw on its earthenware fragments\nAnd then tear out your breasts.\n\"For I myself have spoken,\" declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.'\n35 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'Because you have forgotten me and have completely disregarded me, you will bear the consequences of your obscene conduct and your acts of prostitution.'\"\n36 Jehovah then said to me: \"Son of man, will you pronounce judgment on Oholah and Oholibah and confront them with their disgusting practices? 37 They have committed adultery, and there is blood on their hands. Not only have they committed adultery with their disgusting idols, but they have also made their sons whom they bore to me pass through the fire as food for their idols. 38 Moreover, this is what they have done to me: They defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my sabbaths. 39 After they slaughtered their sons as sacrifices to their disgusting idols, they came into my sanctuary to profane it on that very day. That is what they did inside my own house. 40 They even sent a messenger for men to come from far away. When they were coming, you washed yourself and painted your eyes and adorned yourself with ornaments. 41 And you sat down on a magnificent couch with a table set in front of it, on which you put my incense and my oil. 42 The sound of a carefree crowd of men was heard there, among whom were drunkards brought in from the wilderness. They put bracelets on the hands of the women and beautiful crowns on their heads.\n43 \"Then I said regarding her who was worn out with adultery: 'Now she will keep committing her prostitution.' 44 So they kept going in to her, just as one goes to a prostitute. That is how they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the women of obscene conduct. 45 But righteous men will render to her the appropriate judgment for adultery and bloodshed; for adulteresses is what they are, and they have blood on their hands.\n46 \"For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'An army will be brought against them to make them an object of horror and something to plunder. 47 The army will hurl stones at them and cut them down with their swords. They will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire. 48 I will put an end to the obscene conduct in the land, and all the women will learn a lesson and not copy your obscene conduct. 49 They will bring on you the consequences of your obscene conduct and of your sins with your disgusting idols; and you will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.'\"\nChapter 24\n1 The word of Jehovah again came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying: 2 \"Son of man, record this date, this very day. The king of Babylon has begun his attack against Jerusalem on this very day. 3 And relate a proverb concerning the rebellious house, and say concerning them:\n\"'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n\"Put the cooking pot on; put it on the fire and pour water into it.\n4 Put pieces of meat into it, every good piece,\nThe thigh and the shoulder; fill it with the choicest bones.\n5 Take the choicest sheep of the flock, and stack the logs all around under the pot.\nBoil the pieces, and cook the bones inside it.\"'\n6 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n'Woe to the city of bloodshed, the rusty cooking pot, whose rust has not been removed!\nEmpty it piece by piece; do not cast lots for them.\n7 For its blood is within it; she poured it out on the bare rock.\nShe did not pour it out on the earth, to cover it over with dust.\n8 To stir up rage for executing vengeance,\nI have put her blood on the shining, bare rock\nSo that it may not be covered over.'\n9 \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n'Woe to the city of bloodshed!\nI will pile the wood high.\n10 Heap on the logs and kindle the fire,\nBoil the flesh thoroughly, pour out the broth, and let the bones be charred.\n11 Set the empty pot on the coals to make it hot\nSo that its copper will become red hot.\nIts uncleanness will melt away within it, and its rust will be consumed.\n12 It is frustrating and exhausting,\nFor the heavy rust will not come off.\nThrow it into the fire with its rust!'\n13 \"'Your uncleanness was due to your obscene conduct. I tried to cleanse you, but you would not become clean from your uncleanness. You will not become clean until my rage against you subsides. 14 I myself, Jehovah, have spoken. It will come to pass.

They will judge you according to your ways and your dealings,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\n15 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 16 \"Son of man, in a single blow I am about to take away your dear one from you. You should not mourn; nor should you weep or shed tears. 17 Groan in silence, and do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put on your sandals. You should not cover over the mustache, and do not eat the bread brought to you by others.\"\n18 And I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. So I did in the morning just as I had been commanded. 19 The people were saying to me: \"Will you not tell us what these things you are doing have to do with us?\" 20 I replied to them: \"The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying, 21 'Tell the house of Israel: \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says, 'I am about to profane my sanctuary, the source of your great pride, the thing dear to you and the desire of your heart.

I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered in the day of clouds and thick gloom. 13 I will bring them out from the peoples and collect them together from the lands and bring them into their land and feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams and by all the dwelling places of the land. 14 In a good pasture I will feed them, and the land where they graze will be on Israel's high mountains. They will lie down there in a good grazing land, and they will feed on choice pastures on the mountains of Israel.\"\n15 \"'\"I myself will feed my sheep, and I myself will make them lie down,\" declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 16 \"The lost one I will search for, the stray I will bring back, the injured I will bandage, and the weak I will strengthen; but the fat one and the strong one I will annihilate. I will feed that one with judgment.\"\n17 \"'As for you, my sheep, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"I am about to judge between one sheep and another sheep, between the rams and the male goats. 18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the very best pastures? Must you also trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? And after drinking the clearest water, must you foul the water by stamping with your feet? 19 Should my sheep now feed on the pasture trampled by your feet and drink the water befouled by the stamping of your feet?\"\n20 \"'Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to them: \"Here I am, and I myself will judge between a fat sheep and a lean sheep, 21 for with your flank and shoulder you kept pushing, and with your horns you kept shoving all the sick ones until you had scattered them abroad. 22 And I will save my sheep, and they will no longer become something to prey upon; and I will judge between a sheep and a sheep. 23 I will raise up one shepherd over them, my servant David, and he will feed them. He himself will feed them and become their shepherd. 24 And I, Jehovah, will become their God, and my servant David a chieftain among them. I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.\n25 \"'\"And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and I will rid the land of vicious wild beasts, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests. 26 I will make them and the area around my hill a blessing, and I will cause the rain to fall at the proper time. Blessings will pour down like the rains. 27 The trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the soil will give its produce, and they will dwell securely on the land. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I break their yoke bars and rescue them from those who enslaved them. 28 They will no longer become something for the nations to prey upon, and the wild beasts of the earth will not devour them, and they will dwell in security, with no one to make them afraid.\n29 \"'\"I will establish for them a plantation of fame, and they will no longer die from famine in the land, and they will no longer be humiliated by the nations. 30 'Then they will have to know that I, Jehovah their God, am with them and that they, the house of Israel, are my people,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"'\n31 \"'As for you, my sheep, the sheep that I care for, you are but men, and I am your God,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\nChapter 35\n1 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 \"Son of man, turn your face toward the mountainous region of Seir, and prophesy against it. 3 Say to it, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"Here I am against you, O mountainous region of Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate wasteland. 4 I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolate wasteland; and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. 5 For you showed unrelenting hostility, and you gave the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of their final punishment.\"'\n6 \"'Therefore as surely as I am alive,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you.

I heard it all.'\n14 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'The whole earth will rejoice when I will make you a desolate wasteland. 15 Just as you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel was laid desolate, that is how I will deal with you. You will become a desolate ruin, O mountainous region of Seir, yes, all of Edom; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.'\"\nChapter 36\n1 \"As for you, son of man, prophesy about the mountains of Israel and say, 'O mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah. 2 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"The enemy has said against you, 'Aha!

Their ways were like the uncleanness of menstruation to me. 18 So I poured out my rage on them because of the blood that they had shed upon the land and because they made the land unclean with their disgusting idols. 19 So I scattered them among the nations and dispersed them among the lands. I judged them according to their way and according to their dealings. 20 But when they came to those nations, people profaned my holy name by saying about them, 'These are the people of Jehovah, but they had to leave his land.' 21 So I will show concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they have gone.\"\n22 \"Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"Not for your sakes am I acting, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you profaned among the nations where you have gone.\"' 23 'I will certainly sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which you profaned among them; and the nations will have to know that I am Jehovah,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'when I am sanctified among you before their eyes. 24 I will take you from the nations and gather you back from all the lands and bring you into your land. 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will become clean; I will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and from all your disgusting idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit inside you. I will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put my spirit inside you, and I will cause you to walk in my regulations, and you will observe and carry out my judicial decisions. 28 Then you will dwell in the land that I gave to your forefathers, and you will be my people and I will be your God.'\n29 \"'I will save you from all your uncleanness and summon the grain and make it abound, and I will not bring famine upon you. 30 I will make the fruitage of the tree and the produce of the field abound, so that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. 31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves because of your guilt and your detestable practices. 32 But know this: I am not doing this for your sakes,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 'Instead, be ashamed and feel humiliated because of your ways, O house of Israel.'\n33 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'In the day that I cleanse you from all your guilt, I will cause the cities to be inhabited and the ruins to be rebuilt. 34 The desolate land that was lying desolate for everyone passing by to see will be cultivated. 35 And people will say: \"The desolate land has become like the garden of Eden, and the cities that were in ruins and desolate and torn down are now fortified and inhabited.\" 36 And the nations that are left remaining around you will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have built what was torn down, and I have planted what was desolate.

As soon as I prophesied, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones began to come together, bone to bone. 8 Then I saw sinews and flesh come on them, and skin covered over them.

He had a flax cord and a measuring reed in his hand, and he was standing in the gateway. 4 The man said to me: \"Son of man, look closely, listen carefully, and pay attention to everything I show you, for that is why you were brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything that you see.\"\n5 I saw a wall surrounding the outside of the temple. In the man's hand was a measuring reed six cubits long (to each cubit, a handbreadth was added). He began to measure the wall, and its thickness was one reed and its height was one reed.\n6 Then he came to the gate that faced east and climbed its steps. When he measured the threshold of the gate, its width was one reed, and the width of the other threshold was also one reed. 7 Each guard chamber was one reed long and one reed wide, and there were five cubits between the guard chambers. The threshold of the gate beside the porch of the gate facing the interior measured one reed.\n8 He measured the porch of the gate toward the interior, and it was one reed. 9 He then measured the porch of the gate, which was eight cubits; and he measured its side pillars, which were two cubits; and the porch of the gate was on the side facing the interior.\n10 There were three guard chambers on each side of the east gate.

The interior of the porches also had windows on each side, and there were palm-tree figures on the side pillars.\n17 He then brought me into the outer courtyard, and I saw dining rooms and a pavement around the courtyard. There were 30 dining rooms on the pavement. 18 The pavement at the side of the gates corresponded to the length of the gates-this was the lower pavement.\n19 Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the perimeter of the inner courtyard. It was 100 cubits on the east and on the north.\n20 The outer courtyard had a gate facing north, and he measured its length and its width. 21 There were three guard chambers on each side. Its side pillars and porch had the same measurements as the first gate. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 22 Its windows, its porch, and its palm-tree figures were the same size as those of the east gate.

And it had palm-tree figures on its side pillars, one on each side.\n27 The inner courtyard had a gate facing south; he measured southward from gate to gate, and the distance was 100 cubits. 28 Next he brought me into the inner courtyard through the south gate; when he measured the south gate, it was the same size as the others. 29 Its guard chambers, its side pillars, and its porch were the same size as the others. There were windows on each side of it and its porch. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 30 There were porches all around; they were 25 cubits long and 5 cubits wide. 31 Its porch faced the outer courtyard, and there were palm-tree figures on its side pillars, and eight steps led up to it.\n32 When he brought me into the inner courtyard from the east, he measured the gate, and it was the same size as the others. 33 Its guard chambers, its side pillars, and its porch were the same size as the others, and there were windows on each side of it and its porch.

It had windows on each side. It was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide. 37 Its side pillars faced the outer courtyard, and there were palm-tree figures on both of its side pillars, and eight steps led up to it.\n38 A dining room with its entrance was near the side pillars of the gates, where the whole burnt offerings were washed.\n39 There were two tables on each side of the porch of the gate on which to slaughter the whole burnt offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. 40 On the way up to the north gate, there were two tables outside the entrance. There were also two tables on the other side of the porch of the gate. 41 There were four tables on each side of the gate-eight tables in all-on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. 42 The four tables for the whole burnt offering were of hewn stone. They were one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one cubit high. On them were kept the implements used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices. 43 Shelves, one handbreadth wide, were attached all around the interior walls; and the flesh of the gift offerings would be placed on the tables.\n44 Outside the inner gate were the dining rooms for the singers; they were in the inner courtyard near the north gate, facing south. Another dining room was near the east gate, facing north.\n45 He said to me: \"This dining room that faces south is for the priests who are responsible for the services in the temple. 46 The dining room that faces north is for the priests who are responsible for the service of the altar. They are the sons of Zadok, those from the Levites who are assigned to approach Jehovah to minister to him.\"\n47 Then he measured the inner courtyard. It was 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide, foursquare. The altar was in front of the temple.\n48 Then he brought me into the porch of the temple, and he measured the side pillar of the porch, and it was five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. The width of the gate was three cubits on one side and three cubits on the other side.\n49 The porch was 20 cubits long and 11 cubits wide. People would reach it by climbing the steps. There were pillars by the side posts, one on each side.\nChapter 41\n1 Then he brought me into the outer sanctuary, and he measured the side pillars; they were six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side. 2 The entrance was ten cubits wide, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. He measured its length, which was 40 cubits, and its width, 20 cubits.\n3 He then went inside and measured the side pillar of the entrance, and it was two cubits thick, and the entrance was six cubits wide. The sidewalls of the entrance were seven cubits. 4 Next he measured the room facing the outer sanctuary, and it was 20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide. And he said to me: \"This is the Most Holy.\"\n5 Then he measured the wall of the temple, and it was six cubits thick. The side chambers around the temple were four cubits wide. 6 The side chambers were three stories high, one on top of the other, with 30 chambers on each story. There were ledges around the wall of the temple that served as supports for the side chambers, so that the supports did not go into the wall of the temple itself. 7 On both sides of the temple was a winding passage that widened as it ascended to the upper chambers. The width increased from story to story as one ascended from the lowest story to the uppermost story by passing through the middle story.\n8 I saw that there was a raised platform all around the temple, and the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six cubits to the corner. 9 The width of the outside wall of the side chambers was five cubits. There was an open space alongside the structure of the side chambers that was part of the temple.\n10 Between the temple and the dining rooms was an area that was 20 cubits wide on each side. 11 There was an entrance between the side chambers and the open space on the north side and another entrance on the south side. The width of the open space was five cubits all around.\n12 The building that was on the west facing the open area was 70 cubits wide and 90 cubits long; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around.\n13 He measured the temple, and it was 100 cubits long. The open area, the building, and its walls were also 100 cubits long. 14 The width of the front of the temple facing east and the open area was 100 cubits.\n15 He measured the length of the building that faced the open area in the rear, along with its galleries on both sides, and it was 100 cubits.\nHe also measured the outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary, and the porches of the courtyard, 16 as well as the thresholds, the windows with narrowing frames, and the galleries that were in those three areas. Near the threshold were wood panels from the floor up to the windows; and the windows were covered. 17 Measurements were taken above the entrance and in the inner temple and on the outside and on the entire wall all around. 18 It had carved cherubs and palm-tree figures, with each palm tree between two cherubs, and each cherub had two faces. 19 The human face was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved this way throughout the entire temple. 20 From the floor to the area above the entrance were carved cherubs and palm-tree figures on the wall of the sanctuary.\n21 The doorposts of the sanctuary were square. In front of the holy place was something like 22 a wooden altar that was three cubits high and two cubits long. It had corner posts, and its base and its sides were made of wood. He then said to me: \"This is the table that is before Jehovah.\"\n23 The outer sanctuary and the holy place each had two doors. 24 The doors had two swinging leaves, two leaves for each door. 25 There were carved cherubs and palm-tree figures on the doors of the sanctuary, like those on the walls. There was also a wooden overhang on the front of the porch on the outside. 26 There were also windows with narrowing frames and palm-tree figures along both sides of the porch, as well as along the side chambers of the temple and the overhangs.\nChapter 42\n1 Then he led me to the outer courtyard toward the north. And he brought me to the dining-room block that was next to the open area, north of the adjoining building. 2 Its length at the north entrance was 100 cubits, and it was 50 cubits wide. 3 It was located between the inner courtyard, which was 20 cubits wide, and the pavement of the outer courtyard. Its galleries faced each other and were three stories high. 4 Before the dining rooms was an inner walkway 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long, and their entrances were to the north. 5 The upper dining rooms of the building were narrower than those in the lower and middle stories, because the galleries took up more of their space. 6 For they were three stories high, but they had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. That is why more floor space was taken away from them than from the lower and middle stories.\n7 The outer stone wall near the dining rooms toward the outer courtyard that faced the other dining rooms was 50 cubits long. 8 For the length of the dining rooms that were toward the outer courtyard was 50 cubits, but for those facing the sanctuary, it was 100 cubits. 9 The dining rooms had an entryway on the east side leading up to them from the outer courtyard.\n10 There were also dining rooms inside the stone wall of the courtyard toward the east, near the open area and the building. 11 There was a walkway before them like that of the northern dining rooms. They were the same length and width, and they had the same exits and layouts. Their entrances 12 were like the entrances of the dining rooms that were toward the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the walkway, before the adjacent stone wall toward the east, where one could enter.\n13 Then he said to me: \"The dining rooms of the north and the dining rooms of the south that are next to the open area are the holy dining rooms where the priests who are approaching Jehovah eat the most holy offerings. There they place the most holy offerings, the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, because the place is holy. 14 When the priests enter, they should not go out of the holy place to the outer courtyard without first removing the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They will clothe themselves with other garments in order to approach the areas permitted to the people.\"\n15 When he finished measuring the inner temple area, he led me out by way of the gate that faces east, and he measured the entire area.\n16 He measured the eastern side with the measuring reed. According to the measuring reed, it was 500 reed lengths from one side to the other.\n17 He measured the northern side, and according to the measuring reed, it was 500 reed lengths.\n18 He measured the southern side, and according to the measuring reed, it was 500 reed lengths.\n19 He went around to the western side. He measured 500 reed lengths with the measuring reed.\n20 He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall all around it that was 500 reeds long and 500 reeds wide, to make a division between what is holy and what is for common use.\nChapter 43\n1 Then he led me to the gate that is facing east. 2 There I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters; and the earth was illuminated by his glory. 3 What I saw was like the vision I had seen when I came to bring the city to ruin, and it appeared to be like what I had seen near the river Chebar; and I fell with my face to the ground.\n4 Then the glory of Jehovah entered the temple through the gate facing the east. 5 A spirit then raised me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and I saw that the temple had become full of the glory of Jehovah. 6 Then I heard someone speaking to me out of the temple, and the man came and stood beside me. 7 He said to me:\n\"Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the people of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no longer defile my holy name, they and their kings, by their spiritual prostitution and by the carcasses of their kings at their death. 8 By putting their threshold next to my threshold and their doorpost beside my doorpost, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my holy name by the detestable things they did, so I exterminated them in my anger. 9 Now let them put their spiritual prostitution and the carcasses of their kings far away from me, and I will dwell among them forever.\n10 \"As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they will feel ashamed because of their errors, and they should study its plan. 11 If they feel ashamed of all they have done, you should make known to them the ground plan of the temple, its arrangement, its exits, and its entrances. Show them all its ground plans and its statutes, its ground plans and its laws, and write them down before their eyes, so that they may observe all its ground plan and carry out its statutes. 12 This is the law of the temple. The entire territory all around the top of the mountain is most holy. Look! This is the law of the temple.\n13 \"These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (to each cubit a handbreadth was added). Its base is a cubit, and it is a cubit wide. It has a border all around the edge that is one span in width. This is the base of the altar. 14 From the base on the floor to the lower surrounding ledge is two cubits, and its width is one cubit. From the small surrounding ledge to the big surrounding ledge is four cubits, and its width is a cubit. 15 The altar hearth is four cubits high, and projecting up from the altar hearth are the four horns. 16 The altar hearth is square, 12 cubits long and 12 cubits wide. 17 The four sides of the surrounding ledge are 14 cubits long and 14 cubits wide; and the surrounding border is half a cubit, and its base is a cubit on all sides.\n\"And its steps are facing east.\"\n18 He then said to me, \"Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'These are the directions to follow when the altar is made, so that whole burnt offerings may be offered and blood may be sprinkled on it.'\n19 \"'You are to give a young bull of the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests of the offspring of Zadok, who approach me to minister to me,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 20 'You should take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the surrounding ledge, and on the border all around, in order to purify it from sin and to make atonement for it. 21 Then take the young bull, the sin offering, in order to burn it in the appointed place of the temple, outside the sanctuary. 22 On the second day you will offer a sound male goat as a sin offering; and they will purify the altar from sin just as they purified it from sin with the young bull.'\n23 \"'When you finish purifying it from sin, you will offer a sound young bull of the herd and a sound ram from the flock. 24 You are to present them to Jehovah, and the priests must throw salt on them and offer them up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah. 25 For seven days you will offer a male goat as a daily sin offering, as well as a young bull of the herd and a ram of the flock; you will offer unblemished animals. 26 For seven days they are to make atonement for the altar, and they must cleanse it and install it. 27 When the days are completed, on the eighth day and thereafter, the priests will offer your whole burnt offerings and communion sacrifices on the altar; and I will find pleasure in you,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\nChapter 44\n1 He brought me back by way of the outer gate of the sanctuary facing east, and it was shut. 2 Then Jehovah said to me: \"This gate will remain shut. It is not to be opened, and no human will enter by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, has entered through it, so it must remain shut. 3 However, the chieftain will sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah, for he is a chieftain. He will come in through the porch of the gate, and he will go out through it.\"\n4 Then he brought me through the north gate to the front of the temple. When I looked, I saw that the glory of Jehovah had filled the temple of Jehovah. So I fell with my face to the ground. 5 Then Jehovah said to me: \"Son of man, pay attention, watch, and listen carefully to everything I tell you about the statutes and the laws of the temple of Jehovah. Pay close attention to the entryway of the temple and all the exits of the sanctuary. 6 You must say to the rebellious house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"That is enough of your detestable practices, O house of Israel. 7 When you bring foreigners who are uncircumcised in heart and flesh into my sanctuary, they profane my temple. You present my bread, fat and blood, while my covenant is being broken because of all your detestable practices. 8 You have not taken care of my holy things. Instead, you assign others to take care of the duties in my sanctuary.\"'\n9 \"'This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"No foreigner living in Israel who is uncircumcised in heart and in flesh may enter my sanctuary.\"'\n10 \"'But the Levites who strayed far from me when Israel strayed from me to follow their disgusting idols will bear the consequences of their error. 11 And they will become ministers in my sanctuary to oversee the gates of the temple and to minister at the temple. They will slaughter the whole burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they will stand before the people to minister to them. 12 Because they ministered to them before their disgusting idols and became a stumbling block causing the house of Israel to sin, that is why I have raised my hand against them in an oath,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, 'and they will bear the consequences of their error. 13 They will not approach me to serve as my priests or approach any of my holy or most holy things, and they will bear their shame because of the detestable things that they did. 14 But I will make them caretakers of the responsibilities of the temple, to take care of its service and all the things that should be done in it.'\n15 \"'As for the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who took care of the responsibilities of my sanctuary when the Israelites strayed from me, they will approach me to minister to me, and they will stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 16 'They are the ones who will enter my sanctuary, and they will approach my table to minister to me, and they will take care of their responsibilities to me.\n17 \"'When they come into the gates of the inner courtyard, they should wear linen garments. They should not wear any wool when they minister in the gates of the inner courtyard or inside it. 18 They should wear linen turbans on their head, and linen shorts should cover their hips. They should not wear anything that makes them perspire. 19 Before they go out to the outer courtyard-the outer courtyard where the people are-they should remove the garments they were ministering in and place them in the holy dining rooms. Then they will put on other garments, so that they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments. 20 They should not shave their head or let the hair of their head grow long. They should trim the hair of their heads. 21 The priests should not drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard. 22 They should not take a widow or a divorced woman as a wife; but they may marry either a virgin of the offspring of Israel or the widow of a priest.'\n23 \"'They should instruct my people about the difference between what is holy and what is common; and they will teach them the difference between what is unclean and what is clean. 24 They should preside as judges in a legal case; they must judge it in harmony with my judicial decisions. They should keep my laws and my statutes regarding all my festivals and sanctify my sabbaths. 25 They should not approach any dead human, or they will become unclean. However, they may make themselves unclean for their father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or an unmarried sister. 26 And after the purification of a priest, they should count off seven days for him. 27 On the day he enters into the holy place, into the inner courtyard, to minister in the holy place, he should present his sin offering,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\n28 \"'And this will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance. You should not give them any possession in Israel, for I am their possession. 29 They will be the ones to eat the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, and every devoted thing in Israel will become theirs. 30 The choicest of all the first ripe fruits and every sort of contribution from you will belong to the priests. And you should give the firstfruits of your coarse meal to the priest. This will cause a blessing to rest on your households. 31 The priests should not eat any bird or animal that was found dead or torn to pieces.'\nChapter 45\n1 \"'When you allot the land as an inheritance, you should offer as a contribution to Jehovah a holy portion out of the land. Its length should be 25,000 cubits, and its width, 10,000 cubits. Its entire area will be a holy portion. 2 Within this will be a square lot for the holy place measuring 500 cubits by 500 cubits, and it will have 50 cubits as pastures on each side. 3 Out of this measurement you should measure the length of 25,000 and the width of 10,000, and within it will be the sanctuary, something most holy. 4 It will be a holy portion of the land for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who approach to minister to Jehovah. It will be a place for their houses and a sacred place for the sanctuary.\n5 \"'For the Levites, the ministers of the temple, there will be a portion 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide, and they will have 20 dining rooms as a possession.\n6 \"'You should give as the possession of the city an area that is 25,000 cubits long (corresponding to the holy contribution) and 5,000 cubits wide. It will belong to all the house of Israel.\n7 \"'And for the chieftain there will be land on both sides of the holy contribution and of the area allotted to the city. It will be next to the holy contribution and the possession of the city. It will be on the west side and on the east side. Its length from the western boundary to the eastern boundary will correspond to one of the tribal portions. 8 This land will become his possession in Israel. My chieftains will no longer mistreat my people, and they will give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.'\n9 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'You have gone far enough, chieftains of Israel!'\n\"'Put an end to your violence and oppression, and do what is just and righteous. Stop seizing the property of my people,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 10 'You should use accurate scales, an accurate ephah measure and an accurate bath measure. 11 There should be a fixed measurement for the ephah measure and the bath measure. The bath measure should hold a tenth of a homer, and the ephah measure should hold a tenth of a homer. The homer will be the standard for measuring. 12 The shekel is to be 20 gerahs. And 20 shekels plus 25 shekels plus 15 shekels will make up one maneh for you.'\n13 \"'This is the contribution that you should offer: one sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat and one sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley. 14 The allowance of the oil is to be based on the bath measure. The bath is a tenth of a cor, and ten baths are a homer, for ten baths equal a homer. 15 And from the flock of the livestock of Israel, one sheep out of every 200 should be given. These will be for the grain offering, the whole burnt offering, and the communion sacrifices, in order to make atonement for the people,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\n16 \"'All the people of the land will make this contribution to the chieftain in Israel. 17 But the chieftain will be responsible for the whole burnt offerings, the grain offering, and the drink offering during the festivals, the new moons, the Sabbaths, and all the designated festivals of the house of Israel. He will be the one to provide the sin offering, the grain offering, the whole burnt offering, and the communion sacrifices, in order to make atonement in behalf of the house of Israel.'\n18 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'In the first month, on the first day of the month, you should take a sound young bull of the herd, and you are to purify the sanctuary from sin. 19 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorpost of the temple, on the four corners of the surrounding ledge of the altar, and on the doorpost of the gate of the inner courtyard. 20 That is what you will do on the seventh day of the month because of anyone who sins by mistake or through ignorance; and you are to make atonement for the temple.\n21 \"'In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, you will observe the festival of the Passover. For seven days unleavened bread should be eaten. 22 On that day the chieftain will provide a young bull as a sin offering in his own behalf and in behalf of all the people of the land. 23 For the seven days of the festival he will provide as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah seven sound young bulls and seven sound rams each of the seven days, as well as a male goat each day as a sin offering. 24 He should also provide as a grain offering an ephah for each young bull and an ephah for each ram, as well as a hin of oil for each ephah.\n25 \"'In the seventh month, on the 15th day of the month, for seven days during the festival, he should provide the same sin offering, whole burnt offering, grain offering, and oil.'\"\nChapter 46\n1 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'The gate of the inner courtyard that is facing east should remain shut for the six workdays, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the new moon it should be opened. 2 The chieftain will enter from outside by way of the porch of the gate, and he will stand by the doorpost of the gate. The priests will offer his whole burnt offering and his communion sacrifices, and he will bow down at the threshold of the gate and then go out. But the gate should not be shut until the evening. 3 The people of the land will also bow down before Jehovah at the entrance of that gate on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.\n4 \"'The whole burnt offering that the chieftain will present to Jehovah on the Sabbath day should consist of six sound male lambs and a sound ram. 5 The grain offering will be an ephah for the ram and whatever he is able to give for the male lambs, along with a hin of oil with each ephah. 6 On the day of the new moon the offering will consist of a sound young bull of the herd, six male lambs, and a ram; they should be sound ones. 7 He should offer as a grain offering an ephah for the young bull, an ephah for the ram, and whatever he can afford for the male lambs. And he should offer a hin of oil with each ephah.\n8 \"'When the chieftain enters, he should enter by way of the porch of the gate, and he should go out the same way. 9 And when the people of the land come in before Jehovah during the festivals, those who come in to worship through the north gate should go out through the south gate, and those who come in through the south gate should go out through the north gate. No one should go back by way of the gate through which he entered, for they should exit through the gate that is opposite them. 10 As for the chieftain who is among them, he should come in when they come in, and he should go out when they go out. 11 During the festivals and the festal seasons the grain offering should be an ephah for the young bull, an ephah for the ram, and whatever he is able to give for the male lambs, along with a hin of oil with each ephah.\n12 \"'If the chieftain provides a whole burnt offering or communion sacrifices as a voluntary offering to Jehovah, the gate facing east will be opened for him, and he will provide his whole burnt offering and his communion sacrifices just as he does on the Sabbath day. After he goes out, the gate should be shut behind him.\n13 \"'Each day you should provide a sound male lamb in its first year as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah. You should do this morning by morning. 14 Along with it, each morning you should provide a sixth of an ephah as a grain offering, along with a third of a hin of oil for sprinkling on the fine flour as a regular grain offering to Jehovah. This is a lasting statute. 15 They must provide the male lamb, the grain offering, and the oil each morning as a regular whole burnt offering.'\n16 \"This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: 'If the chieftain gives a gift to each one of his sons as an inheritance, it will become the property of his sons. It is their possession by inheritance. 17 But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will be his until the year of liberty; and then it will return to the chieftain. Only the inheritance of his sons will be permanently theirs. 18 The chieftain should not take any of the inheritance of the people by forcing them off their property. He should give his sons an inheritance from his own property, so that no one among my people may be driven from his property.'\"\n19 Then he brought me in by the entryway that was beside the gate leading to the holy dining rooms of the priests, which faced north, and there I saw a place at the rear toward the west. 20 He said to me: \"This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they will bake the grain offering, so that they will not carry anything out to the outer courtyard and transmit holiness to the people.\"\n21 He brought me out to the outer courtyard and led me past the four corners of the courtyard, and I saw a courtyard by each corner of the outer courtyard. 22 At the four corners of the courtyard were small courtyards, 40 cubits long and 30 cubits wide. All four of them were the same size. 23 There were ledges all around the four of them, and beneath the ledges were built places to boil the offerings. 24 Then he said to me: \"These are the houses where the ministers of the temple boil the sacrifice of the people.\"\nChapter 47\n1 Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and there I saw water flowing eastward from under the threshold of the temple, for the front of the temple was facing east. The water was flowing down from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.\n2 He then led me out by way of the north gate and took me outside and around to the outer gate that is facing east, and I saw water trickling from the right side.\n3 When the man went out toward the east with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off 1,000 cubits and had me pass through the water; the water was ankle deep.\n4 Then he measured off another 1,000 and had me pass through the water, and it was up to the knees.\nHe measured off another 1,000 and had me pass through, and the water was up to the hips.\n5 When he measured off another 1,000, it was a torrent that I was unable to walk across, for the water was so deep that one had to swim, a torrent of water that could not be crossed on foot.\n6 He asked me: \"Have you seen this, son of man?\"\nThen he had me walk and return to the bank of the stream. 7 When I returned, I saw that on the bank of the stream were very many trees on both sides. 8 Then he said to me: \"This water flows toward the eastern region and continues down through the Arabah and enters the sea. When it enters the sea, the water there will be healed. 9 Swarms of living creatures will be able to live wherever the waters flow. There will be an abundance of fish, because this water will flow there. The seawater will be healed, and everything will live wherever the stream goes.\n10 \"Fishermen will stand beside it from En-gedi clear to En-eglaim, where there will be a drying yard for dragnets. There will be an abundance of many kinds of fish, like the fish of the Great Sea.\n11 \"It will have swampy places and marshy places, and these will not be healed. They will be abandoned to salt.\n12 \"All sorts of trees for food will grow on both banks of the stream. Their leaves will not wither; nor will their fruitage fail. Each month they will bear new fruit, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruitage will serve as food and their leaves for healing.\"\n13 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: \"This is the territory that you will assign as the land inheritance of the 12 tribes of Israel, and Joseph will have two portions. 14 You will inherit it and receive equal shares. I swore to give this land to your forefathers, and now it is assigned to you as an inheritance.\n15 \"This is the boundary of the land on the northern side: It goes from the Great Sea by the way to Hethlon toward Zedad, 16 Hamath, Berothah, and Sibraim, which is between the territory of Damascus and the territory of Hamath, to Hazer-hatticon, which is by the boundary of Hauran. 17 So the boundary will run from the sea to Hazar-enon, along the boundary of Damascus to the north, and the boundary of Hamath. This is the northern border.\n18 \"The eastern side runs between Hauran and Damascus and along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel. You should measure from the boundary to the eastern sea. This is the eastern border.\n19 \"The southern border will be from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, then to the Wadi and to the Great Sea. This is the southern border.\n20 \"On the western side is the Great Sea, from the boundary up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This is the western border.\"\n21 \"You are to apportion this land among yourselves, among the 12 tribes of Israel. 22 You should distribute it for inheritance among yourselves and to the foreigners residing with you who have had children while living among you; and they will be like native-born Israelites to you. They will receive an inheritance among the tribes of Israel along with you. 23 You should give the foreign resident an inheritance in the territory of the tribe where he has taken up residence,\" declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\nChapter 48\n1 \"These are the names of the tribes, starting from the northern extremity: Dan's portion runs along the way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath to Hazar-enan, along the boundary of Damascus northward, beside Hamath; and it extends from the eastern to the western border. 2 Asher's portion is on the boundary of Dan, from the eastern border to the western border. 3 Naphtali's portion is on the boundary of Asher, from the eastern border to the western border. 4 Manasseh's portion is on the boundary of Naphtali, from the eastern border to the western border. 5 Ephraim's portion is on the boundary of Manasseh, from the eastern border to the western border. 6 Reuben's portion is on the boundary of Ephraim, from the eastern border to the western border. 7 Judah's portion is on the boundary of Reuben, from the eastern border to the western border. 8 On the boundary of Judah, from the eastern border to the western border, the contribution that you are to set apart should be 25,000 cubits wide and correspond to the length of the other tribal portions from the eastern border to the western border. The sanctuary will be in the middle of it.\n9 \"The contribution that you are to set apart to Jehovah will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 wide. 10 This will be the holy contribution for the priests. It will be 25,000 cubits on the north side, 10,000 on the west, 10,000 on the east, and 25,000 on the south. The sanctuary of Jehovah will be in the middle of it. 11 It will be for the sanctified priests from the sons of Zadok, those who took care of their responsibilities toward me and did not go astray when the Israelites and the Levites went astray. 12 They will have a portion of the contribution of the land set apart as something most holy, on the boundary of the Levites.\n13 \"Right next to the territory of the priests, the Levites will have a portion 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 wide. (The whole length will be 25,000 long and 10,000 wide.) 14 They should not sell, exchange, or transfer any of this choicest portion of the land, for it is something holy to Jehovah.\n15 \"The remaining area that is 5,000 cubits wide alongside the 25,000 cubit border will be for common use of the city, for housing and pasture ground. The city will be in the middle of it. 16 These are the city's measurements: The northern border is 4,500 cubits, the southern border is 4,500, the eastern border is 4,500, and the western border is 4,500. 17 The pasture ground of the city will be 250 cubits to the north, 250 to the south, 250 to the east, and 250 to the west.\n18 \"The length of the remaining portion will correspond to the holy contribution, 10,000 cubits to the east and 10,000 to the west. It will correspond to the holy contribution, and its produce will provide food for those serving the city. 19 Those who are serving the city from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it.\n20 \"The whole contribution is 25,000 cubits square. You should set it aside as the holy contribution along with the possession of the city.\n21 \"What remains on both sides of the holy contribution and of the possession of the city will belong to the chieftain. It will be alongside the 25,000 cubit borders that are east and west of the contribution. It will correspond to those adjoining portions, and it will be for the chieftain. The holy contribution and the sanctuary of the temple will be in the middle of it.\n22 \"The possession of the Levites and the possession of the city will be between what belongs to the chieftain. The chieftain's territory will be between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin.\n23 \"As for the remaining tribes, Benjamin's portion is from the eastern border to the western border. 24 Simeon's portion is by the boundary of Benjamin, from the eastern border to the western border. 25 Issachar's portion is by the boundary of Simeon, from the eastern border to the western border. 26 Zebulun's portion is by the boundary of Issachar, from the eastern border to the western border. 27 Gad's portion is by the boundary of Zebulun, from the eastern border to the western border. 28 The southern border by the boundary of Gad will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the Wadi and on to the Great Sea.\n29 \"This is the land that you should distribute as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these will be their portions,\" declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\n30 \"These will be the exits of the city: The northern side will measure 4,500 cubits.\n31 \"The gates of the city will be named according to the tribes of Israel.

    "text": "Daniel\nChapter 1\n1 In the third year of the kingship of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 2 In time Jehovah gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his hand, along with some of the utensils of the house of the true God, and he brought them to the land of Shinar to the house of his god. He placed the utensils in the treasury of his god.\n3 Then the king ordered Ashpenaz his chief court official to bring some of the Israelites, including those of royal and noble descent. 4 They were to be youths without any defect, of good appearance, endowed with wisdom, knowledge, and discernment, and capable of serving in the king's palace. He was to teach them the writing and the language of the Chaldeans. 5 Furthermore, the king assigned to them a daily ration from the king's delicacies and from the wine he drank. They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to enter the king's service.\n6 Now among them were some from the tribe of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 7 And the principal court official assigned names to them; he gave to Daniel the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah the name Shadrach, to Mishael the name Meshach, and to Azariah the name Abednego.\n8 But Daniel resolved in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's delicacies or with the wine he drank. So he asked the principal court official for permission not to defile himself in this way. 9 And the true God caused the principal court official to show Daniel favor and mercy. 10 But the principal court official said to Daniel: \"I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. What if he should see you looking worse in appearance than the other youths of your age? You would make me guilty before the king.\" 11 But Daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 12 \"Please, test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink; 13 then compare our appearance with the appearance of the youths who are eating the king's delicacies, and deal with your servants according to what you see.\"\n14 So he agreed to their proposal and tested them for ten days. 15 At the end of ten days their appearance was better and healthier than all the youths who were eating the king's delicacies. 16 So the guardian would take away their delicacies and their wine and give them vegetables. 17 And the true God gave these four youths knowledge and insight into every kind of writing and wisdom; and Daniel was given understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams.\n18 At the end of the time that the king had specified to bring them in, the principal court official brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19 When the king spoke with them, no one in the entire group was found to be like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; and they continued to serve before the king. 20 In every matter requiring wisdom and understanding that the king would ask them about, he found them ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests and the conjurers in his entire realm. 21 And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.\nChapter 2\n1 In the second year of his kingship, Nebuchadnezzar had a number of dreams, and he was so agitated that he could not sleep. 2 So the king gave the order to summon the magic-practicing priests, the conjurers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. 3 Then the king said to them: \"I have had a dream, and I am agitated because I want to know what I dreamed.\" 4 The Chaldeans replied to the king in the Aramaic language: \"O king, may you live on forever. Relate the dream to your servants, and we will tell the interpretation.\"\n5 The king answered the Chaldeans: \"This is my final word: If you do not make the dream known to me, along with its interpretation, you will be dismembered, and your houses will be turned into public latrines. 6 But if you do tell the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.\"\n7 They answered a second time: \"Let the king relate the dream to his servants, and we will tell its interpretation.\"\n8 The king replied: \"I am well-aware that you are trying to gain time, for you realize what my final word is. 9 If you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one penalty for all of you. But you have agreed to tell me something false and deceitful until the situation changes. So tell me the dream, and I will know that you can explain its interpretation.\"\n10 The Chaldeans answered the king: \"There is not a man on earth who is able to do what the king demands, for no great king or governor has asked such a thing of any magic-practicing priest or conjurer or Chaldean. 11 What the king is asking is difficult, and no one exists who could tell the king this except the gods, who do not dwell among mortals.\"\n12 At this the king flew into a violent rage and gave the order to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 13 When the order was issued and the wise men were about to be killed, they also looked for Daniel and his companions to put them to death.\n14 At that time Daniel discreetly and cautiously spoke to Arioch the chief of the king's bodyguard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. 15 He asked Arioch the officer of the king: \"Why is there such a harsh order from the king?\" Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter. 16 So Daniel went in and asked the king to grant him time to tell the interpretation to the king.\n17 Daniel then went to his house and informed his companions Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the matter. 18 He asked them to pray for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions would not be destroyed along with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.\n19 Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision at night. So Daniel praised the God of heaven. 20 Daniel declared:\n\"Let the name of God be praised for all eternity,\nFor wisdom and mightiness are his alone.\n21 He changes times and seasons,\nRemoves kings and sets up kings,\nGives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those with discernment.\n22 He reveals the deep things and the hidden things,\nHe knows what is in the darkness,\nAnd with him the light dwells.\n23 To you, O God of my forefathers, I offer thanks and praise,\nBecause you have given me wisdom and power.\nAnd now you have made known to me what we requested of you;\nYou have made known to us the concern of the king.\"\n24 Daniel then went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he said to him: \"Do not destroy any wise men of Babylon. Take me in before the king, and I will tell the interpretation to the king.\"\n25 Arioch quickly took Daniel in before the king and said to him: \"I have found a man of the exiles of Judah who can make known the interpretation to the king.\" 26 The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: \"Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw, and its interpretation?\" 27 Daniel replied to the king: \"None of the wise men, conjurers, magic-practicing priests, or astrologers are able to tell the king the secret that he is asking. 28 But there is a God in the heavens who is a Revealer of secrets, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to happen in the final part of the days. This is your dream, and these are the visions of your head as you lay on your bed:\n29 \"As for you, O king, on your bed your thoughts turned to what is to take place in the future, and the Revealer of secrets has made known to you what is to happen. 30 As for me, this secret was not revealed to me because I have greater wisdom than anyone living; rather, it was to make the interpretation known to the king so that you may know the thoughts in your heart.\n31 \"You, O king, were watching, and you saw an immense image. That image, which was huge and extremely bright, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying. 32 The head of that image was of fine gold, its chest and its arms were of silver, its abdomen and its thighs were of copper, 33 its legs were of iron, and its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay. 34 You looked on until a stone was cut out, not by hands, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and of clay and crushed them. 35 At that time the iron, the clay, the copper, the silver, and the gold were, all together, crushed and became like the chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a large mountain, and it filled the whole earth.\n36 \"This is the dream, and we will now tell the king its interpretation. 37 You, O king-the king of kings to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the might, the strength, and the glory, 38 and into whose hand he has given men wherever they may dwell, as well as the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, and whom he has made ruler over all of them-you yourself are the head of gold.\n39 \"But after you another kingdom will rise, inferior to you; then another kingdom, a third one, of copper, that will rule over the whole earth.\n40 \"As for the fourth kingdom, it will be strong like iron. For just as iron crushes and pulverizes everything else, yes, like iron that shatters, it will crush and shatter all of these.\n41 \"And just as you saw the feet and the toes to be partly of clay of a potter and partly of iron, the kingdom will be divided, but some of the hardness of iron will be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with soft clay. 42 And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile. 43 Just as you saw iron mixed with soft clay, they will be mixed with the people; but they will not stick together, one to the other, just as iron does not mix with clay.\n44 \"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. And this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever, 45 just as you saw that out of the mountain a stone was cut not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the copper, the clay, the silver, and the gold. The Grand God has made known to the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.\"\n46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell down with his face to the ground before Daniel and paid homage to him. And he gave the order to offer a present and incense to him. 47 The king said to Daniel: \"Truly your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a Revealer of secrets, because you were able to reveal this secret.\" 48 The king then elevated Daniel and gave him many fine gifts, and he made him the ruler over all the province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 49 And at Daniel's request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the administration of the province of Babylon, but Daniel served in the king's court.\nChapter 3\n1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold that was 60 cubits high and 6 cubits wide. He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 2 Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces to come to the inauguration of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\n3 So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the administrators of the provinces assembled for the inauguration of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood in front of the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 4 The herald loudly proclaimed: \"You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and language groups, 5 that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 6 Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.\" 7 So when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, and all the other musical instruments, all the peoples, nations, and language groups fell down and worshipped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\n8 Now at that time some of the Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews. 9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar: \"O king, may you live on forever. 10 You, O king, gave the command that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, zither, triangular harp, stringed instrument, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments should fall down and worship the image of gold; 11 and that whoever would not fall down and worship should be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. 12 But there are certain Jews whom you appointed to administer the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men have paid no regard to you, O king. They are not serving your gods, and they refuse to worship the image of gold that you have set up.\"\n13 Then Nebuchadnezzar, in a furious rage, ordered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be brought in. So these men were brought in before the king. 14 Nebuchadnezzar said to them: \"Is it really true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you are not serving my gods and that you refuse to worship the image of gold that I have set up? 15 Now when you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the zither, the triangular harp, the stringed instrument, the bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image that I have made, fine. But if you refuse to worship, you will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who can rescue you out of my hands?\"\n16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king: \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17 If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, O king, and to rescue us from your hand. 18 But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up.\"\n19 Then Nebuchadnezzar became so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that the expression of his face changed toward them, and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual. 20 He ordered some of the mighty men from his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace.\n21 So these men were tied up while still wearing their cloaks, garments, caps, and all their other clothing, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace. 22 Because the king's command was so harsh and the furnace was exceptionally hot, the men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were the ones killed by the flames of the fire. 23 But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.\n24 King Nebuchadnezzar then became frightened and quickly rose up and said to his high officials: \"Did we not tie up three men and throw them into the fire?\" They answered the king: \"Yes, O king.\" 25 He said: \"Look! I see four men walking about free in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed, and the fourth one looks like a son of the gods.\"\n26 Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the burning fiery furnace and said: \"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, step out and come here!\" Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out from the midst of the fire. 27 And the satraps, prefects, governors, and the high officials of the king who were assembled there saw that the fire had had no effect on the bodies of these men; not a hair of their heads had been singed, their cloaks looked no different, and there was not even the smell of fire on them.\n28 Nebuchadnezzar then declared: \"Praised be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants. They trusted in him and went against the command of the king and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 29 I am therefore issuing an order that any people, nation, or language group that says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego should be dismembered, and their houses should be turned into public latrines; for there is no other god who is able to rescue like this one.\"\n30 The king then promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.\nChapter 4\n1 \"From King Nebuchadnezzar to all the peoples, nations, and language groups dwelling in all the earth: May your peace abound! 2 I am pleased to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed toward me. 3 How great are his signs, and how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his rulership is for generation after generation.\n4 \"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace. 5 I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay on my bed, the images and visions of my head frightened me. 6 So I issued an order to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon so that they could make known to me the interpretation of the dream.\n7 \"At that time the magic-practicing priests, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in. When I told them what the dream was, they could not make its interpretation known to me. 8 At last there came in before me Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god and in whom there is the spirit of the holy gods, and I told him the dream:\n9 \"'O Belteshazzar the chief of the magic-practicing priests, I well know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret is too difficult for you. So explain to me the visions I saw in my dream and its interpretation.\n10 \"'In the visions of my head while on my bed, I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was enormous. 11 The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth. 12 Its foliage was beautiful, and its fruit was abundant, and there was food on it for all. Beneath it the beasts of the field would seek shade, and on its branches the birds of the heavens would dwell, and all creatures would feed from it.\n13 \"'As I viewed the visions of my head while on my bed, I saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from the heavens. 14 He called out loudly: \"Chop down the tree, cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit! Let the beasts flee from beneath it, and the birds from its branches. 15 But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, with a banding of iron and of copper, among the grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let its portion be with the beasts among the vegetation of the earth. 16 Let its heart be changed from that of a human, and let it be given the heart of a beast, and let seven times pass over it. 17 This is by the decree of watchers, and the request is by the word of the holy ones, so that people living may know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he gives it to whomever he wants, and he sets up over it even the lowliest of men.\"\n18 \"'This was the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw; now you, O Belteshazzar, tell its interpretation, for all the other wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the interpretation known to me. But you are able to do so, because the spirit of holy gods is in you.'\n19 \"At that time Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was alarmed for a moment, and his thoughts began to frighten him.\n\"The king said, 'O Belteshazzar, do not let the dream and the interpretation frighten you.'\n\"Belteshazzar answered, 'O my lord, may the dream apply to those hating you, and its interpretation to your enemies.\n20 \"'The tree that you saw that grew great and became strong, whose top reached the heavens and was visible to all the earth, 21 which had beautiful foliage, abundant fruit, and food for all, beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell and on whose branches the birds of the heavens would reside, 22 it is you, O king, because you have grown great and become strong, and your grandeur has grown and reached to the heavens, and your rulership to the ends of the earth.\n23 \"'And the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from the heavens, who was saying: \"Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground, with a banding of iron and of copper, among the grass of the field. And let the dew of the heavens make it wet, and let its portion be with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over it.\" 24 This is the interpretation, O king; it is the decree of the Most High that must befall my lord the king. 25 You will be driven away from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field, and you will be given vegetation to eat just like bulls; and you will become wet with the dew of the heavens, and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants.\n26 \"'But because they said to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, your kingdom will be yours again after you come to know that the heavens are ruling. 27 Therefore, O king, may my counsel be acceptable to you. Turn away from your sins by doing what is right, and from your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor. It may be that your prosperity will be extended.'\"\n28 All of this befell King Nebuchadnezzar.\n29 Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon. 30 The king was saying: \"Is this not Babylon the Great that I myself have built for the royal house by my own strength and might and for the glory of my majesty?\"\n31 While the word was yet in the king's mouth, a voice came down from the heavens: \"To you it is being said, O King Nebuchadnezzar, 'The kingdom has gone away from you, 32 and from mankind you are being driven away. With the beasts of the field your dwelling will be, and you will be given vegetation to eat just like bulls, and seven times will pass over you, until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he grants it to whomever he wants.'\"\n33 At that moment the word was fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven away from mankind, and he began to eat vegetation just like bulls, and his body became wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair grew long just like eagles' feathers and his nails were like birds' claws.\n34 \"At the end of that time I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me; and I praised the Most High, and to the One living forever I gave praise and glory, because his rulership is an everlasting rulership and his kingdom is for generation after generation. 35 All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing, and he does according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth. And there is no one who can hinder him or say to him, 'What have you done?'\n36 \"At that time my understanding returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my splendor returned to me. My high officials and nobles eagerly sought me out, and I was restored to my kingdom, and even more greatness was added to me.\n37 \"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, am praising and exalting and glorifying the King of the heavens, because all his works are truth and his ways are just, and because he is able to humiliate those who are walking in pride.\"\nChapter 5\n1 As regards King Belshazzar, he held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he was drinking wine in front of them. 2 While under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave an order to bring in the vessels of gold and silver that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, his concubines and his secondary wives could drink from them. 3 Then they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his concubines and his secondary wives drank from them. 4 They drank wine, and they praised the gods of gold and silver, of copper, iron, wood, and stone.\n5 At that very moment the fingers of a man's hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace opposite the lampstand, and the king could see the back of the hand as it was writing. 6 Then the king turned pale and his thoughts terrified him, and his hips shook and his knees began to knock together.\n7 The king called out loudly to summon the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king said to the wise men of Babylon: \"Any man who reads this writing and tells me its interpretation will be clothed with purple, a gold necklace will be placed around his neck, and he will rule as the third one in the kingdom.\"\n8 Then all the wise men of the king came in, but they were not able to read the writing or to make known the interpretation to the king. 9 So King Belshazzar was very frightened and his face turned pale; and his nobles were perplexed.\n10 Because of the words of the king and his nobles, the queen entered the banqueting hall. The queen said: \"O king, may you live on forever. Do not let your thoughts terrify you, nor let your face turn pale. 11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of holy gods. In the days of your father, enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of gods were found in him. King Nebuchadnezzar your father appointed him as chief of the magic-practicing priests, conjurers, Chaldeans, and astrologers; your father did this, O king. 12 For Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, had an extraordinary spirit and knowledge and insight to interpret dreams, to explain riddles, and to solve knotty problems. Now let Daniel be summoned, and he will tell you the interpretation.\"\n13 So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king asked Daniel: \"Are you Daniel of the exiles of Judah, whom my father the king brought out of Judah? 14 I have heard concerning you that the spirit of gods is in you and that enlightenment and insight and extraordinary wisdom have been found in you. 15 Now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me to read this writing and to make its interpretation known to me, but they are not able to tell the interpretation of the message. 16 But I have heard concerning you that you are able to provide interpretations and to solve knotty problems. Now if you are able to read the writing and to make its interpretation known to me, you will be clothed with purple, a gold necklace will be placed around your neck, and you will rule as the third one in the kingdom.\"\n17 Daniel then replied to the king: \"You may keep your gifts and give your presents to others. However, I will read the writing to the king and make known its interpretation to him. 18 As for you, O king, the Most High God granted to Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and greatness and honor and majesty. 19 Because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, nations, and language groups trembled with fear before him. Whomever he wanted, he killed or let live, and whomever he wanted, he exalted or humiliated. 20 But when his heart became haughty and his spirit became hardened, so that he acted presumptuously, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and his dignity was taken away from him. 21 He was driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was given vegetation to eat just like bulls, and his body became wet with the dew of the heavens, until he came to know that the Most High God is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that he sets up over it whomever he wants.\n22 \"But you, his son Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, although you knew all of this. 23 Instead, you exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens, and you had them bring you the vessels of his house. Then you and your nobles, your concubines and your secondary wives drank wine from them and praised gods of silver and gold, of copper, iron, wood, and stone, gods that see nothing and hear nothing and know nothing. But you have not glorified the God in whose hand is your breath and all your ways. 24 So the hand was sent from him, and this writing was inscribed. 25 And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN.\n26 \"This is the interpretation of the words: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end.\n27 \"TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found lacking.\n28 \"PERES, your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.\"\n29 Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they clothed Daniel with purple and placed a gold necklace around his neck; and they heralded concerning him that he was to become the third ruler in the kingdom.\n30 That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed. 31 And Darius the Mede received the kingdom; he was about 62 years old.\nChapter 6\n1 It seemed good to Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the whole kingdom. 2 Over them were three high officials, one of whom was Daniel; and the satraps would report to them, so that the king would not suffer loss. 3 Now Daniel was distinguishing himself over the other high officials and the satraps, for there was an extraordinary spirit in him, and the king intended to elevate him over the entire kingdom.\n4 At that time the high officials and the satraps were seeking to find some grounds for accusation against Daniel respecting matters of state, but they could find no grounds for accusation or anything corrupt, for he was trustworthy and no negligence or corruption could be found in him. 5 These men then said: \"We will find in this Daniel no grounds for accusation at all, unless we find it against him in the law of his God.\"\n6 So these high officials and satraps went in as a group to the king, and they said to him: \"O King Darius, may you live on forever. 7 All the royal officials, prefects, satraps, high royal officers, and governors have consulted together to establish a royal decree and to enforce a ban, that for 30 days whoever makes a petition to any god or man except to you, O king, should be thrown into the lions' pit. 8 Now, O king, may you establish the decree and sign it, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be annulled.\"\n9 So King Darius signed the decree and the ban.\n10 But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed, he went to his house, which had the windows of his roof chamber open toward Jerusalem. And three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed and offered praise before his God, as he had regularly done prior to this. 11 At that time those men burst in and found Daniel petitioning and pleading for favor before his God.\n12 So they approached the king and reminded him about the royal ban: \"Did you not sign a ban stating that for 30 days any man who makes a petition to any god or man except to you, O king, should be thrown into the lions' pit?\" The king replied: \"The matter is well-established according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be annulled.\" 13 They immediately said to the king: \"Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judah, has paid no regard to you, O king, nor to the ban that you signed, but three times a day he is praying.\" 14 As soon as the king heard this, he was greatly distressed, and he tried to think of a way to rescue Daniel; and until the sun set he made every effort to save him. 15 Finally those men went in as a group to the king, and they said to the king: \"Take note, O king, that the law of the Medes and the Persians is that any ban or decree that the king establishes cannot be changed.\"\n16 So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the pit of lions. The king said to Daniel: \"Your God whom you are continually serving will rescue you.\" 17 Then a stone was brought and placed over the entrance of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet ring of his nobles, so that nothing could be changed with regard to Daniel.\n18 The king then went to his palace. He passed the night fasting and refused any entertainment, and he could not sleep. 19 Finally at the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions' pit. 20 As he got near the pit, he called out to Daniel with a sad voice. The king asked Daniel: \"O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you are continually serving been able to rescue you from the lions?\" 21 Daniel immediately said to the king: \"O king, may you live on forever. 22 My God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, and they have not harmed me, for I was found innocent before him; nor have I done any wrong to you, O king.\"\n23 The king was overjoyed, and he commanded that Daniel be lifted up out of the pit. When Daniel was lifted up out of the pit, he was completely unharmed, because he had trusted in his God.\n24 The king then gave an order, and the men who had accused Daniel were brought, and they were thrown into the lions' pit, along with their sons and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the pit before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\n25 Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups dwelling throughout the earth: \"May you have abundant peace! 26 I am issuing an order that in every domain of my kingdom, people are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel. For he is the living God and he endures forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his rulership is eternal. 27 He rescues, saves, and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, for he rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.\"\n28 So this Daniel prospered in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.\nChapter 7\n1 In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he recorded a complete account of the matters. 2 Daniel declared:\n\"I was watching in my visions during the night, and look! the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea. 3 And four huge beasts came out of the sea, each different from the others.\n4 \"The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet like a man, and it was given the heart of a man.\n5 \"And look! another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Get up, eat much flesh.'\n6 \"After this I kept watching, and look! another beast, like a leopard, but on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. And the beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.\n7 \"After this I kept watching in the visions of the night, and I saw a fourth beast, fearsome and terrifying and unusually strong, and it had large iron teeth. It was devouring and crushing, and what was left it trampled down with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts that were prior to it, and it had ten horns. 8 While I considered the horns, look! another horn, a small one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were plucked up from before it. And look! there were eyes like human eyes in this horn, and there was a mouth speaking arrogantly.\n9 \"I kept watching until thrones were set in place and the Ancient of Days sat down. His clothing was white like snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool. His throne was flames of fire; its wheels were a burning fire. 10 A stream of fire was flowing and going out from before him. A thousand thousands kept ministering to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The Court took its seat, and books were opened.\n11 \"I kept watching at that time because of the sound of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking; I watched until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed and it was given over to be burned in the fire. 12 But as for the rest of the beasts, their rulerships were taken away, and their lives were prolonged for a time and a season.\n13 \"I kept watching in the visions of the night, and look! with the clouds of the heavens, someone like a son of man was coming; and he gained access to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him up close before that One. 14 And to him there were given rulership, honor, and a kingdom, that the peoples, nations, and language groups should all serve him. His rulership is an everlasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom will not be destroyed.\n15 \"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was distressed within me because the visions of my head frightened me. 16 I went near to one of those who were standing there to ask him about the true meaning of this. So he replied and made known to me the interpretation of these things.\n17 \"'These huge beasts, four in number, are four kings who will stand up from the earth. 18 But the holy ones of the Supreme One will receive the kingdom, and they will possess the kingdom forever, yes, forever and ever.'\n19 \"Then I wanted to know more about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others; it was extraordinarily fearsome, with iron teeth and copper claws, and it was devouring and crushing, and trampling down what was left with its feet; 20 and about the ten horns on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly and whose appearance was bigger than that of the others.\n21 \"I kept watching as that horn made war on the holy ones, and it was prevailing against them, 22 until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was rendered in favor of the holy ones of the Supreme One, and the appointed time arrived for the holy ones to take possession of the kingdom.\n23 \"This is what he said: 'As for the fourth beast, there is a fourth kingdom that will come to be on the earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour all the earth and will trample it down and crush it. 24 As for the ten horns, ten kings will rise up out of that kingdom; and still another one will rise up after them, and he will be different from the first ones, and he will humiliate three kings. 25 He will speak words against the Most High, and he will continually harass the holy ones of the Supreme One. He will intend to change times and law, and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. 26 But the Court sat, and they took away his rulership, in order to annihilate him and to destroy him completely.\n27 \"'And the kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the Supreme One. Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all rulerships will serve and obey them.'\n28 \"This is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts alarmed me greatly, so that I turned pale; but I kept the matter in my own heart.\"\nChapter 8\n1 In the third year of the kingship of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that appeared to me previously. 2 I saw the vision, and as I watched I was in Shushan the citadel, which is in the province of Elam; I viewed the vision, and I was next to the watercourse of Ulai. 3 As I raised my eyes, look! there was a ram standing before the watercourse, and it had two horns. The two horns were tall, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up later. 4 I saw the ram making thrusts to the west and to the north and to the south, and no wild beasts could stand before it, and there was no one who could provide rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and exalted itself.\n5 As I kept watching, look! there was a male goat coming from the west crossing the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes. 6 It was coming toward the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing before the watercourse; it was running toward it in a powerful rage.\n7 I saw it closing in on the ram, and it was filled with bitterness toward it. It struck down the ram and broke its two horns, and the ram was powerless to stand up to it. It threw the ram to the ground and trampled it down, and there was no one to rescue it from its power.\n8 Then the male goat exalted itself exceedingly, but as soon as it became mighty, the great horn was broken; then four conspicuous horns came up instead of the one, toward the four winds of the heavens.\n9 Out of one of them came another horn, a small one, and it grew very great toward the south and toward the east and toward the Decoration. 10 It grew so great that it reached all the way to the army of the heavens, and it caused some of the army and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down. 11 It exalted itself even against the Prince of the army, and from him the constant feature was taken away, and the established place of his sanctuary was thrown down. 12 And an army was given over, together with the constant feature, because of transgression; and it kept throwing truth to the earth, and it acted and had success.\n13 And I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one speaking: \"How long will the vision of the constant feature and of the transgression causing desolation continue, to make both the holy place and the army things to trample on?\" 14 So he said to me: \"Until 2,300 evenings and mornings; and the holy place will certainly be restored to its right condition.\"\n15 While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and seeking to understand it, suddenly I saw standing in front of me someone who appeared to be a man. 16 Then I heard the voice of a man in the midst of the Ulai, and he called out: \"Gabriel, make that one understand what he saw.\" 17 So he came near to where I was standing, but when he came I was so terrified that I fell facedown. He said to me: \"Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.\" 18 But while he was speaking with me, I fell fast asleep with my face to the ground. So he touched me and made me stand up where I had been standing. 19 Then he said: \"Here I am causing you to know what will happen in the final part of the denunciation, because it is for the appointed time of the end.\n20 \"The two-horned ram that you saw stands for the kings of Media and Persia. 21 The hairy male goat stands for the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between its eyes stands for the first king. 22 As for the horn that was broken, so that four stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up, but not with his power.\n23 \"And in the final part of their kingdom, as the transgressors act to a completion, a fierce-looking king who understands ambiguous sayings will stand up. 24 His power will become great, but not through his own power. He will bring ruin in an extraordinary way, and he will be successful and act effectively. He will bring mighty ones to ruin, also the people made up of the holy ones. 25 And by his cunning he will use deception to succeed; and in his heart he will exalt himself; and during a time of security he will bring many to ruin. He will even stand up against the Prince of princes, but he will be broken without human hand.\n26 \"What was said in the vision about the evenings and the mornings is true, but you must keep the vision secret, for it refers to a time many days from now.\"\n27 As for me, Daniel, I felt exhausted and I was sick for some days. Then I got up and carried out the king's work; but I was numbed by what I had seen, and no one could understand it.\nChapter 9\n1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus-a descendant of the Medes who had been made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans- 2 in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, discerned by the books the number of years mentioned in the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet to fulfill the desolation of Jerusalem, namely, 70 years. 3 So I turned my face to Jehovah the true God, entreating him in prayer, along with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. 4 I prayed to Jehovah my God and made confession and said:\n\"O Jehovah the true God, the great and awe-inspiring One, who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love to those who love him and keep his commandments, 5 we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled; and we have deviated from your commandments and your judgments. 6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, our forefathers, and all the people of the land. 7 To you, O Jehovah, belongs righteousness, but to us belongs shame as is the case today, to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those nearby and far away, in all the lands to which you dispersed them because they acted unfaithfully toward you.\n8 \"O Jehovah, to us belongs shame, to our kings, our princes, and our forefathers, because we have sinned against you. 9 To Jehovah our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him. 10 We have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God by following his laws that he set before us through his servants the prophets. 11 All Israel has overstepped your Law and turned away by not obeying your voice, so that you poured out on us the curse and the sworn oath written about in the Law of Moses the servant of the true God, for we have sinned against Him. 12 He has carried out his words that he spoke against us and against our rulers who ruled over us, by bringing great calamity on us; nothing has ever been done under the whole heavens such as what was done in Jerusalem. 13 Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us, yet we have not begged for the favor of Jehovah our God by turning away from our error and by showing insight into your truth.\n14 \"So Jehovah kept watchful and brought calamity on us, for Jehovah our God is righteous in all the works that he has done; yet we have not obeyed his voice.\n15 \"Now, O Jehovah our God, the One who brought your people out of the land of Egypt by a mighty hand and made a name for yourself down to this day, we have sinned and acted wickedly. 16 O Jehovah, according to all your righteous acts, please, may your anger and wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the errors of our forefathers, Jerusalem and your people are an object of reproach to all those around us. 17 And now listen, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his entreaties, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for your own sake, O Jehovah. 18 Incline your ear, O my God, and hear! Do open your eyes and see our desolate condition and the city that has been called by your name; for we are not entreating you because of our righteous acts but because of your great mercy. 19 O Jehovah, do hear. O Jehovah, do forgive. O Jehovah, do pay attention and act! Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.\"\n20 While I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request for favor before Jehovah my God concerning the holy mountain of my God, 21 yes, while I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had previously seen in the vision, came to me when I was extremely weary at about the time of the evening gift offering. 22 And he gave me understanding, saying:\n\"O Daniel, now I have come to give you insight and understanding. 23 When you began your entreaty the word went out, and I have come to report it to you, because you are someone very precious. So consider the matter and understand the vision.\n24 \"There are 70 weeks that have been determined for your people and your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, to finish off sin, to make atonement for error, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and the prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. 25 You should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks. She will be restored and rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in times of distress.\n26 \"And after the 62 weeks, Messiah will be cut off, with nothing for himself.\n\"And the people of a leader who is coming will destroy the city and the holy place. And its end will be by the flood. And until the end there will be war; what is decided upon is desolations.\n27 \"And he will keep the covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week, he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease.\n\"And on the wing of disgusting things there will be the one causing desolation; and until an extermination, what was decided on will be poured out also on the one lying desolate.\"\nChapter 10\n1 In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel, who was called by the name Belteshazzar; and the message was true, and it was about a great conflict. And he understood the message and was given understanding about what he had seen.\n2 In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning for three full weeks. 3 I ate no rich food, and no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not put any oil on myself for three full weeks. 4 On the 24th day of the first month, while I was on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, 5 I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen, and around his waist was a belt of gold from Uphaz. 6 His body was like chrysolite, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and his feet looked like burnished copper, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude. 7 Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see the vision. However, a great trembling seized them, and they ran away and hid.\n8 Then I was left by myself, and when I saw this great vision, there was no power left in me and my dignified appearance left me and I lost all strength. 9 Then I heard the sound of him speaking; but when I heard him speaking, I fell fast asleep with my face to the ground. 10 But then a hand touched me, and it stirred me to get up on my hands and knees. 11 Then he said to me:\n\"O Daniel, you very precious man, give attention to the words that I am about to speak to you. Now stand up in your place, for I have been sent to you.\"\nWhen he said this to me, I stood up, trembling.\n12 He then said to me: \"Do not be afraid, O Daniel. Your words have been heard from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding and to humbling yourself before your God, and I have come because of your words. 13 But the prince of the royal realm of Persia stood in opposition to me for 21 days. But then Michael, one of the foremost princes, came to help me; and I remained there beside the kings of Persia. 14 I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the final part of the days, because it is a vision yet for the days to come.\"\n15 Now when he spoke these words to me, I turned my face to the ground and became speechless. 16 Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and said to the one who stood in front of me: \"My lord, I am shuddering because of the vision, and I have no strength. 17 So how can my lord's servant speak with my lord? For now I have no strength, and there is no breath left in me.\"\n18 The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me. 19 Then he said: \"Do not be afraid, O very precious man. May you have peace. Be strong, yes, be strong.\" As he spoke with me I was strengthened and I said: \"Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.\"\n20 Then he said: \"Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will go back to fight with the prince of Persia. When I leave, the prince of Greece will come. 21 However, I will tell you the things recorded in the writings of truth. There is no one strongly supporting me in these things but Michael, your prince.\nChapter 11\n1 \"As for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to strengthen and fortify him. 2 What I will tell you now is the truth:\n\"Look! Three more kings will stand up for Persia, and the fourth one will amass greater riches than all others. And when he becomes strong by means of his riches, he will rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.\n3 \"And a mighty king will stand up and rule with extensive dominion and do as he pleases. 4 But when he has stood up, his kingdom will be broken and be divided toward the four winds of the heavens, but not to his descendants and not like the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be uprooted and go to others besides these.\n5 \"And the king of the south will become strong, that is, one of his princes; but one will prevail against him and will rule with extensive dominion, greater than that one's ruling power.\n6 \"After some years they will make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north in order to make an equitable arrangement. But she will not retain the power of her arm; and he will not stand, nor his arm; and she will be given up, she and those bringing her in, and the one who caused her birth, and the one making her strong in those times. 7 And one from the sprout of her roots will stand up in his position, and he will come to the army and come against the fortress of the king of the north and will take action against them and prevail. 8 Also with their gods, with their metal images, with their desirable articles of silver and of gold, and with captives, he will come to Egypt. For some years he will stand off from the king of the north, 9 who will come against the kingdom of the king of the south, but will go back to his own land.\n10 \"As for his sons, they will prepare for war and assemble a vast, great army. He will certainly advance and sweep through like a flood. But he will go back, and he will wage war all the way to his fortress.\n11 \"And the king of the south will become bitter and will go out and fight with him, that is, with the king of the north; and he will muster a large crowd, but the crowd will be given into that one's hand. 12 And the crowd will be carried away. His heart will become exalted, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; but he will not make use of his strong position.\n13 \"And the king of the north will return and muster a crowd larger than the first; and at the end of the times, after some years, he will surely come with a large army and with many resources. 14 In those times many will stand up against the king of the south.\n\"And the violent ones among your people will be carried along to try making a vision come true; but they will stumble.\n15 \"And the king of the north will come and throw up a siege rampart and capture a fortified city. And the arms of the south will not stand, nor will his select men; and they will have no power to stand. 16 The one coming against him will do as he pleases, and no one will stand before him. He will stand in the land of the Decoration, and ability to exterminate will be in his hand. 17 He will set his face to come with the full force of his kingdom, and there will be equitable terms with him; and he will act effectively. As regards the daughter of women, it will be granted to him to bring her to ruin. And she will not stand, and she will not continue to be his. 18 He will turn his face back to the coastlands and will capture many. And a commander will make the reproach from him cease for himself, so that his reproach will not be. He will make it turn back on that one. 19 Then he will turn his face back to the fortresses of his own land, and he will stumble and fall, and he will not be found.\n20 \"And there will stand up in his position one who causes an exactor to pass through the splendid kingdom, but in a few days he will be broken, though not in anger nor in warfare.\n21 \"And there will stand up in his position a despised one, and they will not give him the majesty of the kingdom; and he will come in during a time of security and take hold of the kingdom by means of smoothness. 22 And the arms of the flood will be swept away on account of him, and they will be broken; as will be the Leader of the covenant. 23 And because of their alliance with him, he will carry on deception and rise up and become mighty by means of a little nation. 24 During a time of security he will come into the richest parts of the province and do what his fathers and their fathers have not done. Plunder and spoil and goods he will distribute among them; and against fortified places he will plot his schemes, but only for a time.\n25 \"And he will muster his power and his heart against the king of the south with a large army, and the king of the south will prepare himself for the war with an exceedingly large and mighty army. And he will not stand, because they will plot schemes against him. 26 And those eating his delicacies will bring his downfall.\n\"As for his army, it will be swept away, and many will fall down slain.\n27 \"As regards these two kings, their heart will be inclined to do what is bad, and they will sit at one table speaking lies to each other. But nothing will succeed, because the end is yet for the time appointed.\n28 \"And he will go back to his land with a great amount of goods, and his heart will be against the holy covenant. He will act effectively and go back to his land.\n29 \"At the time appointed he will return and come against the south. But this time will not be as it was before, 30 for the ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will be humbled.\n\"He will go back and hurl denunciations against the holy covenant and act effectively; and he will go back and will give attention to those leaving the holy covenant. 31 And arms will stand up, proceeding from him; and they will profane the sanctuary, the fortress, and remove the constant feature.\n\"And they will put in place the disgusting thing that causes desolation.\n32 \"And those who act wickedly against the covenant, he will lead into apostasy by means of smooth words. But the people who know their God will prevail and act effectively. 33 And those having insight among the people will impart understanding to the many. And they will be made to stumble by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plundering, for some days. 34 But when they are made to stumble, they will be given a little help; and many will join with them by means of smooth speech. 35 And some of those having insight will be made to stumble, in order to do a refining work because of them and to do a cleansing and a whitening until the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.\n36 \"The king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god; and against the God of gods he will speak astonishing things. And he will prove successful until the denunciation comes to a finish; because what is determined must take place. 37 He will show no regard for the God of his fathers; nor will he show regard for the desire of women or for any other god, but he will magnify himself over everyone. 38 But instead he will give glory to the god of fortresses; to a god that his fathers did not know he will give glory by means of gold and silver and precious stones and desirable things. 39 He will act effectively against the most fortified strongholds, along with a foreign god. He will give great glory to those who give him recognition, and he will make them rule among many; and the ground he will apportion out for a price.\n40 \"In the time of the end the king of the south will engage with him in a pushing, and against him the king of the north will storm with chariots and horsemen and many ships; and he will enter into the lands and sweep through like a flood. 41 He will also enter into the land of the Decoration, and many lands will be made to stumble. But these are the ones that will escape out of his hand: Edom and Moab and the main part of the Ammonites. 42 And he will keep thrusting out his hand against the lands; and as regards the land of Egypt, she will not escape. 43 And he will rule over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the desirable things of Egypt. And the Libyans and the Ethiopians will be at his steps.\n44 \"But reports out of the east and out of the north will disturb him, and he will go out in a great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction. 45 And he will plant his royal tents between the grand sea and the holy mountain of Decoration; and he will come all the way to his end, and there will be no helper for him.\nChapter 12\n1 \"During that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who is standing in behalf of your people. And there will occur a time of distress such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.

As soon as the dashing to pieces of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these things will come to their finish.\"\n8 Now as for me, I heard, but I could not understand; so I said: \"O my lord, what will be the outcome of these things?\"\n9 Then he said: \"Go, Daniel, because the words are to be kept secret and sealed up until the time of the end. 10 Many will cleanse themselves and whiten themselves and will be refined.

    "text": "Hosea\nChapter 1\n1 The word of Jehovah that came to Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, the king of Israel. 2 When Jehovah started to speak his word through Hosea, Jehovah said to Hosea: \"Go, marry a woman of prostitution and have children of prostitution, because by prostitution the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah.\"\n3 So he went and married Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.\n4 Then Jehovah said to him: \"Name him Jezreel, for in a little while I will hold an accounting against the house of Jehu for the acts of bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the royal rule of the house of Israel. 5 In that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.\"\n6 She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And He told him: \"Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer show mercy to the house of Israel, because I will certainly drive them away. 7 But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, and I will save them by Jehovah their God; I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.\"\n8 After weaning Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. 9 Then He said: \"Name him Lo-ammi, because you are not my people and I will not be yours.\n10 \"And the number of the people of Israel will be like the grains of sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. And in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' it will be said to them, 'The sons of the living God.' 11 And the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together into unity and will choose for themselves one head and go up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.\nChapter 2\n1 \"Say to your brothers, 'My people!'\nAnd to your sisters, 'O woman shown mercy!'\n2 Accuse your mother; accuse her,\nFor she is not my wife and I am not her husband.\nShe should remove her prostitution from herself\nAnd her adultery from between her breasts,\n3 Or I will strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born,\nMaking her like a wilderness,\nReducing her to a waterless land,\nAnd causing her to die of thirst.\n4 And to her sons I will not show mercy,\nFor they are the sons of prostitution.\n5 For their mother has committed prostitution.\nShe who was pregnant with them has acted shamefully, for she said,\n'I will go after my passionate lovers,\nThose who give me my bread and my water,\nMy wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.'\n6 So I will block your way with a hedge of thorns;\nAnd I will raise up a stone wall against her,\nSo that she cannot find her paths.\n7 She will chase after her passionate lovers, but she will not overtake them;\nShe will look for them, but she will not find them.\nThen she will say, 'I will go back to my first husband,\nFor I was better off at that time than I am now.'\n8 She did not recognize that it was I who had given her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,\nAnd I who had given her silver in abundance\nAnd gold, which they used for Baal.\n9 'Therefore, I will return and take away my grain in its time\nAnd my new wine in its season,\nAnd I will snatch away my wool and my linen that were to cover her nakedness.\n10 Now I will expose her private parts in full view of her passionate lovers,\nAnd no man will rescue her out of my hand.\n11 I will put an end to all her joy,\nHer festivals, her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her festive seasons.\n12 And I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said:\n\"These are my wages, which my passionate lovers gave to me\";\nI will turn them into a forest,\nAnd the wild animals of the field will devour them.\n13 I will hold an accounting against her for the days when she offered sacrifices to the Baal images,\nWhen she would adorn herself with her rings and ornaments and would chase after her passionate lovers,\nAnd I was the one she forgot,' declares Jehovah.\n14 'So I will persuade her,\nI will lead her into the wilderness,\nAnd I will speak to win her heart.\n15 I will give her vineyards back to her from that time onward,\nAnd the Valley of Achor as a gateway to hope;\nShe will answer there as in the days of her youth,\nAs in the day when she came out of the land of Egypt.\n16 And in that day,' declares Jehovah,\n'You will call me My husband, and you will no longer call me My master.'\n17 'I will remove the names of the Baal images from her mouth,\nAnd they will no longer be remembered by their name.\n18 In that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals of the field,\nAnd with the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the ground;\nI will rid the land of the bow and the sword and war,\nAnd I will make them lie down in security.\n19 I will engage myself to you forever;\nAnd I will engage myself to you in righteousness and in justice,\nIn loyal love and in mercy.\n20 I will engage myself to you in faithfulness,\nAnd you will certainly know Jehovah.'\n21 'In that day I will answer,' declares Jehovah,\n'I will answer the heavens,\nAnd they will answer the earth;\n22 And the earth will answer the grain and the new wine and the oil;\nAnd they will answer Jezreel.\n23 I will sow her like seed for myself in the earth,\nAnd I will show mercy to her who was not shown mercy;\nI will say to those not my people: \"You are my people,\"\nAnd they will say: \"You are my God.\"'\"\nChapter 3\n1 Then Jehovah said to me: \"Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery, just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel while they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.\"\n2 So I purchased her for myself for 15 silver pieces and a homer measure and a half of barley. 3 Then I said to her: \"You will remain mine for many days. You must not commit prostitution, and you must not have relations with another man, and I will behave the same way toward you.\"\n4 It is because for a long time the people of Israel will dwell without a king, without a prince, without a sacrifice, without a pillar, and without an ephod and teraphim statues. 5 Afterward the people of Israel will come back and look for Jehovah their God and for David their king, and they will come trembling to Jehovah and to his goodness in the final part of the days.\nChapter 4\n1 Hear the word of Jehovah, O people of Israel,\nFor Jehovah has a legal case against the inhabitants of the land,\nBecause there is no truth nor loyal love nor knowledge of God in the land.\n2 False oaths and lying and murder\nAnd stealing and adultery are widespread,\nAnd one act of bloodshed follows another act of bloodshed.\n3 That is why the land will mourn\nAnd every inhabitant in it will waste away;\nThe wild animals of the field and the birds of the heavens,\nEven the fish of the sea, will perish.\n4 \"However, let no man contend or reprove,\nFor your people are like those who contend against a priest.\n5 So you will stumble in broad daylight,\nAnd the prophet will stumble with you, as if it were night.\nAnd I will silence your mother.\n6 My people will be silenced, because there is no knowledge.\nBecause you have rejected knowledge,\nI will also reject you from serving as my priest;\nAnd because you have forgotten the law of your God,\nI myself will forget your sons.\n7 The more they increased, the more they sinned against me.\nI will change their glory into disgrace.\n8 They feed on the sin of my people,\nAnd they are greedy for their error.\n9 It will be the same for the people as for the priest;\nI will call them to account for their ways,\nAnd I will bring on them the consequences of their actions.\n10 They will eat but not be satisfied.\nThey will be promiscuous, but they will not increase,\nBecause they have shown no regard for Jehovah.\n11 Prostitution and wine and new wine\nTake away the motivation to do what is right.\n12 My people consult their wooden idols,\nDoing what their staff tells them;\nBecause the spirit of prostitution causes them to go astray,\nAnd by their prostitution they refuse to submit to their God.\n13 On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice,\nAnd on the hills they make sacrifices smoke,\nUnder oak trees and storax trees and every big tree,\nBecause their shade is good.\nThat is why your daughters commit prostitution\nAnd your daughters-in-law commit adultery.\n14 I will not hold an accounting against your daughters because of their prostitution,\nAnd against your daughters-in-law because of their adultery.\nFor the men go off with the harlots\nAnd sacrifice with the temple prostitutes;\nSuch a people without understanding will come to ruin.\n15 Although you are committing prostitution, O Israel,\nLet not Judah become guilty.\nDo not come to Gilgal or to Beth-aven,\nAnd do not swear, 'As surely as Jehovah is alive!'\n16 For like a stubborn cow, Israel has become stubborn.\nWill Jehovah now shepherd them like a young ram in an open pasture?\n17 Ephraim is joined to idols.\nLet him alone!\n18 When their beer is finished,\nThey become promiscuous.\nAnd her rulers dearly love dishonor.\n19 The wind will wrap her in its wings,\nAnd they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.\"\nChapter 5\n1 \"Hear this, you priests,\nPay attention, O house of Israel,\nListen, O house of the king,\nFor the judgment involves you;\nBecause you are a trap to Mizpah\nAnd a net spread over Tabor.\n2 And those falling away have sunk deep in slaughter,\nAnd I am warning all of them.\n3 I know Ephraim,\nAnd Israel is not hidden from me.\nFor now, O Ephraim, you have acted promiscuously;\nIsrael has defiled itself.\n4 Their dealings do not permit them to return to their God,\nBecause there is a spirit of prostitution among them;\nAnd Jehovah they do not acknowledge.\n5 The pride of Israel has testified against him;\nBoth Israel and Ephraim have stumbled in their error,\nAnd Judah has stumbled with them.\n6 With their flock and their herd they went to look for Jehovah,\nBut they could not find him.\nHe had drawn away from them.\n7 They have betrayed Jehovah,\nFor they have fathered foreign sons.\nNow a month will devour them and their portions.\n8 Blow a horn in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah!\nShout a war cry at Beth-aven-after you, O Benjamin!\n9 O Ephraim, you will become an object of horror in the day of punishment.\nI have made known what will surely happen among the tribes of Israel.\n10 The princes of Judah are like those moving a boundary.\nI will pour out my fury on them like water.\n11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed by judgment,\nFor he was determined to follow after his adversary.\n12 So I was like a moth to Ephraim\nAnd like rottenness to the house of Judah.\n13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his ulcer,\nEphraim went to Assyria and sent to a great king.\nBut he was unable to heal you,\nAnd he could not cure your ulcer.\n14 For I will be like a young lion to Ephraim,\nAnd like a strong lion to the house of Judah.\nI myself will tear to pieces and go away;\nI will carry them off, and no one will rescue them.\n15 I will go away and return to my place until they bear the consequences of their guilt,\nAnd then they will seek my favor.\nWhen they are in distress, they will seek me.\"\nChapter 6\n1 \"Come, and let us return to Jehovah,\nFor he has torn us to pieces, but he will heal us.\nHe struck us, but he will bind our wounds.\n2 He will revive us after two days.\nOn the third day he will raise us up,\nAnd we will live before him.\n3 We will know, we will earnestly seek to know Jehovah.\nHis going out is as certain as the dawn;\nHe will come to us like a pouring rain,\nLike a spring rain that saturates the earth.\"\n4 \"What should I do with you, Ephraim?\nWhat should I do with you, Judah?\nFor your loyal love is like the morning clouds,\nLike the dew that quickly vanishes.\n5 That is why I will cut them down by means of the prophets;\nI will kill them with the words of my mouth.\nAnd the judgments on you will shine as the light.\n6 For in loyal love I delight, not in sacrifice,\nAnd in the knowledge of God, rather than in whole burnt offerings.\n7 But they, like mere men, have violated the covenant.\nThere they have betrayed me.\n8 Gilead is a town of evildoers,\nCovered with footprints of blood.\n9 The company of priests are like marauder bands lying in ambush for a man.\nThey murder on the road at Shechem,\nFor their conduct is shameful.\n10 I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel.\nThere Ephraim practices prostitution;\nIsrael has defiled itself.\n11 Furthermore, O Judah, a harvest is set for you,\nWhen I gather back the captives of my people.\"\nChapter 7\n1 \"At the time when I would heal Israel,\nThe error of Ephraim is also exposed,\nAnd the wickedness of Samaria.\nFor they practice deception;\nThieves break in and marauder bands raid outside.\n2 But they do not say in their heart that I will remember all their wickedness.\nNow their dealings are all around them;\nThey are right in front of my face.\n3 They make the king rejoice by their wickedness,\nAnd princes by their deceit.\n4 All of them are adulterers,\nBurning like an oven fired by a baker,\nWho stops stirring the fire after kneading the dough until it is leavened.\n5 On the day of our king, princes have become sick\n-They are enraged because of wine.\nHe has reached out his hand to ridiculers.\n6 For they approach with hearts burning like an oven.\nAll night long the baker sleeps;\nIn the morning the oven blazes like a flaming fire.\n7 All of them are hot like an oven,\nAnd they devour their rulers.\nAll their kings have fallen;\nNo one among them calls out to me.\n8 Ephraim mixes with the nations.\nEphraim is like a round cake left unturned.\n9 Strangers have consumed his strength, but he does not know it.\nAnd his gray hairs have turned white, but he does not notice it.\n10 The pride of Israel has testified against him,\nBut they have not returned to Jehovah their God,\nNor have they looked for him despite all of this.\n11 Ephraim is like a simpleminded dove, lacking good sense.\nThey have called out to Egypt; they have gone to Assyria.\n12 Wherever they go, I will spread my net over them.\nI will bring them down like the birds of the heavens.\nI will discipline them according to the warning given to their assembly.\n13 Woe to them, for they have fled from me!\nDevastation to them, for they have transgressed against me!\nI was ready to redeem them, but they have spoken lies against me.\n14 From their heart they did not call to me for help,\nAlthough they kept wailing on their beds.\nFor their grain and new wine they would slash themselves;\nThey turn against me.\n15 Although I disciplined them and strengthened their arms,\nThey are against me, scheming what is bad.\n16 They changed course, but not to anything loftier;\nThey were as unreliable as a loose bow.\nTheir princes will fall by the sword because of their defiant tongues.\nFor this they will be an object of ridicule in the land of Egypt.\"\nChapter 8\n1 \"Put a horn to your mouth!\nOne comes like an eagle against the house of Jehovah,\nFor they have violated my covenant and transgressed against my law.\n2 To me they cry out, 'My God, we, Israel, know you!'\n3 Israel has rejected what is good.\nLet an enemy pursue him.\n4 They have appointed kings, but not through me.\nThey have appointed princes, but I did not recognize them.\nWith their silver and their gold they have made idols,\nTo their own destruction.\n5 Your calf has been rejected, O Samaria.\nMy anger flares up against them.\nHow long will they be incapable of innocence?\n6 For this is from Israel.\nA craftsman made it, and it is not God;\nThe calf of Samaria will be reduced to splinters.\n7 For it is wind that they are sowing,\nAnd they will reap a storm wind.\nNo stalk produces ripe grain;\nWhatever sprouts produces no flour.\nIf any is produced, foreigners will swallow it down.\n8 Israel will be swallowed down.\nNow they will be among the nations,\nLike an unwanted vessel.\n9 For they have gone up to Assyria, like a lone wild donkey.\nEphraim has hired lovers.\n10 Although they hire them from among the nations,\nI will now round them up;\nThey will begin to suffer because of the burden imposed by king and princes.\n11 For Ephraim has multiplied altars to sin.\nThey became his altars for sinning.\n12 I wrote for him the many things of my law,\nBut they were regarded as something strange.\n13 They offer sacrificial gifts to me, and they eat the meat,\nBut Jehovah takes no pleasure in them.\nNow he will remember their error and punish them for their sins.\nThey have turned back to Egypt.\n14 Israel has forgotten his Maker and has built temples,\nAnd Judah has multiplied fortified cities.\nBut I will send fire into his cities,\nAnd it will consume the towers of each one.\"\nChapter 9\n1 \"Do not rejoice, O Israel,\nDo not act joyfully like the peoples.\nFor by prostitution you have strayed from your God.\nYou have loved the wages of a prostitute on every threshing floor of grain.\n2 But the threshing floor and winepress will not feed them,\nAnd new wine will fail her.\n3 They will not continue dwelling in the land of Jehovah;\nInstead, Ephraim will return to Egypt,\nAnd in Assyria they will eat what is unclean.\n4 They will no longer pour out wine offerings to Jehovah;\nTheir sacrifices will not please him.\nThey are like the bread of mourning;\nAll those eating it will defile themselves.\nFor their bread is for themselves alone;\nIt will not come into the house of Jehovah.\n5 What will you do in the day of meeting,\nIn the day of Jehovah's festival?\n6 For look! they will have to flee because of destruction.\nEgypt will gather them together, and Memphis will bury them.\nNettles will take possession of their precious things of silver,\nAnd thornbushes will be in their tents.\n7 The days of reckoning will come,\nThe days of retribution will come,\nAnd Israel will know it.\nTheir prophet will be a fool, and the man of inspiration will go mad;\nBecause your error is abundant, the animosity against you is abundant.\"\n8 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God.\nBut now all the ways of his prophets are as the traps of a birdcatcher;\nThere is animosity in the house of his God.\n9 They have sunk deep into ruin, as in the days of Gibeah.\nHe will remember their error and punish their sins.\n10 \"Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel.\nLike the first of the early figs on a fig tree I saw your forefathers.\nBut they went to Baal of Peor;\nThey dedicated themselves to the shameful thing,\nAnd they became disgusting like the object of their love.\n11 Ephraim's glory flies away like a bird;\nThere is no giving birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.\n12 Even if they raise children,\nI will bereave them until no man is left;\nYes, woe to them when I turn away from them!\n13 Ephraim, planted in a pasture, was to me like Tyre;\nNow Ephraim must bring his sons out to the slaughter.\"\n14 Give them, O Jehovah, what you should give them;\nA womb that miscarries and dry breasts.\n15 \"All their wickedness was in Gilgal, for there I came to hate them.\nI will drive them away from my house because of their evil deeds.\nI will no longer love them;\nAll their princes are stubborn.\n16 Ephraim will be struck down.\nTheir root will dry up, and they will produce no fruit.\nEven if they give birth, I will put to death their cherished offspring.\"\n17 My God will reject them,\nFor they have not listened to him,\nAnd they will become fugitives among the nations.\nChapter 10\n1 \"Israel is a degenerate vine yielding its fruit.\nThe more his fruit increases, the more he multiplies his altars;\nThe better his land produces, the more splendid his sacred pillars.\n2 Their heart is hypocritical;\nNow they will be found guilty.\nThere is one who will break their altars and destroy their pillars.\n3 Now they will say, 'We have no king, for we have not feared Jehovah.\nAnd what could a king do for us?'\n4 They speak empty words, make false oaths, and make covenants;\nSo the judgment that springs up is like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.\n5 The residents of Samaria will fear for the calf idol of Beth-aven.\nIts people will mourn over it,\nAs will its foreign-god priests who rejoiced over it and its glory,\nFor it will go away from them into exile.\n6 It will be brought to Assyria as a gift to a great king.\nEphraim will be put to shame,\nAnd Israel will be ashamed because of the advice it followed.\n7 Samaria and her king will certainly be done away with,\nLike a snapped-off twig on the surface of waters.\n8 The high places of Beth-aven, the sin of Israel, will be annihilated.\nThorns and thistles will grow on their altars.\nPeople will say to the mountains, 'Cover us!'\nAnd to the hills, 'Fall over us!'\n9 From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel.\nThere they have persisted.\nWar did not overtake the sons of unrighteousness in Gibeah.\n10 I will also discipline them when I please.\nAnd peoples will be gathered against them,\nWhen their two errors are harnessed on them.\n11 Ephraim was a trained heifer that loved to thresh,\nSo I spared her fair neck.\nNow I will make someone ride Ephraim.\nJudah will plow; Jacob will harrow for him.\n12 Sow seed for yourselves in righteousness and reap loyal love.\nPlow for yourselves arable land\nWhile there is time to search for Jehovah,\nUntil he comes and instructs you in righteousness.\n13 But you have plowed wickedness,\nYou have reaped unrighteousness,\nAnd you have eaten the fruitage of deception;\nFor you have trusted in your own way,\nIn the multitude of your warriors.\n14 An uproar will rise against your people,\nAnd your fortified cities will all be devastated,\nLike the devastation by Shalman of the house of Arbel,\nIn the day of battle when mothers were dashed to pieces alongside their children.\n15 This is what will be done to you, O Bethel, because of your utter wickedness.\nAt dawn the king of Israel will surely be done away with.\"\nChapter 11\n1 \"When Israel was a boy, I loved him,\nAnd out of Egypt I called my son.\n2 The more they called them,\nThe more they went away from them.\nThey kept sacrificing to the Baal images\nAnd offering sacrifices to the graven images.\n3 But it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in my arms;\nAnd they did not acknowledge that I had healed them.\n4 With the ropes of men I kept drawing them, with the cords of love;\nAnd I was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jaws,\nAnd I gently brought food to each one.\n5 They will not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria will be their king,\nBecause they refused to return to me.\n6 And a sword will whirl against his cities\nAnd destroy his bars and devour them because of their schemes.\n7 My people are bent on unfaithfulness to me.\nThough they called them upward, no one rises up.\n8 How can I give you up, O Ephraim?\nHow can I hand you over, O Israel?\nHow can I treat you like Admah?\nHow can I make you like Zeboiim?\nI have had a change of heart;\nAt the same time my compassions are stirred.\n9 I will not vent my burning anger.\nI will not destroy Ephraim again,\nFor I am God and not man,\nThe Holy One in your midst;\nAnd I will not come against you in fury.\n10 They will walk after Jehovah, and he will roar like a lion;\nWhen he roars, his sons will come trembling from the west.\n11 They will tremble like a bird when they come out of Egypt,\nLike a dove out of the land of Assyria;\nAnd I will settle them in their houses,\" declares Jehovah.\n12 \"Ephraim has surrounded me with lies,\nAnd the house of Israel with deceit.\nBut Judah still roams with God,\nAnd he is faithful to the Most Holy One.\"\nChapter 12\n1 \"Ephraim is feeding on wind.\nHe chases after the east wind all day long.\nHe multiplies lies and violence.\nThey make a covenant with Assyria and take oil to Egypt.\n2 Jehovah has a legal case against Judah;\nHe will call for an accounting against Jacob according to his ways,\nAnd he will repay him according to his deeds.\n3 In the womb he seized his brother by the heel,\nAnd with his vigor he contended with God.\n4 He kept contending with an angel and prevailed.\nHe wept and begged for his favor.\"\nHe found him at Bethel, and there He spoke with us,\n5 Jehovah the God of armies,\nJehovah is his memorial name.\n6 \"So return to your God,\nMaintain loyal love and justice,\nAnd always hope in your God.\n7 But in the hand of the tradesman are deceptive scales;\nHe loves to defraud.\n8 Ephraim keeps saying, 'Indeed, I have become rich;\nI have found wealth.\nAnd in all my toil, they will not find anything wrong or sinful.'\n9 But I am Jehovah your God from the land of Egypt.\nI will again make you dwell in tents\nAs in the days of an appointed time.\n10 I spoke to the prophets,\nI multiplied their visions,\nAnd I spoke parables through the prophets.\n11 With Gilead there has been deception and untruth.\nIn Gilgal they have sacrificed bulls,\nAnd their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the field.\n12 Jacob ran away to the territory of Aram;\nIsrael served there for a wife,\nAnd for a wife he guarded sheep.\n13 By a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt,\nAnd by a prophet he was guarded.\n14 Ephraim has caused bitter offense;\nHis bloodguilt remains on him;\nHis Lord will repay him for his reproach.\"\nChapter 13\n1 \"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling;\nHe was prominent in Israel.\nBut he became guilty with regard to Baal and died.\n2 Now they add to their sin\nAnd make metal statues from their silver;\nThey skillfully make idols, all the work of craftsmen.\nTo them they say, 'Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.'\n3 So they will become like the morning clouds,\nLike the dew that vanishes early,\nLike chaff blown from the threshing floor by a storm,\nAnd like smoke out of the hole in the roof.\n4 But I am Jehovah your God from the land of Egypt;\nYou knew no God except me,\nAnd besides me there is no savior.\n5 I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.\n6 They were satisfied with their pastures,\nThey were satisfied and their heart became proud.\nAnd so they forgot me.\n7 I will become like a young lion to them,\nLike a leopard lurking along the path.\n8 I will come upon them like a bear that has lost its cubs,\nAnd I will rip open their chest.\nI will devour them there like a lion;\nA wild beast of the field will tear them to pieces.\n9 It will destroy you, O Israel,\nBecause you turned against me, against your helper.\n10 Where, then, is your king, that he may save you in all your cities,\nAnd your rulers, of whom you said,\n'Give me a king and princes'?\n11 I gave you a king in my anger,\nAnd I will take him away in my fury.\n12 The error of Ephraim is wrapped up;\nHis sin is stored up.\n13 The pangs of childbirth will come for him.\nBut he is an unwise child;\nHe does not present himself when it is time to be born.\n14 From the power of the Grave I will redeem them;\nFrom death I will recover them.\nWhere are your stings, O Death?\nWhere is your destructiveness, O Grave?\nCompassion will be concealed from my eyes.\n15 Even if he should flourish among the reeds,\nAn east wind will come, the wind of Jehovah,\nFrom the desert it comes, to dry up his well and drain his spring.\nThat one will pillage the treasury of all his precious things.\n16 Samaria will be held guilty, for she has rebelled against her God.\nBy the sword they will fall,\nTheir children will be dashed to pieces,\nAnd their pregnant women will be ripped open.\"\nChapter 14\n1 \"Come back, O Israel, to Jehovah your God,\nFor you have stumbled because of your error.\n2 Come back to Jehovah with these words,\nSay to him, 'May you pardon our error and accept what is good,\nAnd we will offer the praise of our lips as we would young bulls.\n3 Assyria will not save us.\nWe will not ride on horses,\nAnd we will no longer say, \"O our God!\" to the work of our hands,\nFor it is by you that the fatherless child is shown mercy.'\n4 I will heal their unfaithfulness.\nI will love them of my own free will,\nBecause my anger has turned away from him.\n5 I will become like the dew to Israel;\nHe will blossom like the lily\nAnd will send down his roots like the trees of Lebanon.\n6 His twigs will spread,\nHis splendor will be like that of the olive tree,\nAnd his fragrance like that of Lebanon.\n7 They will again dwell in his shadow.\nThey will grow grain and will bud like the vine.\nHis fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.\n8 Ephraim will say, 'What more do I have to do with idols?'\nI will answer and watch over him.\nI will be like a thriving juniper tree.\nFrom me your fruit will be found.\"\n9 Who is wise? Let him understand these things.\nWho is discreet? Let him know them.\nFor the ways of Jehovah are upright,\nAnd the righteous will walk in them;\nBut the transgressors will stumble in them. \n",

It is near!\n2 It is a day of darkness and gloom,\nA day of clouds and thick gloom,\nLike light of dawn spreading out on the mountains.\nThere is a people numerous and mighty;\nNever before has there been one like it,\nAnd never again will there be another\nThrough the years of all generations.\n3 Ahead of it a fire devours,\nAnd behind it a flame consumes.\nThe land ahead of it is like the garden of Eden,\nBut behind it is a desolate wilderness,\nAnd nothing can escape.\n4 Its appearance is like the appearance of horses,\nAnd they run like warhorses.\n5 The sound is like that of chariots as they leap on the mountaintops,\nLike the crackling of a blazing fire that consumes stubble.\nIt is like a mighty people drawn up in battle formation.\n6 Because of them, peoples will be in anguish.\nEvery face will grow flushed.\n7 They charge like warriors,\nThey scale a wall like soldiers,\nEach keeps to his own course,\nAnd they do not swerve from their paths.\n8 They do not shove one another;\nEach man advances in his course.\nIf the weapons cause some to fall,\nThe others do not break ranks.\n9 Into the city they rush, on the wall they run.\nOnto the houses they climb, through the windows they enter like a thief.\n10 Before them the land trembles and the heavens rock.\nSun and moon have become dark,\nAnd the stars have lost their brightness.\n11 Jehovah will raise his voice before his army, for his camp is very numerous.\nFor the one carrying out His word is mighty;\nFor the day of Jehovah is great and very awe-inspiring.\nWho can endure it?\"\n12 \"Yet even now,\" declares Jehovah, \"return to me with all your hearts,\nWith fasting and weeping and wailing.\n13 Rip apart your hearts, and not your garments,\nAnd return to Jehovah your God,\nFor he is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love,\nAnd he will reconsider the calamity.\n14 Who knows whether he will turn back and reconsider\nAnd leave behind a blessing,\nA grain offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God?\n15 Blow a horn in Zion!\nProclaim a fast; call for a solemn assembly.\n16 Gather the people; sanctify the congregation.\nCollect the old men; gather the children and nursing infants.\nLet the bridegroom go out from his inner chamber, and the bride from her bridal chamber.\n17 Between the porch and the altar\nLet the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep and say:\n'Do feel pity, O Jehovah, for your people;\nDo not make your inheritance an object of scorn,\nLetting the nations rule over them.\nWhy should the peoples say, \"Where is their God?\"'\n18 Then Jehovah will be zealous for his land\nAnd show compassion on his people.\n19 Jehovah will answer his people:\n'Here I am sending to you grain and new wine and oil,\nAnd you will be fully satisfied;\nI will no longer make you a reproach among the nations.\n20 I will drive the northerner far away from you;\nI will disperse him to a dry and desolate wasteland,\nWith his vanguard toward the eastern sea\nAnd his rear guard toward the western sea.\nThe foul smell from him will ascend,\nThe stench from him will keep ascending;\nFor He will do great things.'\n21 Do not be afraid, O land.\nBe joyful and rejoice, for Jehovah will do great things.\n22 Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field,\nFor the pastures of the wilderness will become green,\nAnd the trees will bear fruit;\nThe fig tree and the vine must give their full yield.\n23 You sons of Zion, be joyful and rejoice in Jehovah your God;\nFor he will give you the autumn rain in the right amount,\nAnd he will send upon you a downpour,\nThe autumn rain and the spring rain, as before.\n24 The threshing floors will be full of pure grain,\nAnd the presses will overflow with new wine and oil.\n25 And I will make compensation to you for the years\nThat the swarming locust, the unwinged locust, the voracious locust, and the devouring locust have eaten,\nMy great army that I sent among you.\n26 You will surely eat to satisfaction,\nAnd you will praise the name of Jehovah your God,\nWho has done wonders in your behalf;\nMy people will never again be put to shame.\n27 And you will have to know that I am in the midst of Israel\nAnd that I am Jehovah your God-there is no other!\nMy people will never again be put to shame.\n28 After that I will pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh,\nAnd your sons and your daughters will prophesy,\nYour old men will dream dreams,\nAnd your young men will see visions.\n29 And even on my male slaves and female slaves\nI will pour out my spirit in those days.\n30 And I will give wonders in the heavens and on the earth,\nBlood and fire and columns of smoke.\n31 The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood\nBefore the coming of the great and awe-inspiring day of Jehovah.\n32 And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved;\nFor on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, just as Jehovah has said,\nThe survivors whom Jehovah calls.\"\nChapter 3\n1 \"For look! in those days and in that time,\nWhen I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,\n2 I will also gather together all the nations\nAnd bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.\nI will enter into judgment with them there\nIn behalf of my people and my inheritance Israel,\nFor they scattered them among the nations,\nAnd they divided up my land among themselves.\n3 For my people they cast lots;\nThey would trade a boy to hire a prostitute\nAnd sell a girl for wine to drink.\n4 Also, what do you have against me,\nO Tyre and Sidon and all the regions of Philistia?\nAre you repaying me for something?\nIf you are repaying me,\nI will swiftly, speedily bring your repayment on your heads.\n5 Because you have taken my silver and gold,\nAnd you have brought my finest treasures into your temples;\n6 And the people of Judah and Jerusalem you have sold to the Greeks,\nIn order to remove them far from their territory;\n7 Here I am rousing them to come from the place where you sold them,\nAnd I will bring your repayment on your heads.\n8 I will sell your sons and daughters into the hand of the people of Judah,\nAnd they will sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far away;\nFor Jehovah himself has spoken it.\n9 Proclaim this among the nations:\n'Prepare for war!

Jeroboam son of Joash, the king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 2 He said:\n\"Jehovah will roar out of Zion,\nAnd he will raise his voice out of Jerusalem.\nThe pastures of the shepherds will mourn,\nAnd the summit of Carmel will dry up.\"\n3 \"This is what Jehovah says,\n'\"For three revolts of Damascus, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause they threshed Gilead with iron threshing sledges.\n4 So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael,\nAnd it will consume the fortified towers of Ben-hadad.\n5 I will break the bars of Damascus;\nI will destroy the inhabitants from Bikath-aven\nAnd the one ruling from Beth-eden;\nAnd the people of Syria will go as exiles to Kir,\" says Jehovah.'\n6 This is what Jehovah says,\n'\"For three revolts of Gaza, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause they took a whole group of exiles to hand them over to Edom.\n7 So I will send a fire onto the wall of Gaza,\nAnd it will consume her fortified towers.\n8 I will destroy the inhabitants from Ashdod,\nAnd the one ruling from Ashkelon;\nI will turn my hand against Ekron,\nAnd the remaining Philistines will perish,\" says the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.'\n9 This is what Jehovah says,\n'For three revolts of Tyre, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause they handed over a whole group of exiles to Edom,\nAnd because they did not remember the covenant of brothers.\n10 So I will send a fire onto the wall of Tyre,\nAnd it will consume her fortified towers.'\n11 This is what Jehovah says,\n'For three revolts of Edom, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause he pursued his own brother with the sword,\nAnd because he refused to show mercy;\nIn his anger he keeps tearing them apart relentlessly,\nAnd he remains furious with them continually.\n12 So I will send a fire into Teman,\nAnd it will consume the fortified towers of Bozrah.'\n13 This is what Jehovah says,\n'\"For three revolts of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead to widen out their own territory.\n14 So I will set fire to the wall of Rabbah,\nAnd it will consume her fortified towers,\nWith a war cry in the day of battle,\nWith a tempest in the day of storm wind.\n15 And their king will go into exile together with his princes,\" says Jehovah.'\nChapter 2\n1 \"This is what Jehovah says,\n'\"For three revolts of Moab, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause he burned the bones of the king of Edom for lime.\n2 So I will send a fire into Moab,\nAnd it will consume the fortified towers of Kerioth;\nMoab will die amid an uproar,\nWith a war cry, with the sound of a horn.\n3 I will remove the ruler from her midst\nAnd kill all her princes along with him,\" says Jehovah.'\n4 This is what Jehovah says,\n'For three revolts of Judah, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause they rejected the law of Jehovah,\nAnd because they did not keep his regulations;\nBut the same lies their forefathers followed have led them astray.\n5 So I will send a fire into Judah,\nAnd it will consume the fortified towers of Jerusalem.'\n6 This is what Jehovah says,\n'For three revolts of Israel, and for four, I will not reverse it,\nBecause they sell the righteous for silver,\nAnd the poor for a pair of sandals.\n7 They trample the heads of the lowly into the dust of the earth,\nAnd they block the path of the meek.\nA man and his father have relations with the same girl,\nProfaning my holy name.\n8 They stretch out next to every altar on garments they seized as security for a loan;\nAnd the wine they drink at the house of their gods was obtained from those they fined.'\n9 'But it was I who annihilated the Amorite before them,\nWho was as tall as the cedars and as strong as the oaks;\nI destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.\n10 I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,\nAnd I made you walk through the wilderness 40 years,\nTo take possession of the land of the Amorite.\n11 I raised up some of your sons as prophets\nAnd some of your young men as Nazirites.\nIs this not so, O people of Israel?' declares Jehovah.\n12 'But you kept giving the Nazirites wine to drink,\nAnd you commanded the prophets: \"You must not prophesy.\"\n13 So I will crush you in your place,\nJust as a wagon loaded with cut grain crushes what is under it.\n14 The swift one will have no place to flee,\nThe strong one will not retain his power,\nAnd no warrior will escape with his life.\n15 The bowman will not stand his ground,\nThe swift of foot will not escape,\nAnd the horseman will not escape with his life.\n16 Even the most courageous among the warriors\nWill flee naked in that day,' declares Jehovah.\"\nChapter 3\n1 \"Hear this word that Jehovah has spoken concerning you, O people of Israel, concerning the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:\n2 'You alone I have known out of all the families of the earth.\nThat is why I will call you to account for all your errors.\n3 Will two walk together unless they have agreed to meet?\n4 Will a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey?\nWill a young lion growl from its lair when it has caught nothing?\n5 Will a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no snare for it?\nDoes a trap spring up from the ground when it has caught nothing?\n6 If a horn is blown in a city, do the people not tremble?\nIf a calamity occurs in the city, is it not Jehovah who has acted?\n7 For the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will not do a thing\nUnless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.\n8 The lion has roared!

The days are coming upon you when he will lift you up with butcher hooks\nAnd the rest of you with fishhooks.\n3 You will go out through the breaches in the wall, each one straight ahead;\nAnd you will be cast out to Harmon,\" declares Jehovah.'\n4 'Come to Bethel and commit transgression,\nTo Gilgal and transgress even more!\nBring your sacrifices in the morning,\nAnd your tithes on the third day.\n5 Burn a thanksgiving sacrifice of leavened bread;\nLoudly proclaim your voluntary offerings!\nFor that is what you love to do, O people of Israel,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\n6 'And for my part, I made your teeth clean of food in all your cities\nAnd caused a lack of bread in all your houses;\nBut you did not come back to me,' declares Jehovah.\n7 'I also withheld rain from you three months before the harvest;\nI made it rain on one city but not on another city.\nOne plot of land would have rain,\nBut another plot of land where there was no rain would dry up.\n8 People of two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,\nAnd they would not get satisfied;\nBut you did not come back to me,' declares Jehovah.\n9 'I struck you with scorching heat and mildew.\nYou multiplied your gardens and vineyards,\nBut the locust would devour your fig trees and olive trees;\nAnd you still did not come back to me,' declares Jehovah.\n10 'I sent among you a pestilence like that of Egypt.\nWith the sword I killed your young men and captured your horses.\nI made the stench of your camps rise up into your nostrils;\nBut you did not come back to me,' declares Jehovah.\n11 'I caused an overthrow among you\nLike God's overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah.\nAnd you were like a log snatched out of the fire;\nBut you did not come back to me,' declares Jehovah.\n12 So that is what I will do to you, O Israel.\nBecause this is what I will do to you,\nGet ready to meet your God, O Israel.\n13 For look! he is the One who formed the mountains and created the wind;\nHe tells man what His thoughts are,\nHe turns the dawn into darkness,\nAnd he treads on earth's high places;\nJehovah the God of armies is his name.\"\nChapter 5\n1 \"Hear this word that I am taking up against you as a dirge, O house of Israel:\n2 'The virgin, Israel, has fallen;\nShe cannot get up again.\nShe has been abandoned on her own ground;\nThere is no one to raise her up.'\n3 \"For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:\n'The city that marches out with a thousand will have a hundred left;\nAnd the one that goes out with a hundred will have ten left, for the house of Israel.'\n4 \"For this is what Jehovah says to the house of Israel:\n'Search for me and keep living.\n5 Do not search for Bethel,\nDo not go to Gilgal or pass over to Beer-sheba,\nFor Gilgal will certainly go into exile,\nAnd Bethel will come to nothing.\n6 Search for Jehovah, and keep living,\nSo that he does not burst out like a fire on the house of Joseph,\nConsuming Bethel, with no one to extinguish it.\n7 You turn justice into wormwood,\nAnd you cast righteousness to the earth.\n8 The One who made the Kimah constellation and the Kesil constellation,\nThe One who turns deep shadow into morning,\nThe One who makes day as dark as night,\nThe One who summons the waters of the sea\nTo pour them out on the surface of the earth\n-Jehovah is his name.\n9 He will cause destruction to burst out against the strong,\nBringing destruction on fortified places.\n10 They hate those who give reproof in the city gate,\nAnd they detest those who speak truthfully.\n11 Because you demand farm rent from the poor\nAnd you take his grain as tribute,\nYou will not keep dwelling in the houses of hewn stone that you have built\nNor drink the wine from the choice vineyards that you have planted.\n12 For I know how many your revolts are\nAnd how great your sins are\n-You harass the righteous,\nYou take bribes,\nAnd you deny the rights of the poor in the city gate.\n13 Therefore, those with insight will keep silent at that time,\nFor it will be a time of calamity.\n14 Search for what is good, and not what is bad,\nSo that you may keep living.\nThen Jehovah the God of armies may be with you,\nJust as you say he is.\n15 Hate what is bad, and love what is good,\nLet justice prevail in the city gate.\nIt may be that Jehovah the God of armies\nWill show favor to the remaining ones of Joseph.'\n16 \"Therefore this is what Jehovah the God of armies, Jehovah, says:\n'In all the public squares there will be wailing,\nAnd in all the streets they will say, \"Alas, alas!\"\nThey will call on the farmers to mourn\nAnd the professional mourners to wail.'\n17 'In every vineyard there will be wailing;\nFor I will pass through your midst,' says Jehovah.\n18 'Woe to those who yearn for the day of Jehovah!\nWhat, then, will the day of Jehovah mean for you?\nIt will be darkness, and not light.\n19 It will be like a man who flees from a lion and is confronted by a bear,\nAnd when he enters his house and leans his hand against the wall, a snake bites him.\n20 Will not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light;\nWill it not have gloom, and not brightness?\n21 I hate, I despise your festivals,\nAnd I take no pleasure in the aroma of your solemn assemblies.\n22 Even if you offer me whole burnt offerings and gift offerings,\nI will find no pleasure in them;\nAnd I will not look with favor on your communion sacrifices of fattened animals.\n23 Spare me the din of your songs;\nAnd let me not hear the melodies of your stringed instruments.\n24 Let justice flow down like waters,\nAnd righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\n25 Did you bring me sacrifices and gift offerings\nFor those 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?\n26 Now you will have to carry away Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan,\nYour images, the star of your god, whom you made for yourselves,\n27 And I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,' says he whose name is Jehovah the God of armies.\"\nChapter 6\n1 \"Woe to the self-assured ones in Zion,\nTo those feeling secure in the mountain of Samaria,\nThe prominent men of the foremost of nations,\nThose to whom the house of Israel comes!\n2 Cross over to Calneh and see.\nGo from there to Great Hamath,\nAnd go down to Gath of the Philistines.\nAre they better than these kingdoms,\nOr is their territory larger than yours?\n3 Are you putting out of your mind the day of calamity\nAnd bringing in a reign of violence?\n4 They lie on beds of ivory and sprawl out on couches,\nEating the rams of the flock and the fattened calves;\n5 They improvise songs to the sound of the harp,\nAnd like David, they invent musical instruments;\n6 They drink wine by the bowlful\nAnd anoint themselves with the choicest oils.\nBut they are unconcerned about the catastrophe of Joseph.\n7 So they will go into exile at the head of the exiles,\nAnd the revelry of those sprawled out will come to an end.\n8 'The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has sworn by himself,' declares Jehovah the God of armies,\n'\"I detest the pride of Jacob,\nI hate his fortified towers,\nAnd I will hand over the city and what fills it.\n9 \"'\"And if ten men are left in one house, they will also die. 10 A relative will come to carry them out and burn them one by one. He will bring their bones out from the house; then he will say to whoever is in the inner rooms of the house, 'Are there any more with you?' And he will say, 'Nobody!' Then he will say, 'Keep silent! For it is not the time to make any mention of the name of Jehovah.'\"\n11 For it is Jehovah giving the command,\nAnd he will strike down the great house into rubble,\nAnd the small house into debris.\n12 Do horses run on a crag,\nOr will one plow there with cattle?\nFor you have turned justice into a poisonous plant,\nAnd the fruit of righteousness into wormwood.\n13 You rejoice over what is worthless,\nAnd you say, \"Have we not become powerful in our own strength?\"\n14 Therefore, O house of Israel, I will bring against you a nation,' declares Jehovah the God of armies,\n'And they will oppress you from Lebo-hamath down to the Wadi of the Arabah.'\"\nChapter 7\n1 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! He formed a locust swarm when the late crop was beginning to come up. This was the later crop after the king's hay had been cut. 2 When the swarm finished eating up the vegetation of the land, I said: \"O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, please forgive! How can Jacob survive? For he is weak!\"\n3 So Jehovah reconsidered this. \"It will not happen,\" Jehovah said.\n4 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah called for a punishment by fire. It consumed the vast deep waters, and it consumed a portion of the land. 5 Then I said: \"O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, please hold this back. How can Jacob survive? For he is weak!\"\n6 So Jehovah reconsidered this. \"That too will not happen,\" the Sovereign Lord Jehovah said.\n7 This is what he showed me: Look! Jehovah was standing on a wall made with a plumb line, and there was a plumb line in his hand. 8 Then Jehovah said to me: \"What do you see, Amos?\" So I said: \"A plumb line.\" Jehovah then said: \"Here I am putting a plumb line among my people Israel. I will no longer pardon them. 9 The high places of Isaac will be desolated, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be devastated; and I will come against the house of Jeroboam with a sword.\"\n10 Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: \"Amos is conspiring against you right in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot put up with all his words. 11 For this is what Amos says, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile from its land.'\"\n12 Amaziah then said to Amos: \"O visionary, go, run away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and there you may prophesy. 13 But you must no longer prophesy at Bethel, for it is the sanctuary of a king and the house of a kingdom.\"\n14 Then Amos answered Amaziah: \"I was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdsman, and I took care of sycamore fig trees. 15 But Jehovah took me away from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.' 16 So now hear the word of Jehovah: 'You are saying, \"Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Isaac.\" 17 Therefore this is what Jehovah says: \"Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be apportioned out with a measuring line, and you yourself will die in an unclean land; and Israel will surely go into exile from its land.\"'\"\nChapter 8\n1 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! There was a basket of summer fruit. 2 Then he said, \"What do you see, Amos?\" I replied, \"A basket of summer fruit.\" Then Jehovah said to me: \"The end has come for my people Israel. I will no longer pardon them. 3 'The songs of the temple will turn into wailing in that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 'There will be many carcasses thrown everywhere-hush!'\n4 Hear this, you who trample on the poor\nAnd who bring the meek of the land to an end,\n5 Who say, 'When will the new moon festival be over, that we may sell our grain,\nAnd the Sabbath, that we may offer grain for sale?\nSo that we may make the ephah measure smaller\nAnd the shekel weight greater,\nTo falsify our scales of deception;\n6 So that we may buy the needy for silver\nAnd the poor for a pair of sandals,\nAnd sell the worthless part of the grain.'\n7 Jehovah has sworn by the Pride of Jacob,\n'Never will I forget all their deeds.\n8 On this account the land will tremble,\nAnd every inhabitant in it will mourn.\nWill it not all rise like the Nile,\nAnd surge and sink down like the Nile of Egypt?'\n9 'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,\n'I will make the sun go down at high noon,\nAnd I will darken the land on a bright day.\n10 I will turn your festivals into mourning\nAnd all your songs into dirges.\nI will put sackcloth on all hips and make every head bald;\nI will make it like the mourning for an only son,\nAnd the end of it like a bitter day.'\n11 'Look! The days are coming,' declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,\n'When I will send a famine into the land,\nNot a famine for bread or a thirst for water,\nBut for hearing the words of Jehovah.\n12 They will stagger from sea to sea\nAnd from the north to the east.\nThey will rove about searching for the word of Jehovah, but they will not find it.\n13 In that day beautiful virgins will faint,\nAlso young men, because of the thirst;\n14 Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and who say,\n\"As surely as your god lives, O Dan!\"\nAnd, \"As surely as the way of Beer-sheba lives!\"\nThey will fall, and they will not rise up again.'\"\nChapter 9\n1 I saw Jehovah stationed above the altar, and he said: \"Strike the head of the pillar, and the thresholds will shake. Cut them off at the head, and I will kill the last of them with the sword. No one who flees will get away, and no one trying to escape will succeed.\n2 If they dig down into the Grave,\nFrom there my hand will take them;\nAnd if they go up to the heavens,\nFrom there I will bring them down.\n3 And if they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,\nFrom there I will search them out and take them.\nIf they conceal themselves from my eyes on the bottom of the sea,\nThere I will command the serpent to bite them.\n4 If they go into captivity before their enemies,\nFrom there I will command the sword, and it will kill them;\nI will fix my eyes on them for bad, and not for good.\n5 For the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of the armies, is the One who touches the land,\nSo that it melts, and all its inhabitants will mourn;\nAnd all of it will rise like the Nile,\nAnd sink down like the Nile of Egypt.\n6 'The one who builds his stairs in the heavens\nAnd establishes his structure over the earth;\nThe one who summons the waters of the sea,\nTo pour them out on the surface of the earth\n-Jehovah is his name.'\n7 'Are you not like the sons of the Cushites to me, O people of Israel?' declares Jehovah.\n'Did I not bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt,\nThe Philistines out of Crete, and Syria out of Kir?'\n8 'Look!

    "text": "Zechariah\nChapter 1\n1 In the eighth month in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo, saying: 2 \"Jehovah grew greatly indignant at your fathers.\n3 \"Say to them, 'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"'Return to me,' declares Jehovah of armies, 'and I will return to you,' says Jehovah of armies.\"'\n4 \"'Do not become like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed: \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Turn away, please, from your evil ways and your evil deeds.'\"'\n\"'But they did not listen, and they paid no attention to me,' declares Jehovah.\n5 \"'Where are your fathers now? And did the prophets live forever? 6 However, my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants, the prophets, caught up with your fathers, did they not?' So they returned to me and said: 'Jehovah of armies has dealt with us according to our ways and our deeds, just as he had determined to do.'\"\n7 On the 24th day of the 11th month, that is, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo, saying: 8 \"I saw a vision in the night. There was a man riding on a red horse, and he stood still among the myrtle trees in the ravine; and behind him there were red, reddish-brown, and white horses.\"\n9 So I said: \"Who are these, my lord?\"\nThe angel who was speaking with me replied: \"I will show you who these are.\"\n10 Then the man who was standing still among the myrtle trees said: \"These are the ones whom Jehovah has sent out to walk about in the earth.\" 11 And they said to the angel of Jehovah who was standing among the myrtle trees: \"We have walked about in the earth, and look! the whole earth is quiet and undisturbed.\"\n12 So the angel of Jehovah said: \"O Jehovah of armies, how long will you withhold your mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with whom you have been indignant these 70 years?\"\n13 Jehovah answered the angel who was speaking with me, with kind and comforting words. 14 Then the angel who was speaking with me told me: \"Call out, 'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"I am zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great zeal. 15 With great indignation I am indignant with the nations that are at ease, because I felt indignant to a small extent, but they added to the calamity.\"'\n16 \"Therefore this is what Jehovah says: '\"I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and my own house will be built in her,\" declares Jehovah of armies, \"and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.\"'\n17 \"Call out once more and say, 'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"My cities will again overflow with goodness; and Jehovah will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\"'\"\n18 Then I looked up and saw four horns. 19 So I asked the angel who was speaking with me: \"What are these?\" He replied: \"These are the horns that dispersed Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.\"\n20 Jehovah then showed me four craftsmen. 21 I asked: \"What are these coming to do?\"\nHe said: \"These are the horns that dispersed Judah to such an extent that no one was able to raise his head. These others will come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations that lifted up their horns against the land of Judah, in order to disperse her.\"\nChapter 2\n1 And I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 2 So I asked: \"Where are you going?\"\nHe replied: \"To measure Jerusalem, to see what is her width and what is her length.\"\n3 And look! the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came to meet him. 4 Then he said to him: \"Run over there and tell that young man, '\"Jerusalem will be inhabited as open rural country, because of all the men and livestock within her. 5 And I will become to her,\" declares Jehovah, \"a wall of fire all around, and I will become the glory in her midst.\"'\"\n6 \"Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,\" declares Jehovah.\n\"For I have scattered you to the four winds of the heavens,\" declares Jehovah.\n7 \"Come, Zion! Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon. 8 For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after being glorified has sent me to the nations that were plundering you: 'Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye. 9 For now I will wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own slaves.' And you will certainly know that Jehovah of armies has sent me.\n10 \"Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion; for I am coming, and I will reside in your midst,\" declares Jehovah. 11 \"Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and they will become my people; and I will reside in your midst.\" And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. 12 Jehovah will take possession of Judah as his portion on the holy ground, and he will again choose Jerusalem. 13 Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah, for he is taking action from his holy dwelling.\nChapter 3\n1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan was standing at his right hand to resist him. 2 Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan: \"May Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan, yes, may Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire?\"\n3 Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and standing before the angel. 4 The angel said to those standing before him, \"Remove his filthy garments.\" Then he said to him, \"See, I have caused your error to pass away from you, and you will be clothed with fine garments.\"\n5 So I said: \"Let a clean turban be put on his head.\" And they put the clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing nearby. 6 The angel of Jehovah then declared to Joshua: 7 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'If you will walk in my ways and carry out your responsibilities before me, then you will serve as a judge in my house and take care of my courtyards; and I will give you free access among these who are standing here.'\n8 \"'Hear, please, O High Priest Joshua, you and your companions who sit before you, for these men serve as a sign; look! I am bringing in my servant Sprout! 9 See the stone that I have set before Joshua! On the one stone are seven eyes; and I am engraving an inscription on it,' declares Jehovah of armies, 'and I will take away the guilt of that land in one day.'\n10 \"'In that day,' declares Jehovah of armies, 'each of you will invite your neighbor to come under your vine and under your fig tree.'\"\nChapter 4\n1 The angel who had been speaking with me came back and woke me up, as when waking someone from sleep. 2 Then he said to me: \"What do you see?\"\nSo I said: \"I see, and look! a lampstand entirely of gold, with a bowl on top of it. There are seven lamps on it, yes, seven, and the lamps, which are at the top of it, have seven pipes. 3 And next to it are two olive trees, one on the right of the bowl and one on the left.\"\n4 Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me: \"What do these things mean, my lord?\" 5 So the angel who was speaking with me asked: \"Do you not know what these things mean?\"\nI replied: \"No, my lord.\"\n6 He then said to me: \"This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel: '\"Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit,\" says Jehovah of armies. 7 Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a level land. And he will bring out the top stone amid shouts of: \"How wonderful! How wonderful!\"'\"\n8 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 9 \"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his own hands will finish it. And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. 10 For who has despised the day of small beginnings? For they will rejoice and see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah, which are roving about in all the earth.\"\n11 Then I asked him: \"What is the meaning of these two olive trees on the right and on the left of the lampstand?\" 12 I asked him a second time: \"What is the meaning of the two bunches of twigs of the olive trees that are pouring out the golden liquid through the two golden tubes?\"\n13 So he asked me: \"Do you not know what these things mean?\"\nI replied: \"No, my lord.\"\n14 He said: \"These are the two anointed ones who are standing alongside the Lord of the whole earth.\"\nChapter 5\n1 Again I looked up, and I saw a flying scroll. 2 He asked me: \"What do you see?\"\nI replied: \"I see a flying scroll, which is 20 cubits long and 10 cubits wide.\"\n3 Then he said to me: \"This is the curse that is going out over the face of all the earth, because everyone who steals, as written on its one side, has gone unpunished; and everyone who makes a sworn oath, as written on its other side, has gone unpunished. 4 'I have sent it out,' declares Jehovah of armies, 'and it will enter into the house of the thief and into the house of the one who makes a false oath in my name; and it will remain inside that house and consume it and its timbers and its stones.'\"\n5 Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said to me: \"Look up, please, and see what is going out.\"\n6 So I asked: \"What is it?\"\nHe replied: \"This is the ephah container that is going out.\" He continued: \"This is their appearance in all the earth.\" 7 And I saw that the round lid of lead was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the container. 8 So he said: \"This is Wickedness.\" Then he threw her back into the ephah container, after which he thrust the lead weight over its mouth.\n9 Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward, and they were soaring in the wind. They had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the container between the earth and heaven. 10 So I asked the angel who was speaking with me: \"Where are they taking the ephah container?\"\n11 He replied: \"To the land of Shinar to build her a house; and when it is prepared, she will be deposited there in her proper place.\"\nChapter 6\n1 Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the mountains were of copper. 2 The first chariot had red horses, and the second chariot, black horses. 3 The third chariot had white horses, and the fourth chariot, speckled and dappled horses.\n4 I asked the angel who was speaking with me: \"What are these, my lord?\"\n5 The angel answered me: \"These are the four spirits of the heavens that are going out after having taken their station before the Lord of the whole earth. 6 The one with the black horses is going out to the land of the north; the white ones are going out beyond the sea; and the speckled ones are going out to the land of the south. 7 And the dappled ones were eager to go out to walk about through the earth.\" Then he said: \"Go, walk about through the earth.\" And they began walking about through the earth.\n8 He then called out to me and said: \"See, those going out to the land of the north have caused the spirit of Jehovah to rest in the land of the north.\"\n9 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 10 \"Take from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah what they brought from the people in exile; and on that day, you must go to the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah along with these who have come from Babylon. 11 You should take silver and gold and make a crown and put it on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 12 And say to him,\n\"'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"Here is the man whose name is Sprout. He will sprout from his own place, and he will build the temple of Jehovah. 13 He is the one who will build the temple of Jehovah, and he is the one who will assume the majesty. He will sit down on his throne and rule, and he will also be a priest on his throne, and there will be a peaceable agreement between the two. 14 And the crown will serve as a memorial for Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah, in the temple of Jehovah. 15 And those who are far away will come and take part in building the temple of Jehovah.\" And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. And it will occur-if you do not fail to listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.'\"\nChapter 7\n1 And in the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, that is, the month of Chislev. 2 The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and his men to beg for the favor of Jehovah, 3 saying to the priests of the house of Jehovah of armies and to the prophets: \"Should I weep in the fifth month and abstain from food, as I have done for so many years?\"\n4 The word of Jehovah of armies again came to me, saying: 5 \"Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and wailed in the fifth month and in the seventh month for 70 years, did you really fast for me? 6 And when you would eat and drink, were you not eating for yourselves and drinking for yourselves? 7 Should you not obey the words that Jehovah proclaimed through the former prophets, while Jerusalem and her surrounding cities were inhabited and at peace, and while the Negeb and the Shephelah were inhabited?'\"\n8 The word of Jehovah again came to Zechariah, saying: 9 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Judge with true justice, and deal with one another in loyal love and mercy. 10 Do not defraud the widow or the fatherless child, the foreigner or the poor; and do not scheme evil against one another in your hearts.' 11 But they kept refusing to pay attention, and they stubbornly turned their backs, and they stopped up their ears so as not to hear. 12 They made their heart like a diamond and would not obey the law and the words that Jehovah of armies sent by his spirit through the former prophets. So there came great indignation from Jehovah of armies.\"\n13 \"'Just as they did not listen when I called, so I would not listen when they called,' says Jehovah of armies. 14 'And I scattered them with a storm wind throughout all the nations that they had not known, and the land was left desolate behind them, with no one passing through or returning; for they turned the desirable land into an object of horror.'\"\nChapter 8\n1 The word of Jehovah of armies again came, saying: 2 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'I will be zealous for Zion with a great zeal, and with great wrath I will be zealous for her.'\"\n3 \"This is what Jehovah says, 'I will return to Zion and reside in Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called the city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of armies, the holy mountain.'\"\n4 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Old men and women will again sit in the public squares of Jerusalem, each with his staff in his hand because of his great age. 5 And the public squares of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing there.'\"\n6 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Although it may seem too difficult to the remaining ones of this people in those days, should it seem too difficult also to me?' declares Jehovah of armies.\"\n7 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Here I am saving my people from the lands of the east and the west. 8 And I will bring them in, and they will reside in Jerusalem; and they will become my people, and I will become their God in truth and in righteousness.'\"\n9 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words from the mouth of the prophets, the same words that were spoken on the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah of armies was laid for the temple to be built. 10 For before that time, there were no wages being paid either for man or for beast; and it was not safe to come and go because of the adversary, for I turned all men one against another.'\n11 \"'But now I will not deal with the remaining ones of this people as in the former days,' declares Jehovah of armies. 12 'For the seed of peace will be sown; the vine will produce its fruit and the earth its yield, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remaining ones of this people to inherit all these things. 13 And just as you became an object of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will become a blessing. Do not be afraid! Let your hands be strong.'\n14 \"For this is what Jehovah of armies says, '\"Just as I had determined to bring calamity on you because your forefathers made me indignant,\" says Jehovah of armies, \"and I felt no regret, 15 so at this time I have determined to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid!\"'\n16 \"'These are the things you should do: Speak the truth with one another, and the judgments in your gates must promote truth and peace. 17 Do not scheme calamity against one another in your hearts, and do not love any false oath; for these are all things that I hate,' declares Jehovah.\"\n18 The word of Jehovah of armies again came to me, saying: 19 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth month, the fast of the seventh month, and the fast of the tenth month will be occasions for exultation and joy for the house of Judah-festivals of rejoicing. So love truth and peace.'\n20 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'It will yet come to pass that peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will come; 21 and the inhabitants of one city will go to those of another and say: \"Let us earnestly go to beg for the favor of Jehovah and to seek Jehovah of armies. I am also going.\" 22 And many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem and to beg for the favor of Jehovah.'\n23 \"This is what Jehovah of armies says, 'In those days ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold, yes, they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew, saying: \"We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you people.\"'\"\nChapter 9\n1 A pronouncement:\n\"The word of Jehovah is against the land of Hadrach,\nAnd Damascus is its target\n-For Jehovah's eye is on mankind\nAnd on all the tribes of Israel-\n2 And against Hamath, which borders on her,\nAnd against Tyre and Sidon, for they are so wise.\n3 Tyre built herself a rampart.\nShe piled up silver like dust\nAnd gold like the dirt of the streets.\n4 Look! Jehovah will take away her possessions,\nAnd he will strike down her army into the sea;\nAnd she will be consumed in the fire.\n5 Ashkelon will see it and be afraid;\nGaza will feel great anguish,\nAlso Ekron, because her hope is put to shame.\nA king will perish from Gaza,\nAnd Ashkelon will not be inhabited.\n6 An illegitimate son will settle in Ashdod,\nAnd I will do away with the pride of the Philistine.\n7 I will remove the bloodstained things from his mouth\nAnd the disgusting things from between his teeth,\nAnd he will be left remaining for our God;\nAnd he will become like a sheikh in Judah,\nAnd Ekron like the Jebusite.\n8 I will encamp as a guard for my house,\nSo that there will be no one passing through and no one returning;\nAnd no taskmaster will pass through again,\nFor now I have seen it with my eyes.\n9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.\nShout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem.\nLook!

The wailing of shepherds,\nFor their majesty has been devastated.\nListen! The roaring of young lions,\nFor the dense thickets along the Jordan have been destroyed.\n4 \"This is what Jehovah my God says, 'Shepherd the flock meant for the slaughter, 5 whose buyers slaughter them and are not held guilty. And those who sell them say, \"May Jehovah be praised, for I will become rich.\" And their shepherds have no compassion for them.'\n6 \"'For I will no longer show compassion on the inhabitants of the land,' declares Jehovah. 'So I will cause each man to fall into the hand of his neighbor and his king; and they will crush the land, and I will not rescue them out of their hand.'\"\n7 And I began to shepherd the flock meant for slaughter, in your behalf, O afflicted ones of the flock. So I took two staffs, and I called one Pleasantness, and the other Union, and I began to shepherd the flock. 8 And I dismissed three shepherds in one month, for I became impatient with them, and they detested me as well. 9 And I said: \"I will not keep shepherding you. Let the one who is dying die, and let the one perishing perish. As for those who are left, let them devour one another's flesh.\" 10 So I took my staff Pleasantness and cut it up, breaking my covenant that I had made with all the peoples. 11 So it was broken in that day, and the afflicted ones of the flock who were watching me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.\n12 Then I said to them: \"If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, withhold them.\" And they paid my wages, 30 pieces of silver.\n13 Then Jehovah said to me: \"Throw it into the treasury-the magnificent value with which they valued me.\" So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury at the house of Jehovah.\n14 Then I cut up my second staff, the Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\n15 And Jehovah said to me: \"Now take the equipment of a useless shepherd. 16 For I am letting a shepherd rise up in the land. He will not take care of the sheep that are perishing; he will not seek out the young or heal the injured or feed those able to stand. Instead, he devours the flesh of the fat one and tears off the hooves of the sheep.\n17 Woe to my worthless shepherd, who is abandoning the flock!\nA sword will strike his arm and his right eye.\nHis arm will wither completely,\nAnd his right eye will go completely blind.\"\nChapter 12\n1 A pronouncement:\n\"The word of Jehovah concerning Israel,\" declares Jehovah,\nThe One who stretched out the heavens,\nWho laid the foundation of the earth,\nAnd who formed the spirit of man within him.\n2 \"Here I am making Jerusalem a cup that causes all the surrounding peoples to stagger; and there will be a siege against Judah as well as against Jerusalem. 3 In that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone to all the peoples. All those who lift it are sure to be severely injured; and all the nations of the earth will be gathered against her. 4 In that day,\" declares Jehovah, \"I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. I will keep my eyes on the house of Judah, but I will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. 5 And the sheikhs of Judah will say in their heart, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to me by means of Jehovah of armies their God.' 6 In that day I will make the sheikhs of Judah like a fiery pot among wood and like a fiery torch in a row of cut grain, and they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left; and Jerusalem will again be inhabited in her place, in Jerusalem.\n7 \"And Jehovah will save the tents of Judah first, so that the beauty of the house of David and the beauty of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be too great over Judah. 8 In that day Jehovah will be a defense around the inhabitants of Jerusalem; in that day the one who stumbles among them will be like David, and the house of David like God, like Jehovah's angel who goes before them. 9 And in that day I will be certain to annihilate all the nations that come against Jerusalem.\n10 \"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of favor and supplication, and they will look to the one whom they pierced, and they will wail over him as they would wail over an only son; and they will grieve bitterly over him as they would grieve over a firstborn son. 11 In that day the wailing in Jerusalem will be great, like the wailing at Hadadrimmon in the Plain of Megiddo. 12 And the land will wail, each family by itself; the family of David's house by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of Nathan's house by itself, and their women by themselves; 13 the family of Levi's house by itself, and their women by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their women by themselves; 14 and all the families that are left remaining, each family by itself, and their women by themselves.\nChapter 13\n1 \"In that day a well will be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for cleansing sin and impurity.\n2 \"In that day,\" declares Jehovah of armies, \"I will erase the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will rid the land of the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness. 3 And if a man should prophesy again, his father and his mother who caused his birth will say to him, 'You will not live, because you have spoken lies in the name of Jehovah.' And his father and his mother who caused his birth will pierce him through because of his prophesying.\n4 \"In that day each of the prophets will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; and they will not wear an official garment of hair in order to deceive. 5 And he will say, 'I am no prophet. I am a man cultivating the soil, because a man bought me when I was young.' 6 And if someone asks him, 'What are these wounds between your shoulders?' he will answer, 'Wounds I received in the house of my friends.'\"\n7 \"O sword, awake against my shepherd,\nAgainst the man who is my companion,\" declares Jehovah of armies.\n\"Strike the shepherd, and let the flock be scattered;\nAnd I will turn my hand against those who are insignificant.\"\n8 \"And in all the land,\" declares Jehovah,\n\"Two parts in it will be cut off and perish;\nAnd the third part will be left remaining in it.\n9 And I will bring the third part through the fire;\nAnd I will refine them as silver is refined,\nAnd test them as gold is tested.\nThey will call on my name,\nAnd I will answer them.\nI will say, 'They are my people,'\nAnd they will say, 'Jehovah is our God.'\"\nChapter 14\n1 \"Look! The day is coming, a day belonging to Jehovah, when the spoil from you will be divided in your midst. 2 I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for the war; and the city will be captured and the houses plundered and the women raped. And half of the city will go into exile, but the remaining ones of the people will not be cut off from the city.\n3 \"Jehovah will go out and war against those nations as when he fights in the day of a battle. 4 In that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in half, from east to west, forming a very great valley; and half of the mountain will move to the north, and half of it to the south. 5 You will flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains will extend all the way to Azel. You will have to flee, just as you fled because of the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. And Jehovah my God will come, and all the holy ones will be with him.\n6 \"In that day there will be no precious light-things will be congealed. 7 And it will become one day that is known as belonging to Jehovah. It will not be day, nor will it be night; and at evening time there will be light. 8 In that day living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea. It will happen in summer and in winter. 9 And Jehovah will be King over all the earth. In that day Jehovah will be one, and his name one.\n10 \"The whole land will become like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will rise and be inhabited in her place, from the Gate of Benjamin all the way to the site of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the winepresses of the king. 11 And people will inhabit her; and there will never again be a curse of destruction, and Jerusalem will be inhabited in security.\n12 \"And this is the scourge with which Jehovah will scourge all the peoples who wage war against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot away while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongues will rot away in their mouths.\n13 \"In that day confusion from Jehovah will be widespread among them; and each one will grab hold of the hand of his companion, and his hand will come against the hand of his companion. 14 Judah will also be involved in the war at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in vast quantity.\n15 \"And a scourge like that scourge will also come against the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and all the livestock that are in those camps.\n16 \"Everyone who is left remaining out of all the nations that come against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to bow down to the King, Jehovah of armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Booths. 17 But if anyone among the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to bow down to the King, Jehovah of armies, no rain will fall on them. 18 And if the family of Egypt does not come up and does not come in, they will have no rain. Instead, they will have the scourge with which Jehovah scourges the nations that do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Booths. 19 This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the sin of all the nations that do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Booths.\n20 \"In that day the words 'Holiness belongs to Jehovah!' will be written on the bells of the horses. And the cooking pots in the house of Jehovah will be like the bowls before the altar. 21 And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy and will belong to Jehovah of armies, and all those who are sacrificing will come in and use some of them for boiling. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of armies.\" \n",

So if I am a father, where is the honor due me? And if I am a master, where is the fear due me?' Jehovah of armies says to you priests who are despising my name.\n\"'But you say: \"How have we despised your name?\"'\n7 \"'By presenting polluted food on my altar.'\n\"'And you say: \"How have we polluted you?\"'\n\"'By saying: \"The table of Jehovah is something to be despised.\" 8 And when you present a blind animal as a sacrifice, you say: \"It is nothing bad.\" And when you present a lame animal or a sick one: \"It is nothing bad.\"'\"\n\"Try presenting them, please, to your governor. Will he be pleased with you or receive you with favor?\" says Jehovah of armies.\n9 \"And now, please, appeal to God, that he may show us favor. With such offerings from your own hand, will he receive any of you with favor?\" says Jehovah of armies.\n10 \"And who among you is willing to shut the doors? For you will not even light my altar without charge. I find no delight in you,\" says Jehovah of armies, \"and I take no pleasure in any gift offering from your hand.\"\n11 \"For from the rising of the sun to its setting, my name will be great among the nations. In every place sacrifices will be made to smoke, and offerings will be made to my name, as a pure gift; because my name will be great among the nations,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n12 \"But you are profaning it by saying, 'The table of Jehovah is polluted, and its fruit, its food, is to be despised.' 13 You also say, 'Look! How tiresome!' and you sniff scornfully at it,\" says Jehovah of armies. \"And you bring stolen, lame, and sick animals. Yes, you bring such things as a gift! Should I accept it from your hand?\" says Jehovah.\n14 \"Cursed is the cunning one who has a sound male animal in his flock, but he makes a vow and sacrifices a blemished one to Jehovah. For I am a great King,\" says Jehovah of armies, \"and my name will be awe-inspiring among the nations.\"\nChapter 2\n1 \"And now, O priests, this commandment is for you. 2 If you refuse to listen and to take it to heart to glorify my name,\" says Jehovah of armies, \"I will send on you the curse, and I will turn your blessings into curses. Yes, I have turned the blessings into curses, because you are not taking it to heart.\"\n3 \"Look! I will ruin your sown seed because of you, and I will scatter dung on your faces, the dung of your festivals; and you will be carried away to it. 4 Then you will know that I have given this commandment to you so that my covenant with Levi may continue,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n5 \"My covenant with him was one of life and of peace, which I gave to him, along with fear. He feared me, yes, he stood in awe of my name. 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and no unrighteousness was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and in uprightness, and he turned many back from error. 7 For the lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth, because he is the messenger of Jehovah of armies.\n8 \"But you yourselves have turned aside from the way. You have made many stumble with regard to the law. You have ruined the covenant of Levi,\" says Jehovah of armies. 9 \"So I will make you despised and low before all the people, because you did not keep my ways but showed partiality in applying the law.\"\n10 \"Do we not all have one father? Was it not one God who created us? So why do we deal treacherously with one another, profaning the covenant of our forefathers? 11 Judah has dealt treacherously, and something detestable has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, which He loves, and he has taken as a bride the daughter of a foreign god. 12 Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob anyone who does this, whoever he may be, though he presents a gift offering to Jehovah of armies.\"\n13 \"And there is another thing that you do, which results in covering the altar of Jehovah with tears and with weeping and sighing, so that he no longer pays attention to your gift offering or looks favorably on anything from your hand. 14 And you say, 'For what reason?' It is because Jehovah has acted as a witness between you and the wife of your youth, with whom you have dealt treacherously, although she is your partner and your wife by covenant. 15 But there was one who did not do it, for he had what remained of the spirit. And what was that one seeking? The offspring of God. So guard yourselves respecting your spirit, and do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth. 16 For I hate divorce,\" says Jehovah the God of Israel, \"and the one who covers his garment with violence,\" says Jehovah of armies. \"And guard yourselves respecting your spirit, and you must not deal treacherously.\n17 \"You have made Jehovah weary with your words. But you say, 'How have we made him weary?' By saying, 'Everyone who does bad is good in the eyes of Jehovah, and he finds pleasure in him,' or by saying, 'Where is the God of justice?'\"\nChapter 3\n1 \"Look! I am sending my messenger, and he will clear up a way before me. And suddenly the true Lord, whom you are seeking, will come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant will come, in whom you take delight. Look! He will certainly come,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n2 \"But who will endure the day of his coming, and who will be able to stand when he appears? For he will be like the fire of a refiner and like the lye of laundrymen. 3 And he will sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver and will cleanse the sons of Levi; and he will clarify them like gold and like silver, and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering in righteousness. 4 And the gift offering of Judah and of Jerusalem will actually be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of long ago and as in the years of antiquity.\n5 \"I will come near to you for judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who take false oaths, against those who defraud the hired worker, the widow, and the fatherless child, and against those who refuse to help the foreigner. These have not feared me,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n6 \"For I am Jehovah; I do not change. And you are sons of Jacob; you have not yet come to your finish. 7 From the days of your forefathers you have turned aside from my regulations and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,\" says Jehovah of armies.\nBut you say: \"How are we supposed to return?\"\n8 \"Will a mere human rob God? But you are robbing me.\"\nAnd you say: \"How have we robbed you?\"\n\"In the tithes and in the contributions. 9 You are certainly cursed, for you are robbing me-yes, the entire nation is doing so. 10 Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my house; and test me out, please, in this regard,\" Jehovah of armies says, \"to see whether I will not open to you the floodgates of the heavens and pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.\"\n11 \"And I will rebuke the devouring one for you, and it will not ruin the fruit of your land, nor will the vine in your field be fruitless,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n12 \"All the nations will have to declare you happy, for you will become a land of delight,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n13 \"Your words against me have been strong,\" says Jehovah.\nAnd you say: \"How have we spoken against you among ourselves?\"\n14 \"You say, 'It is of no value to serve God. How have we benefited by keeping our obligations to him and by walking somberly before Jehovah of armies? 15 Now we consider presumptuous people happy. Also, those who practice wickedness are successful. They dare to put God to the test and get away with it.'\"\n16 At that time those who fear Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening. And a book of remembrance was written before him for those fearing Jehovah and for those meditating on his name.\n17 \"And they will be mine,\" says Jehovah of armies, \"in the day when I produce a special property. I will show them compassion, just as a man shows compassion to his son who serves him. 18 And you will again see the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person, between one serving God and one not serving him.\"\nChapter 4\n1 \"For look! the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the presumptuous ones and all those practicing wickedness will become like stubble. The coming day will certainly devour them,\" says Jehovah of armies, \"and it will leave them neither root nor branch. 2 But on you who honor my name, the sun of righteousness will shine, with healing in its rays; and you will skip about like fattened calves.\"\n3 \"And you will tread the wicked underfoot, for they will be like dust under the soles of your feet on the day when I take action,\" says Jehovah of armies.\n4 \"Remember the Law of my servant Moses, the regulations and judgments that I commanded at Horeb for all Israel to obey.\n5 \"Look! I am sending to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awe-inspiring day of Jehovah. 6 And he will turn the hearts of fathers back toward sons, and the hearts of sons back toward fathers, so that I may not come and strike the earth, devoting it to destruction.\"\n(End of the translation of the Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures, to be followed by that of the Christian Greek Scriptures) \n",

    "text": "Mark\nChapter 1\n1 The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God: 2 Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: \"(Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.) 3 A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight.'\" 4 John the Baptizer was in the wilderness, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins. 5 And all the territory of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins. 6 Now John wore clothing of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. 7 And he was preaching: \"Someone stronger than I am is coming after me, the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 8 I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with holy spirit.\"\n9 In the course of those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. 10 And immediately on coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being parted and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him. 11 And a voice came out of the heavens: \"You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.\"\n12 And immediately the spirit impelled him to go into the wilderness. 13 So he continued in the wilderness for 40 days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild beasts, but the angels were ministering to him.\n14 Now after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the good news of God 15 and saying: \"The appointed time has been fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent, and have faith in the good news.\"\n16 While walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Simon's brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishermen. 17 So Jesus said to them: \"Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.\" 18 And at once they abandoned their nets and followed him. 19 After going a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, while they were in their boat mending their nets, 20 and without delay he called them. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after him. 21 And they went into Capernaum.\nAs soon as the Sabbath began, he went into the synagogue and started to teach. 22 And they were astounded at his way of teaching, for he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. 23 Just then there was a man in their synagogue who was under the power of an unclean spirit, and he shouted: 24 \"What have we to do with you, Jesus the Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know exactly who you are, the Holy One of God!\" 25 But Jesus rebuked it, saying: \"Be silent, and come out of him!\" 26 And the unclean spirit, after throwing the man into a convulsion and yelling at the top of its voice, came out of him. 27 Well, the people were all so astonished that they began to discuss it among themselves, saying: \"What is this? A new teaching! He authoritatively orders even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.\" 28 So the report about him spread quickly in all directions throughout the entire region of Galilee.\n29 At that they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew with James and John. 30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying down sick with a fever, and they at once told him about her. 31 Going to her, he took her by the hand and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began ministering to them.\n32 After evening had fallen, when the sun had set, the people began bringing to him all who were ill and demon possessed; 33 and the whole city was gathered right at the door. 34 So he cured many who were ill with various sicknesses, and he expelled many demons, but he would not let the demons speak, for they knew him to be Christ.\n35 Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up and went outside and left for an isolated place, and there he began praying. 36 However, Simon and those with him hunted him down 37 and found him, and they said to him: \"Everyone is looking for you.\" 38 But he said to them: \"Let us go somewhere else, into the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also, for this is why I have come.\" 39 And he went, preaching in their synagogues throughout the whole of Galilee and expelling the demons.\n40 There also came to him a leper, pleading with him even on bended knee, saying to him: \"If you just want to, you can make me clean.\" 41 At that he was moved with pity, and he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him: \"I want to! Be made clean.\" 42 Immediately the leprosy vanished from him, and he became clean. 43 Then he gave him strict orders and at once sent him away, 44 saying to him: \"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things Moses directed, for a witness to them.\" 45 But after going away, the man started to proclaim it a great deal and to spread the account widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into a city, but he stayed outside in isolated places. Yet they kept coming to him from all sides.\nChapter 2\n1 However, after some days he again entered into Capernaum, and the word spread that he was at home. 2 And so many gathered that there was no more room, not even around the door, and he began to speak the word to them. 3 And they brought him a paralytic carried by four men. 4 But they could not bring him right to Jesus because of the crowd, so they removed the roof above Jesus, and after digging an opening, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic: \"Child, your sins are forgiven.\" 6 Now some of the scribes were there, sitting and reasoning in their hearts: 7 \"Why is this man talking this way? He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?\" 8 But immediately Jesus discerned by his spirit that they were reasoning that way among themselves, so he said to them: \"Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts? 9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk'? 10 But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth-\" he said to the paralytic: 11 \"I say to you, Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.\" 12 At that he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of them all. So they were all astonished, and they glorified God, saying: \"We have never seen anything like this.\"\n13 Again he went out alongside the sea, and all the crowd kept coming to him, and he began to teach them. 14 And as he was passing by, he caught sight of Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: \"Be my follower.\" At that he rose up and followed him. 15 Later he was dining in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many of them who were following him. 16 But when the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they began saying to his disciples: \"Does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" 17 On hearing this, Jesus said to them: \"Those who are strong do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.\"\n18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees practiced fasting. So they came and said to him: \"Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees practice fasting, but your disciples do not practice fasting?\" 19 So Jesus said to them: \"While the bridegroom is with them, the friends of the bridegroom have no reason to fast, do they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 20 But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day. 21 Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment. If he does, the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear becomes worse. 22 Also, no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. But new wine is put into new wineskins.\"\n23 Now as he was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, his disciples started to pluck the heads of grain as they went. 24 So the Pharisees said to him: \"Look here! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\" 25 But he said to them: \"Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and the men with him were hungry? 26 How, in the account about Abiathar the chief priest, he entered into the house of God and ate the loaves of presentation, which it is not lawful for anybody to eat except the priests, and he also gave some to the men who were with him?\" 27 Then he said to them: \"The Sabbath came into existence for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath. 28 So the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\"\nChapter 3\n1 Once again he entered into a synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. 2 So they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him. 3 He said to the man with the withered hand: \"Get up and come to the center.\" 4 Next he said to them: \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?\" But they kept silent. 5 After looking around at them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts, he said to the man: \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 6 At that the Pharisees went out and immediately began holding council with the party followers of Herod against him, in order to kill him.\n7 But Jesus departed for the sea along with his disciples, and a great multitude from Galilee and from Judea followed him. 8 Even from Jerusalem and from Idumea and from across the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude came to him when they heard about the many things he was doing. 9 And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that the crowd would not press in on him. 10 Because he cured many, all those who had serious diseases were crowding around him to touch him. 11 Even the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before him and cry out and say: \"You are the Son of God.\" 12 But many times he sternly ordered them not to make him known.\n13 He ascended a mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him. 14 And he formed a group of 12, whom he also named apostles, those who were to accompany him and whom he would send out to preach 15 and to have authority to expel demons.\n16 And the group of 12 that he formed were Simon, to whom he also gave the name Peter, 17 James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (he also gave these the name Boanerges, which means \"Sons of Thunder\"), 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananaean, 19 and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.\nThen he went into a house, 20 and again the crowd gathered, so that they were not able even to eat a meal. 21 But when his relatives heard about it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying: \"He has gone out of his mind.\" 22 Also, the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying: \"He has Beelzebub, and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons.\" 23 So after calling them to him, he spoke to them with illustrations: \"How can Satan expel Satan? 24 If a kingdom becomes divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand; 25 and if a house becomes divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 26 Also, if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he cannot stand but is coming to an end. 27 In fact, no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house. 28 Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men, no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak. 29 But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin.\" 30 He said this because they were saying: \"He has an unclean spirit.\"\n31 Now his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. 32 As there was a crowd sitting around him, they said to him: \"Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.\" 33 But he replied to them: \"Who are my mother and my brothers?\" 34 Then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said: \"See, my mother and my brothers! 35 Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.\"\nChapter 4\n1 Again he began teaching beside the sea, and a very large crowd gathered near him. So he went aboard a boat and sat in it away from the shore, but the whole crowd was next to the sea, along the shore. 2 And he began to teach them many things with illustrations, and while he was teaching, he said to them: 3 \"Listen. Look! The sower went out to sow. 4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up. 5 Others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil, and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep. 6 But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7 Other seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them, and they yielded no fruit. 8 But others fell on the fine soil, and growing up and increasing, they began to yield fruit, and they were bearing 30, 60, and 100 times more.\" 9 Then he added: \"Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.\"\n10 Now when he was alone, those around him with the Twelve began questioning him about the illustrations. 11 He said to them: \"To you the sacred secret of the Kingdom of God has been given, but to those outside all things are in illustrations, 12 so that, though looking, they may look and still not see, and though hearing, they may hear and still not get the sense of it; nor will they ever turn back and receive forgiveness.\" 13 Further, he said to them: \"You do not know this illustration, so how will you understand all the other illustrations?\n14 \"The sower sows the word. 15 These, then, are the ones alongside the road where the word is sown; but as soon as they have heard it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 16 Likewise, these are the ones sown on rocky ground; as soon as they have heard the word, they accept it with joy. 17 Yet they have no root in themselves, but they continue for a time; then as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, they are stumbled. 18 There are still others that are sown among the thorns. These are the ones who have heard the word, 19 but the anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches and the desires for everything else make inroads and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 20 Finally, the ones that were sown on the fine soil are those who listen to the word and favorably receive it and bear fruit-30, 60, and 100 times more.\"\n21 He also said to them: \"A lamp is not brought out to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not brought out to be put on a lampstand? 22 For there is nothing hidden that will not be exposed; nothing is carefully concealed that will not come out in the open. 23 Whoever has ears to listen, let him listen.\"\n24 He further said to them: \"Pay attention to what you are hearing. With the measure that you are measuring out, you will have it measured out to you, yes, you will have more added to you. 25 For whoever has will have more given to him, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.\"\n26 So he went on to say: \"In this way the Kingdom of God is just as when a man casts seeds on the ground. 27 He sleeps at night and rises up by day, and the seeds sprout and grow tall-just how, he does not know. 28 On its own the ground bears fruit gradually, first the stalk, then the head, finally the full grain in the head. 29 But as soon as the crop permits it, he thrusts in the sickle, because the harvesttime has come.\"\n30 And he went on to say: \"With what can we compare the Kingdom of God, or with what illustration can we explain it? 31 It is like a mustard grain, which at the time it was sown in the ground was the tiniest of all the seeds on the earth. 32 But when it has been sown, it grows and becomes greater than all other vegetable plants and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to find lodging under its shadow.\"\n33 With many illustrations of that sort he spoke the word to them, to the extent that they were able to listen. 34 Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them, but he would explain all things privately to his disciples.\n35 And on that day, when evening had fallen, he said to them: \"Let us cross to the other shore.\" 36 So after they had dismissed the crowd, they took him in the boat, just as he was, and there were other boats with him. 37 Now a great violent windstorm broke out, and the waves kept crashing into the boat, so that the boat was close to being swamped. 38 But he was in the stern, sleeping on the pillow. So they woke him up and said to him: \"Teacher, do you not care that we are about to perish?\" 39 With that he got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea: \"Hush! Be quiet!\" And the wind abated, and a great calm set in. 40 So he said to them: \"Why are you so afraid? Do you not yet have any faith?\" 41 But they felt an unusual fear, and they said to one another: \"Who really is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him.\"\nChapter 5\n1 Then they came to the other side of the sea into the region of the Gerasenes. 2 And immediately after Jesus got out of the boat, a man under the power of an unclean spirit met him from among the tombs. 3 His haunt was among the tombs, and up to that time, absolutely no one was able to bind him securely, even with a chain. 4 He had often been bound with fetters and chains, but he snapped the chains apart and smashed the fetters; and nobody had the strength to subdue him. 5 And continually, night and day, he was crying out in the tombs and in the mountains and slashing himself with stones. 6 But on catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down to him. 7 Then he cried out with a loud voice: \"What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I put you under oath by God not to torment me.\" 8 For Jesus had been saying to it: \"Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.\" 9 But Jesus asked him: \"What is your name?\" And he replied: \"My name is Legion, because there are many of us.\" 10 And he kept pleading with Jesus not to send the spirits out of the country.\n11 Now a great herd of swine was feeding there at the mountain. 12 So the spirits pleaded with him: \"Send us into the swine, so that we may enter into them.\" 13 And he gave them permission. With that the unclean spirits came out and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice into the sea, about 2,000 of them, and were drowned in the sea. 14 But their herders fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside, and people came to see what had happened. 15 So they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who previously had the legion, sitting clothed and in his right mind, and they grew fearful. 16 Also, those who had seen it related to them how this had happened to the demon-possessed man and the swine. 17 So they began to plead with Jesus to go away from their region.\n18 Now as he was boarding the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed pleaded to go with him. 19 However, he did not let him but said to him: \"Go home to your relatives, and report to them all the things Jehovah has done for you and the mercy he has shown you.\" 20 This man went away and started to proclaim in the Decapolis all the things Jesus had done for him, and all the people were amazed.\n21 After Jesus had crossed again by boat to the opposite shore, a large crowd gathered together to him, and he was by the sea. 22 One of the presiding officers of the synagogue, named Jairus, now came, and on catching sight of him, he fell at his feet. 23 He pleaded with him many times, saying: \"My little daughter is extremely ill. Please come and put your hands on her so that she may get well and live.\" 24 At that Jesus went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing against him.\n25 Now there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for 12 years. 26 She had suffered much at the hands of many physicians and had spent all her resources, and she was no better but, rather, had become worse. 27 When she heard the reports about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer garment, 28 for she kept saying: \"If I touch just his outer garments, I will get well.\" 29 And immediately her flow of blood dried up, and she sensed in her body that she had been healed of the grievous sickness.\n30 Immediately Jesus realized in himself that power had gone out of him, and he turned around in the crowd and asked: \"Who touched my outer garments?\" 31 But his disciples said to him: \"You see the crowd pressing in on you, and you ask, 'Who touched me?'\" 32 However, he was looking around to see who had done this. 33 The woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. 34 He said to her: \"Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed from your grievous sickness.\"\n35 While he was yet speaking, some men from the home of the presiding officer of the synagogue came and said: \"Your daughter died! Why bother the Teacher any longer?\" 36 But Jesus overheard their words and said to the presiding officer of the synagogue: \"Have no fear, only exercise faith.\" 37 Now he did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.\n38 So they came to the house of the presiding officer of the synagogue, and he saw the commotion and those weeping and wailing loudly. 39 After stepping in, he said to them: \"Why are you weeping and causing this commotion? The child has not died but is sleeping.\" 40 At this they began to laugh at him scornfully. But after sending them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those with him, and he went in where the child was. 41 Then, taking the hand of the child, he said to her: \"Talitha cumi,\" which, when translated, means: \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\" 42 And immediately the girl rose and began walking. (She was 12 years old.) And at once they were beside themselves with great ecstasy. 43 But he ordered them again and again to let no one learn of this, and he said that something should be given her to eat.\nChapter 6\n1 He departed from there and came into his home territory, and his disciples followed him. 2 When it was the Sabbath, he started teaching in the synagogue, and most who heard him were astounded and said: \"Where did this man get these things? And why should this wisdom have been given to him, and such powerful works be performed through his hands? 3 This is the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, is it not? And his sisters are here with us, are they not?\" So they began to stumble because of him. 4 But Jesus said to them: \"A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and among his relatives and in his own house.\" 5 So he was not able to do any powerful work there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them. 6 Indeed, he was amazed at their lack of faith. And he went around in a circuit to the villages, teaching.\n7 He now summoned the Twelve and started sending them out two by two, and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 8 Also, he gave them orders to carry nothing for the trip except a staff-no bread, no food pouch, no money in their belts- 9 but to put on sandals and not to wear two garments. 10 Further, he said to them: \"Wherever you enter into a home, stay there until you leave that place. 11 And wherever a place will not receive you or listen to you, on going out from there, shake off the dirt that is on your feet for a witness to them.\" 12 Then they set out and preached that people should repent, 13 and they expelled many demons and greased many sick people with oil and cured them.\n14 Now King Herod heard of this, for the name of Jesus became well-known, and people were saying: \"John the Baptizer has been raised up from the dead, and that is why the powerful works are operating in him.\" 15 But others were saying: \"It is Elijah.\" Still others were saying: \"It is a prophet like one of the prophets of old.\" 16 But when Herod heard it, he said: \"The John whom I beheaded, this one has been raised up.\" 17 For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her. 18 For John had been saying to Herod: \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" 19 So Herodias was nursing a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not. 20 For Herod was in fear of John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and he was keeping him safe. After hearing him, he was at a great loss as to what to do, yet he continued to hear him gladly.\n21 But a convenient day arrived when Herod spread an evening meal on his birthday for his high officials and the military commanders and the most prominent men of Galilee. 22 And the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those dining with him. The king said to the girl: \"Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.\" 23 Yes, he swore to her: \"Whatever you ask me for, I will give it to you, up to half my kingdom.\" 24 So she went out and said to her mother: \"What should I ask for?\" She said: \"The head of John the Baptizer.\" 25 She immediately rushed in to the king and made her request, saying: \"I want you to give me right away on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\" 26 Although this deeply grieved him, the king did not want to disregard her request, because of his oaths and his guests. 27 So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John's head. So he went off and beheaded him in the prison 28 and brought his head on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 29 When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n30 The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all the things they had done and taught. 31 And he said to them: \"Come, you yourselves, privately into an isolated place and rest up a little.\" For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure time even to eat a meal. 32 So they set off in the boat for an isolated place to be by themselves. 33 But people saw them going and many got to know it, and from all the cities they ran together on foot and got there ahead of them. 34 Well, on getting out, he saw a large crowd, and he was moved with pity for them, because they were as sheep without a shepherd. And he started to teach them many things.\n35 By now the hour had grown late, and his disciples came up to him and said: \"This place is isolated, and the hour is already late. 36 Send them away, so that they may go off into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" 37 He replied to them: \"You give them something to eat.\" At this they said to him: \"Should we go off and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to the people to eat?\" 38 He said to them: \"How many loaves do you have? Go see!\" After finding out, they said: \"Five, besides two fish.\" 39 And he instructed all the people to recline in groups on the green grass. 40 So they reclined in groups of 100 and of 50. 41 Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves up and began giving them to the disciples to place them before the people, and he divided up the two fish for all. 42 So they all ate and were satisfied, 43 and they took up 12 baskets full of fragments, aside from the fish. 44 Those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men.\n45 Then, without delay, he made his disciples board the boat and go on ahead to the opposite shore toward Bethsaida, while he himself sent the crowd away. 46 But after saying good-bye to them, he went to a mountain to pray. 47 When evening had fallen, the boat was in the middle of the sea, but he was alone on the land. 48 So when he saw them struggling to row, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he came toward them, walking on the sea; but he was inclined to pass them by. 49 On catching sight of him walking on the sea, they thought: \"It is an apparition!\" And they cried out. 50 For they all saw him and were troubled. But immediately he spoke to them and said: \"Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.\" 51 Then he got up into the boat with them, and the wind abated. At this they were utterly amazed, 52 for they had not grasped the meaning of the loaves, but their hearts continued dull in understanding.\n53 When they got across to land, they came to Gennesaret and anchored the boat nearby. 54 But as soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized him. 55 They ran around all that region and started to bring on stretchers those who were ailing to where they heard he was. 56 And wherever he would enter into villages or cities or the countryside, they would place the sick ones in the marketplaces, and they would plead with him that they might touch just the fringe of his outer garment. And all those who touched it were made well.\nChapter 7\n1 Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him. 2 And they saw some of his disciples eat their meal with defiled hands, that is, unwashed ones. 3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow, clinging to the tradition of the men of former times, 4 and when they come from the market, they do not eat unless they wash themselves. There are many other traditions that they have received and cling to, such as baptisms of cups, pitchers, and copper vessels.) 5 So these Pharisees and scribes asked him: \"Why do your disciples not observe the tradition of the men of former times, but they eat their meal with defiled hands?\" 6 He said to them: \"Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. 7 It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.' 8 You let go of the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men.\"\n9 Further, he said to them: \"You skillfully disregard the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition. 10 For example, Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Let the one who speaks abusively of his father or mother be put to death.' 11 But you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother: \"Whatever I have that could benefit you is corban (that is, a gift dedicated to God),\"' 12 you no longer let him do a single thing for his father or his mother. 13 Thus you make the word of God invalid by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this.\" 14 So calling the crowd to him again, he said to them: \"Listen to me, all of you, and understand the meaning. 15 Nothing from outside a man that enters into him can defile him; but the things that come out of a man are the things that defile him.\" 16 --\n17 Now when he had entered a house away from the crowd, his disciples began to question him about the illustration. 18 So he said to them: \"Are you also without understanding like them? Are you not aware that nothing from outside that enters into a man can defile him, 19 since it enters, not into his heart, but into his stomach, and it passes out into the sewer?\" Thus he declared all foods clean. 20 Further, he said: \"That which comes out of a man is what defiles him. 21 For from inside, out of the heart of men, come injurious reasonings: sexual immorality, thefts, murders, 22 acts of adultery, greed, acts of wickedness, deceit, brazen conduct, an envious eye, blasphemy, haughtiness, and unreasonableness. 23 All these wicked things come from within and defile a man.\"\n24 He rose up from there and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon. There he entered into a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape notice. 25 Immediately, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell down at his feet. 26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nationality; and she kept asking him to expel the demon from her daughter. 27 But he said to her: \"First let the children be satisfied, for it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.\" 28 But she replied to him: \"Yes, sir, and yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat of the crumbs of the little children.\" 29 At that he said to her: \"Because you said this, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.\" 30 So she went away to her home and found the young child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.\n31 When Jesus returned from the region of Tyre, he went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of Decapolis. 32 Here they brought him a deaf man with a speech impediment, and they pleaded with him to lay his hand on him. 33 And he took him aside privately, away from the crowd. Then he put his fingers into the man's ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue. 34 And looking up into heaven, he sighed deeply and said to him: \"Ephphatha,\" that is, \"Be opened.\" 35 At this his ears were opened, and his speech impediment was removed, and he began speaking normally. 36 With that he ordered them not to tell anyone, but the more he would order them, the more they would proclaim it. 37 Indeed, they were astounded beyond measure, and they said: \"He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the speechless speak.\"\nChapter 8\n1 In those days, there was again a large crowd, and they had nothing to eat. So he summoned the disciples and said to them: 2 \"I feel pity for the crowd, because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. 3 If I send them off to their homes hungry, they will give out on the road, and some of them are from far away.\" 4 But his disciples answered him: \"From where will anyone get enough bread in this isolated place to satisfy these people?\" 5 At this he asked them: \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said: \"Seven.\" 6 And he instructed the crowd to recline on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them, and began giving them to his disciples to serve, and they served them to the crowd. 7 They also had a few small fish, and blessing these, he told them to serve these also. 8 So they ate and were satisfied, and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments. 9 Now there were about 4,000 men. Then he sent them away.\n10 Immediately he boarded the boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha. 11 Here the Pharisees came and started disputing with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven, to put him to the test. 12 So he sighed deeply in his spirit and said: \"Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say, no sign will be given to this generation.\" 13 With that he left them, got aboard again, and went to the opposite shore.\n14 However, they forgot to take bread along, and they had nothing with them in the boat except for one loaf. 15 And he warned them in no uncertain terms: \"Keep your eyes open; look out for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\" 16 So they began arguing with one another over the fact that they had no bread. 17 Noting this, he said to them: \"Why do you argue over your having no bread? Do you not yet perceive and understand? Are your hearts still dull in understanding? 18 'Though having eyes, do you not see; and though having ears, do you not hear?' Do you not remember 19 when I broke the five loaves for the 5,000 men, how many baskets full of fragments you collected?\" They said to him: \"Twelve.\" 20 \"When I broke the seven loaves for the 4,000 men, how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up?\" And they said to him: \"Seven.\" 21 With that he said to them: \"Do you not yet understand?\"\n22 Now they put in at Bethsaida. Here people brought him a blind man, and they pleaded with him to touch him. 23 And he took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside the village. After spitting on his eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked him: \"Do you see anything?\" 24 The man looked up and said: \"I see people, but they look like trees walking about.\" 25 Again he laid his hands on the man's eyes, and the man saw clearly. His sight was restored, and he could see everything distinctly. 26 So he sent him home, saying: \"Do not enter into the village.\"\n27 Jesus and his disciples now left for the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he began to question his disciples, saying: \"Who are people saying that I am?\" 28 They said to him: \"John the Baptist, but others say Elijah, and still others, one of the prophets.\" 29 And he put the question to them: \"You, though, who do you say I am?\" Peter answered him: \"You are the Christ.\" 30 At that he strictly ordered them not to tell anyone about him. 31 Also, he began teaching them that the Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and rise three days later. 32 Indeed, he was making that statement openly. But Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 33 At this he turned, looked at his disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying: \"Get behind me, Satan! because you think, not God's thoughts, but those of men.\"\n34 He now called the crowd to him with his disciples and said to them: \"If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me. 35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the sake of the good news will save it. 36 Really, what good will it do a man to gain the whole world and to lose his life? 37 What, really, would a man give in exchange for his life? 38 For whoever becomes ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\"\nChapter 9\n1 Furthermore, he said to them: \"Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God already having come in power.\" 2 Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them; 3 his outer garments began to glisten, becoming far whiter than any clothes cleaner on earth could whiten them. 4 Also, Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were conversing with Jesus. 5 Then Peter said to Jesus: \"Rabbi, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" 6 In fact, he did not know how to react, for they were quite fearful. 7 And a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: \"This is my Son, the beloved. Listen to him.\" 8 Then suddenly they looked around and saw that no one was with them any longer except Jesus.\n9 As they were coming down from the mountain, he strictly ordered them not to relate to anybody what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead. 10 They took the word to heart, but discussed among themselves what this rising from the dead meant. 11 And they began to question him, saying: \"Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?\" 12 He said to them: \"Elijah does come first and restore all things; but how is it that it is written about the Son of man that he must undergo many sufferings and be treated with contempt? 13 But I say to you that Elijah, in fact, has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.\"\n14 When they came to the other disciples, they noticed a large crowd around them, and there were scribes arguing with them. 15 But as soon as all the crowd caught sight of him, they were astonished, and they ran up to him to greet him. 16 So he asked them: \"What are you arguing about with them?\" 17 And one of the crowd answered him: \"Teacher, I brought my son to you because he has a speechless spirit. 18 Wherever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and loses his strength. I asked your disciples to expel it, but they were not able to do so.\" 19 In response he said to them: \"O faithless generation, how long must I continue with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.\" 20 So they brought the boy to him, but at the sight of him, the spirit at once threw the child into convulsions. After falling on the ground, he kept rolling about, foaming at the mouth. 21 Then Jesus asked the father: \"How long has this been happening to him?\" He said: \"From childhood on, 22 and often it would throw him into the fire and also into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.\" 23 Jesus said to him: \"That expression, 'If you can'! Why, all things are possible for the one who has faith.\" 24 Immediately the child's father cried out and said: \"I have faith! Help me out where I need faith!\"\n25 Jesus, now noticing that a crowd was rushing toward them, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it: \"You speechless and deaf spirit, I order you, get out of him and do not enter into him again!\" 26 After crying out and going through many convulsions, it came out, and the child seemed to be dead, so that most of the people were saying: \"He is dead!\" 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up, and he stood up. 28 So after he entered into a house, his disciples asked him privately: \"Why could we not expel it?\" 29 He said to them: \"This kind can come out only by prayer.\"\n30 They departed from there and went through Galilee, but he did not want anyone to get to know about it. 31 For he was teaching his disciples and telling them: \"The Son of man is going to be betrayed into men's hands, and they will kill him, but despite being killed, he will rise three days later.\" 32 However, they did not understand his statement, and they were afraid to question him.\n33 And they came into Capernaum. Now when he was inside the house, he put the question to them: \"What were you arguing about on the road?\" 34 They kept silent, for on the road they had been arguing among themselves about who is greater. 35 So he sat down and called the Twelve and said to them: \"If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and minister of all.\" 36 Then he took a young child and stood him in their midst; and putting his arms around him, he said to them: 37 \"Whoever receives one of such young children on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me receives not me only but also Him who sent me.\"\n38 John said to him: \"Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he was not following us.\" 39 But Jesus said: \"Do not try to prevent him, for there is no one who will do a powerful work on the basis of my name who will quickly be able to say anything bad about me. 40 For whoever is not against us is for us. 41 And whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, I tell you truly, he will by no means lose his reward. 42 But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith, it would be better for him if a millstone that is turned by a donkey were put around his neck and he were pitched into the sea.\n43 \"If ever your hand makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to go off with two hands into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out. 44 -- 45 And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to be thrown with two feet into Gehenna. 46 -- 47 And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away. It is better for you to enter one-eyed into the Kingdom of God than to be thrown with two eyes into Gehenna, 48 where the maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.\n49 \"For everyone must be salted with fire. 50 Salt is fine, but if the salt ever loses its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace with one another.\"\nChapter 10\n1 From there he got up and came to the borders of Judea across the Jordan, and again crowds gathered to him. As he was accustomed to do, he again began teaching them. 2 And Pharisees approached, intent on testing him, and they asked whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife. 3 He answered them: \"What did Moses command you?\" 4 They said: \"Moses allowed the writing of a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her.\" 5 But Jesus said to them: \"Out of regard for your hard-heartedness, he wrote this commandment for you. 6 However, from the beginning of creation, 'He made them male and female. 7 For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother, 8 and the two will be one flesh,' so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. 9 Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.\" 10 When they were again in the house, the disciples began to question him about this. 11 He said to them: \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, 12 and if ever a woman after divorcing her husband marries another, she commits adultery.\"\n13 People now began bringing him young children for him to touch them, but the disciples reprimanded them. 14 At seeing this, Jesus was indignant and said to them: \"Let the young children come to me; do not try to stop them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones. 15 Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it.\" 16 And he took the children into his arms and began blessing them, laying his hands on them.\n17 As he was going on his way, a man ran up and fell on his knees before him and put the question to him: \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit everlasting life?\" 18 Jesus said to him: \"Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except one, God. 19 You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother.'\" 20 The man said to him: \"Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth on.\" 21 Jesus looked at him and felt love for him and said, \"One thing is missing about you: Go, sell what things you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.\" 22 But he grew sad at the answer and went away grieved, for he had many possessions.\n23 After looking around, Jesus said to his disciples: \"How difficult it will be for those with money to enter into the Kingdom of God!\" 24 But the disciples were surprised at his words. Jesus then responded: \"Children, how difficult it is to enter into the Kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.\" 26 They became still more astounded and said to him: \"Who possibly can be saved?\" 27 Looking straight at them, Jesus said: \"With men it is impossible but not so with God, for all things are possible with God.\" 28 Peter began to say to him: \"Look! We have left all things and followed you.\" 29 Jesus said: \"Truly I say to you, no one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news 30 who will not get 100 times more now in this period of time-houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, with persecutions-and in the coming system of things, everlasting life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\"\n32 Now they were going on the road up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were astonished, but those who followed began to fear. Once again he took the Twelve aside and started to tell them these things that were about to happen to him: 33 \"Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations, 34 and these will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him, but three days later he will rise.\"\n35 James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached him and said to him: \"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.\" 36 He said to them: \"What do you want me to do for you?\" 37 They replied: \"Grant us to sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\" 38 But Jesus said to them: \"You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup that I am drinking or be baptized with the baptism with which I am being baptized?\" 39 They said to him: \"We can.\" At that Jesus said to them: \"The cup I am drinking, you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am being baptized, you will be baptized. 40 However, to sit down at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared.\"\n41 When the ten others heard about it, they became indignant at James and John. 42 But Jesus called them to him and said to them: \"You know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them. 43 This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister, 44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all. 45 For even the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.\"\n46 They then came into Jericho. But as he and his disciples and a considerable crowd were going out of Jericho, Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting beside the road. 47 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he started shouting and saying: \"Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!\" 48 At this many began rebuking him, telling him to be silent, but all the more he kept shouting: \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" 49 So Jesus stopped and said: \"Call him to me.\" So they called the blind man, saying to him: \"Take courage! Get up; he is calling you.\" 50 Throwing off his outer garment, he leaped to his feet and went to Jesus. 51 Then Jesus said to him: \"What do you want me to do for you?\" The blind man said to him: \"Rabboni, let me recover my sight.\" 52 And Jesus said to him: \"Go. Your faith has made you well.\" And immediately he recovered his sight, and he began to follow him on the road.\nChapter 11\n1 Now when they were getting near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples 2 and told them: \"Go into the village that is within sight, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied on which no man has sat until now. Untie it and bring it here. 3 And if anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here right away.'\" 4 So they went away and found the colt tied at a door, outside on the side street, and they untied it. 5 But some of those standing there said to them: \"What are you doing untying the colt?\" 6 They told them just what Jesus had said, and they let them go.\n7 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they put their outer garments on it, and he sat on it. 8 Also, many spread their outer garments on the road, but others cut down foliage from the fields. 9 And those going in front and those coming behind kept shouting: \"Save, we pray! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name! 10 Blessed is the coming Kingdom of our father David! Save, we pray, in the heights above!\" 11 And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple, and he looked around at everything, but since the hour was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.\n12 The next day when they were leaving Bethany, he felt hungry. 13 From a distance he caught sight of a fig tree that had leaves, and he went to see whether he could find something on it. But on coming to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. 14 So he said to it: \"Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.\" And his disciples were listening.\n15 They now came to Jerusalem. There he entered the temple and started to throw out those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, 16 and he would not let anyone carry a utensil through the temple. 17 He was teaching and saying to them: \"Is it not written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a cave of robbers.\" 18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and they began to seek how to kill him; for they were in fear of him, because all the crowd was astounded at his teaching.\n19 When it became late in the day, they went out of the city. 20 But when they were passing by early in the morning, they saw the fig tree already withered from its roots. 21 Peter, remembering it, said to him: \"Rabbi, see! the fig tree that you cursed has withered.\" 22 In reply Jesus said to them: \"Have faith in God. 23 Truly I say to you that whoever tells this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says is going to happen, he will have it happen. 24 This is why I tell you, all the things you pray and ask for, have faith that you have received them, and you will have them. 25 And when you stand praying, forgive whatever you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your trespasses.\" 26 --\n27 They came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came 28 and said to him: \"By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?\" 29 Jesus said to them: \"I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 30 Was the baptism by John from heaven or from men? Answer me.\" 31 So they began to reason among themselves, saying: \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why, then, did you not believe him?' 32 But dare we say, 'From men'?\" They were in fear of the crowd, for these all held that John had really been a prophet. 33 So they answered Jesus: \"We do not know.\" Jesus said to them: \"Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.\"\nChapter 12\n1 Then he started to speak to them with illustrations: \"A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a vat for the winepress and erected a tower; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad. 2 In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators to collect some of the fruits of the vineyard from them. 3 But they took him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. 4 Again he sent another slave to them, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored. 5 And he sent another, and that one they killed, and many others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed. 6 One more he had, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 7 But those cultivators said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' 8 So they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. 9 What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill the cultivators and will give the vineyard to others. 10 Did you never read this scripture: 'The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone. 11 This has come from Jehovah, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\"\n12 At that they wanted to seize him, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that he spoke the illustration with them in mind. So they left him and went away.\n13 Next they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the party followers of Herod in order to catch him in his speech. 14 On arriving, these said to him: \"Teacher, we know you are truthful and you do not seek anyone's favor, for you do not look at the outward appearance of people, but you teach the way of God in line with truth. Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not? 15 Should we pay, or should we not pay?\" Detecting their hypocrisy, he said to them: \"Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a denarius to look at.\" 16 They brought one, and he said to them: \"Whose image and inscription is this?\" They said to him: \"Caesar's.\" 17 Jesus then said: \"Pay back Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.\" And they were amazed at him.\n18 Now the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him: 19 \"Teacher, Moses wrote us that if someone's brother dies and leaves a wife behind but does not leave a child, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother. 20 There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, but when he died he left no offspring. 21 And the second married her but died without leaving offspring, and the third the same way. 22 And all seven left no offspring. Last of all, the woman also died. 23 In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.\" 24 Jesus said to them: \"Is not this why you are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? 25 For when they rise from the dead, neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in the heavens. 26 But concerning the dead being raised up, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account about the thornbush, that God said to him: 'I am the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob'? 27 He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken.\"\n28 One of the scribes who had come up and heard them disputing, knowing that he had answered them in a fine way, asked him: \"Which commandment is first of all?\" 29 Jesus answered: \"The first is, 'Hear, O Israel, Jehovah our God is one Jehovah, 30 and you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.' 31 The second is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.\" 32 The scribe said to him: \"Teacher, you spoke well, in line with truth, 'He is One, and there is no other besides him'; 33 and to love him with one's whole heart, with one's whole understanding, and with one's whole strength and to love one's neighbor as oneself is worth far more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" 34 At this Jesus, discerning that he had answered intelligently, said to him: \"You are not far from the Kingdom of God.\" But no one had the courage to question him anymore.\n35 However, as Jesus continued teaching in the temple, he said: \"How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is David's son? 36 By the holy spirit, David himself said, 'Jehovah said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.\"' 37 David himself calls him Lord, so how can it be that he is his son?\"\nAnd the large crowd was listening to him with pleasure. 38 And in his teaching he went on to say: \"Beware of the scribes who want to walk around in robes and want greetings in the marketplaces 39 and front seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals. 40 They devour the houses of the widows, and for show they make long prayers. These will receive a more severe judgment.\"\n41 And he sat down with the treasury chests in view and began observing how the crowd was dropping money into the treasury chests, and many rich people were dropping in many coins. 42 Now a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins of very little value. 43 So he called his disciples to him and said to them: \"Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests. 44 For they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, put in everything she had, all she had to live on.\"\nChapter 13\n1 As he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him: \"Teacher, see! what wonderful stones and buildings!\" 2 However, Jesus said to him: \"Do you see these great buildings? By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.\"\n3 As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives with the temple in view, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately: 4 \"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are to come to a conclusion?\" 5 So Jesus began to tell them: \"Look out that nobody misleads you. 6 Many will come on the basis of my name, saying, 'I am he,' and will mislead many. 7 Moreover, when you hear of wars and reports of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must take place, but the end is not yet.\n8 \"For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in one place after another; there will also be food shortages. These are a beginning of pangs of distress.\n9 \"As for you, look out for yourselves. People will hand you over to local courts, and you will be beaten in synagogues and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them. 10 Also, in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first. 11 And when they are taking you to hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what to say; but whatever is given you in that hour, say this, for you are not the ones speaking, but the holy spirit is. 12 Furthermore, brother will deliver brother over to death, and a father a child, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. 13 And you will be hated by all people on account of my name. But the one who has endured to the end will be saved.\n14 \"However, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader use discernment), then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains. 15 Let the man on the housetop not come down nor go inside to take anything out of his house; 16 and let the man in the field not return to the things behind to pick up his outer garment. 17 Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days! 18 Keep praying that it may not occur in wintertime; 19 for those days will be days of a tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation that God created until that time, and will not occur again. 20 In fact, unless Jehovah had cut short the days, no flesh would be saved. But on account of the chosen ones whom he has chosen, he has cut short the days.\n21 \"Then, too, if anyone says to you, 'See! Here is the Christ,' or, 'See! There he is,' do not believe it. 22 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones. 23 You, then, watch out. I have told you all things beforehand.\n24 \"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, 25 and the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 26 And then they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 27 And then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth's extremity to heaven's extremity.\n28 \"Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near. 29 Likewise also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near at the doors. 30 Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen. 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.\n32 \"Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father. 33 Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is. 34 It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch. 35 Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day or at midnight or before dawn or early in the morning, 36 in order that when he comes suddenly, he does not find you sleeping. 37 But what I say to you, I say to all: Keep on the watch.\"\nChapter 14\n1 Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread was two days later. And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to seize him by cunning and kill him; 2 for they were saying: \"Not at the festival; perhaps there might be an uproar of the people.\"\n3 And while he was at Bethany dining in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very expensive. She broke open the alabaster jar and began pouring it on his head. 4 At this some said to one another indignantly: \"Why has this perfumed oil been wasted? 5 For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than 300 denarii and the money given to the poor!\" And they were greatly annoyed with her. 6 But Jesus said: \"Let her alone. Why do you try to make trouble for her? She did a fine deed toward me. 7 For you always have the poor with you, and you can do them good whenever you want to, but you will not always have me. 8 She did what she could; she poured perfumed oil on my body beforehand, in view of the burial. 9 Truly I say to you, wherever the good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did will also be told in memory of her.\"\n10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went off to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. 11 When they heard it, they were delighted and promised to give him silver money. So he began seeking an opportunity to betray him.\n12 Now on the first day of the Unleavened Bread, when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice, his disciples said to him: \"Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" 13 With that he sent two of his disciples and said to them: \"Go into the city, and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him, 14 and wherever he goes inside, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says: \"Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\"' 15 And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Prepare it for us there.\" 16 So the disciples went out, and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them, and they prepared for the Passover.\n17 After evening had fallen, he came with the Twelve. 18 And as they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said: \"Truly I say to you, one of you who is eating with me will betray me.\" 19 They began to be grieved and to say to him one by one: \"It is not I, is it?\" 20 He said to them: \"It is one of the Twelve, the one dipping with me into the bowl. 21 For the Son of man is going away, just as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\"\n22 And as they continued eating, he took a loaf, said a blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: \"Take it; this means my body.\" 23 And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, and they all drank out of it. 24 And he said to them: \"This means my 'blood of the covenant,' which is to be poured out in behalf of many. 25 Truly I say to you, I will by no means drink anymore of the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.\" 26 Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n27 And Jesus said to them: \"You will all be stumbled, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered about.' 28 But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" 29 But Peter said to him: \"Even if all the others are stumbled, I will not be.\" 30 At that Jesus said to him: \"Truly I say to you that today, yes, on this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.\" 31 But he kept insisting: \"If I have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.\" Also, all the others began to say the same thing.\n32 So they came to a spot named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples: \"Sit down here while I pray.\" 33 And he took Peter and James and John along with him, and he began to feel deeply distressed and to be greatly troubled. 34 He said to them: \"I am deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch.\" 35 And going a little way forward, he fell to the ground and began praying that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. 36 And he said: \"Abba, Father, all things are possible for you; remove this cup from me. Yet, not what I want, but what you want.\" 37 He returned and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: \"Simon, are you sleeping? Did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour? 38 Keep on the watch and pray continually, so that you do not come into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.\" 39 And he went away again and prayed, saying the same thing. 40 And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, so they did not know what to answer him. 41 And he returned the third time and said to them: \"At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting! It is enough! The hour has come! Look! The Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42 Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.\"\n43 And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 44 Now his betrayer had given them an agreed sign, saying: \"Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one; take him into custody, and lead him away under guard.\" 45 And he came straight up and approached him and said, \"Rabbi!\" and gave him a tender kiss. 46 So they seized him and took him into custody. 47 However, one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear. 48 But in response Jesus said to them: \"Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber? 49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and yet you did not take me into custody. Nevertheless, this is to fulfill the Scriptures.\"\n50 And they all abandoned him and fled. 51 However, a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby, and they tried to seize him, 52 but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked.\n53 They now led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes assembled. 54 But Peter, from a good distance, followed him as far as into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting together with the house attendants and warming himself before a bright fire. 55 Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they were not finding any. 56 Many, indeed, were giving false witness against him, but their testimonies were not in agreement. 57 Also, certain ones were standing up and bearing false witness against him, saying: 58 \"We heard him say, 'I will throw down this temple that was made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.'\" 59 But even on these grounds, their testimony was not in agreement.\n60 Then the high priest stood up in their midst and questioned Jesus, saying: \"Do you say nothing in reply? What is it these men are testifying against you?\" 61 But he kept silent and made no reply at all. Again the high priest began to question him and said to him: \"Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed One?\" 62 Then Jesus said: \"I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven.\" 63 At this the high priest ripped his garments and said: \"What further need do we have of witnesses? 64 You heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?\" They all condemned him as deserving of death. 65 And some started to spit on him and to cover his face and hit him with their fists and say to him: \"Prophesy!\" And slapping him in the face, the court attendants took him.\n66 Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came. 67 On seeing Peter warming himself, she looked straight at him and said: \"You too were with the Nazarene, this Jesus.\" 68 But he denied it, saying: \"Neither do I know him nor do I understand what you are talking about,\" and he went outside to the entryway. 69 There the servant girl saw him and again began to say to those standing by: \"This is one of them.\" 70 Again he was denying it. And after a little while, those standing by again began saying to Peter: \"Certainly you are one of them, for you are, in fact, a Galilean.\" 71 But he started to curse and swear: \"I do not know this man of whom you speak!\" 72 Immediately a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter recalled what Jesus had said to him: \"Before a rooster crows twice, you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and began to weep.\nChapter 15\n1 Immediately at dawn, the chief priests with the elders and the scribes, indeed, the whole Sanhedrin, consulted together, and they bound Jesus and led him off and handed him over to Pilate. 2 So Pilate put the question to him: \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" In answer he said: \"You yourself say it.\" 3 But the chief priests were accusing him of many things. 4 Now Pilate began questioning him again, saying: \"Have you no reply to make? See how many charges they are bringing against you.\" 5 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.\n6 Well, from festival to festival, he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested. 7 At the time the man named Barabbas was in prison with the seditionists, who in their sedition had committed murder. 8 So the crowd came up and began to make their request according to what Pilate used to do for them. 9 He responded to them, saying: \"Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\" 10 For Pilate was aware that out of envy the chief priests had handed him over. 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead. 12 Again in reply Pilate said to them: \"What, then, should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?\" 13 Once more they cried out: \"To the stake with him!\" 14 But Pilate went on to say to them: \"Why? What bad thing did he do?\" Still they cried out all the more: \"To the stake with him!\" 15 At that Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and after having Jesus whipped, he handed him over to be executed on the stake.\n16 The soldiers now led him off into the courtyard, that is, into the governor's residence, and they called the whole body of troops together. 17 And they dressed him in purple and braided a crown of thorns and put it on him; 18 and they began to call out to him: \"Greetings, you King of the Jews!\" 19 Also, they were hitting him on the head with a reed and spitting on him, and they got on their knees and bowed down to him. 20 Finally, after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple and put his outer garments on him. And they led him out to nail him to the stake. 21 Also, they compelled into service a passerby, a certain Simon of Cyrene, coming from the countryside, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his torture stake.\n22 So they brought him to the place called Golgotha, which means, when translated, \"Skull Place.\" 23 Here they tried to give him wine drugged with myrrh, but he would not take it. 24 And they nailed him to the stake and distributed his outer garments by casting lots over them to decide who would take what. 25 It was now the third hour, and they nailed him to the stake. 26 And the inscription of the charge against him was written: \"The King of the Jews.\" 27 Moreover, they put two robbers on stakes alongside him, one on his right and one on his left. 28 -- 29 And those passing by spoke abusively to him, shaking their heads and saying: \"Ha! You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days, 30 save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.\" 31 In the same way also, the chief priests with the scribes were mocking him among themselves, saying: \"Others he saved; himself he cannot save! 32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down off the torture stake, so that we may see and believe.\" Even those who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him.\n33 When it became the sixth hour, a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth hour, Jesus called out with a loud voice: \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\" which means, when translated: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" 35 And some of those standing near, on hearing it, began to say: \"See! He is calling Elijah.\" 36 Then someone ran, soaked a sponge in sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying: \"Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.\" 37 But Jesus let out a loud cry and expired. 38 And the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. 39 Now when the army officer who was standing by with him in view saw that he had expired under these circumstances, he said: \"Certainly this man was God's Son.\"\n40 There were also women watching from a distance, among them Mary Magdalene as well as Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, 41 who used to accompany him and minister to him when he was in Galilee, and many other women who had come up together with him to Jerusalem.\n42 Now as it was already late in the afternoon, and since it was Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 43 there came Joseph of Arimathea, a reputable member of the Council, who also himself was waiting for the Kingdom of God. He took courage and went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 44 But Pilate wondered whether he could already be dead, and summoning the army officer, he asked him whether Jesus had already died. 45 So after making certain from the army officer, he granted the body to Joseph. 46 After he bought fine linen and took him down, he wrapped him in the fine linen and laid him in a tomb that was quarried out of rock; then he rolled a stone up to the entrance of the tomb. 47 But Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses continued looking at where he had been laid.\nChapter 16\n1 So when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices in order to come and apply them to his body. 2 And very early on the first day of the week when the sun had risen, they came to the tomb. 3 They were saying to one another: \"Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?\" 4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was very large. 5 When they entered into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were stunned. 6 He said to them: \"Do not be stunned. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was executed on the stake. He was raised up. He is not here. Look, here is the place where they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.'\" 8 So when they came out, they fled from the tomb, trembling and overwhelmed with emotion. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were in fear.\n",

    "text": "Luke\nChapter 1\n1 Seeing that many have undertaken to compile an account of the facts that are given full credence among us, 2 just as these were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and attendants of the message, 3 I resolved also, because I have traced all things from the start with accuracy, to write them to you in logical order, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know fully the certainty of the things that you have been taught orally.\n5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah of the division of Abijah. His wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 They both were righteous before God, walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah. 7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well along in years.\n8 Now as he was serving as priest in the assignment of his division before God, 9 according to the established practice of the priesthood it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of Jehovah. 10 And the entire multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of offering incense. 11 Jehovah's angel appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar. 12 But Zechariah became troubled at the sight, and he was overcome with fear. 13 However, the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your supplication has been favorably heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John. 14 You will have joy and great gladness, and many will rejoice over his birth, 15 for he will be great in the sight of Jehovah. But he must drink no wine or any alcoholic drink at all, and he will be filled with holy spirit even from before birth, 16 and he will turn back many of the sons of Israel to Jehovah their God. 17 Also, he will go ahead of him with Elijah's spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, in order to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.\"\n18 Zechariah said to the angel: \"How can I be sure of this? For I am old, and my wife is well along in years.\" 19 In reply the angel said to him: \"I am Gabriel, who stands near before God, and I was sent to speak with you and to declare this good news to you. 20 But look! you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their appointed time.\" 21 Meanwhile, the people continued waiting for Zechariah, and they were surprised that he delayed so long in the sanctuary. 22 When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had just seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless. 23 When the days of his holy service were completed, he went off to his home.\n24 Some days later Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself secluded for five months, saying: 25 \"This is how Jehovah has dealt with me in these days. He has turned his attention to me to take away my reproach among men.\"\n26 In her sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of David's house, and the name of the virgin was Mary. 28 And coming in, the angel said to her: \"Greetings, you highly favored one, Jehovah is with you.\" 29 But she was deeply disturbed at his words and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be. 30 So the angel said to her: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And look! you will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus. 32 This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, 33 and he will rule as King over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his Kingdom.\"\n34 But Mary said to the angel: \"How is this to be, since I am not having sexual relations with a man?\" 35 In answer the angel said to her: \"Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God's Son. 36 And look! Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her, the so-called barren woman; 37 for no declaration will be impossible for God.\" 38 Then Mary said: \"Look! Jehovah's slave girl! May it happen to me according to your declaration.\" At that the angel departed from her.\n39 So Mary set out in those days and traveled with haste into the mountainous country, to a city of Judah, 40 and she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 41 Well, as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit 42 and loudly cried out: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruitage of your womb! 43 So how is it that this privilege is mine, to have the mother of my Lord come to me? 44 For look! as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. 45 Happy too is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of those things spoken to her from Jehovah.\"\n46 And Mary said: \"My soul magnifies Jehovah, 47 and my spirit cannot keep from being overjoyed at God my Savior, 48 because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl. For look! from now on all generations will declare me happy, 49 because the powerful One has done great deeds for me, and holy is his name, 50 and for generation after generation his mercy is upon those who fear him. 51 He has acted mightily with his arm; he has scattered those who are haughty in the intention of their hearts. 52 He has brought down powerful men from thrones and has exalted lowly ones; 53 he has fully satisfied hungry ones with good things and has sent away empty-handed those who had wealth. 54 He has come to the aid of Israel his servant, remembering his mercy, 55 just as he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his offspring, forever.\" 56 Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her own home.\n57 The time now came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son. 58 And the neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah had magnified his mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. 59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the young child, and they were going to name him after his father, Zechariah. 60 But his mother said in reply: \"No! but he will be called John.\" 61 At this they said to her: \"Not one of your relatives is called by this name.\" 62 Then they asked his father by signs what he wanted him to be called. 63 So he asked for a tablet and wrote: \"John is his name.\" At this they were all amazed. 64 Instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue was set free and he began to speak, praising God. 65 And fear fell upon all those living in their neighborhood, and all these things began to be talked about in the whole mountainous country of Judea. 66 And all who heard noted it in their hearts, saying: \"What will this young child turn out to be?\" For the hand of Jehovah was indeed with him.\n67 Then Zechariah his father was filled with holy spirit, and he prophesied, saying: 68 \"Let Jehovah be praised, the God of Israel, because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance. 69 And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant, 70 just as he has spoken through the mouth of his holy prophets from of old, 71 of a salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us; 72 to show mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant, 73 the oath that he swore to Abraham our forefather, 74 to grant us, after we have been rescued from the hands of enemies, the privilege of fearlessly rendering sacred service to him 75 with loyalty and righteousness before him all our days. 76 But as for you, young child, you will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go ahead of Jehovah to prepare his ways, 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins, 78 because of the tender compassion of our God. With this compassion a daybreak will visit us from on high, 79 to give light to those sitting in darkness and death's shadow and to guide our feet in the way of peace.\"\n80 And the young child grew up and became strong in spirit, and he continued in the desert until the day he showed himself openly to Israel.\nChapter 2\n1 Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be registered. 2 (This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3 And all the people went to be registered, each one to his own city. 4 Of course, Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David's city, which is called Bethlehem, because of his being a member of the house and family of David. 5 He went to get registered with Mary, who had been given him in marriage as promised and who was soon to give birth. 6 While they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 7 And she gave birth to her son, the firstborn, and she wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the lodging place.\n8 There were also in the same region shepherds living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks. 9 Suddenly Jehovah's angel stood before them, and Jehovah's glory gleamed around them, and they became very fearful. 10 But the angel said to them: \"Do not be afraid, for look! I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have. 11 For today there was born to you in David's city a savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this is a sign for you: You will find an infant wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.\" 13 Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying: 14 \"Glory in the heights above to God, and on earth peace among men of goodwill.\"\n15 So when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another: \"Let us by all means go over to Bethlehem and see what has taken place, which Jehovah has made known to us.\" 16 And they went quickly and found Mary as well as Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. 17 When they saw this, they made known the message that they had been told concerning this young child. 18 And all who heard were astonished at what the shepherds told them, 19 but Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart. 20 Then the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.\n21 After eight days, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived.\n22 Also, when the time came for purifying them according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah, 23 just as it is written in Jehovah's Law: \"Every firstborn male must be called holy to Jehovah.\" 24 And they offered a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of Jehovah: \"a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.\"\n25 And look! there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for Israel's consolation, and holy spirit was upon him. 26 Furthermore, it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah. 27 Under the power of the spirit, he now came into the temple, and as the parents brought the young child Jesus in to do for him according to the customary practice of the Law, 28 he took the child into his arms and praised God and said: 29 \"Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration, 30 because my eyes have seen your means of salvation 31 that you have prepared in the sight of all the peoples, 32 a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel.\" 33 And the child's father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about him. 34 Also, Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, the child's mother: \"Look! This child is appointed for the falling and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign to be spoken against 35 (yes, a long sword will be run through you), in order that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.\"\n36 Now there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of Asher's tribe. This woman was well along in years and had lived with her husband for seven years after they were married, 37 and she was a widow now 84 years old. She was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fasting and supplications. 38 In that very hour she came near and began giving thanks to God and speaking about the child to all who were waiting for Jerusalem's deliverance.\n39 So when they had carried out all the things according to the Law of Jehovah, they went back into Galilee to their own city, Nazareth. 40 And the young child continued growing and getting strong, being filled with wisdom, and God's favor continued upon him.\n41 Now his parents were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover. 42 And when he was 12 years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival. 43 When the days of the festival were over and they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents did not notice it. 44 Assuming that he was in the group traveling together, they went a day's journey and then began to search for him among the relatives and acquaintances. 45 But not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem and made a diligent search for him. 46 Well, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions. 47 But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers. 48 Now when his parents saw him, they were astounded, and his mother said to him: \"Child, why did you treat us this way? Here your father and I have been frantically looking for you.\" 49 But he said to them: \"Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in the house of my Father?\" 50 However, they did not understand what he was saying to them.\n51 Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth, and he continued subject to them. Also, his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart. 52 And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men.\nChapter 3\n1 In the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod was district ruler of Galilee, Philip his brother was district ruler of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was district ruler of Abilene, 2 in the days of chief priest Annas and of Caiaphas, God's declaration came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.\n3 So he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins, 4 just as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: \"A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight. 5 Every valley must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled; the crooked ways must become straight, and the rough ways smooth; 6 and all flesh will see the salvation of God.'\"\n7 So he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: \"You offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Therefore, produce fruits that befit repentance. Do not start saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones. 9 Indeed, the ax is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n10 And the crowds were asking him: \"What, then, should we do?\" 11 In reply he said to them: \"Let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none, and let the one who has something to eat do the same.\" 12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: \"Teacher, what should we do?\" 13 He said to them: \"Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.\" 14 Also, those in military service were asking him: \"What should we do?\" And he said to them: \"Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely, but be satisfied with your provisions.\"\n15 Now the people were in expectation and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John, \"May he perhaps be the Christ?\" 16 John gave the answer, saying to all: \"I, for my part, baptize you with water, but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire. 17 His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.\"\n18 He also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people. 19 But Herod the district ruler, because of being reproved by John concerning Herodias the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod had done, 20 added this also to all those deeds: He locked John up in prison.\n21 Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus too was baptized. As he was praying, the heaven was opened up, 22 and the holy spirit in bodily form like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: \"You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.\"\n23 When Jesus began his work, he was about 30 years old, being the son, as the opinion was,\nof Joseph,\nson of Heli,\n24 son of Matthat,\nson of Levi,\nson of Melchi,\nson of Jannai,\nson of Joseph,\n25 son of Mattathias,\nson of Amos,\nson of Nahum,\nson of Esli,\nson of Naggai,\n26 son of Maath,\nson of Mattathias,\nson of Semein,\nson of Josech,\nson of Joda,\n27 son of Joanan,\nson of Rhesa,\nson of Zerubbabel,\nson of Shealtiel,\nson of Neri,\n28 son of Melchi,\nson of Addi,\nson of Cosam,\nson of Elmadam,\nson of Er,\n29 son of Jesus,\nson of Eliezer,\nson of Jorim,\nson of Matthat,\nson of Levi,\n30 son of Symeon,\nson of Judas,\nson of Joseph,\nson of Jonam,\nson of Eliakim,\n31 son of Melea,\nson of Menna,\nson of Mattatha,\nson of Nathan,\nson of David,\n32 son of Jesse,\nson of Obed,\nson of Boaz,\nson of Salmon,\nson of Nahshon,\n33 son of Amminadab,\nson of Arni,\nson of Hezron,\nson of Perez,\nson of Judah,\n34 son of Jacob,\nson of Isaac,\nson of Abraham,\nson of Terah,\nson of Nahor,\n35 son of Serug,\nson of Reu,\nson of Peleg,\nson of Eber,\nson of Shelah,\n36 son of Cainan,\nson of Arpachshad,\nson of Shem,\nson of Noah,\nson of Lamech,\n37 son of Methuselah,\nson of Enoch,\nson of Jared,\nson of Mahalaleel,\nson of Cainan,\n38 son of Enosh,\nson of Seth,\nson of Adam,\nson of God.\nChapter 4\n1 Then Jesus, full of holy spirit, turned away from the Jordan, and he was led about by the spirit in the wilderness 2 for 40 days, being tempted by the Devil. And he ate nothing in those days, so when they had ended, he felt hungry. 3 At this the Devil said to him: \"If you are a son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.\" 4 But Jesus answered him: \"It is written, 'Man must not live on bread alone.'\"\n5 So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time. 6 Then the Devil said to him: \"I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. 7 If you, therefore, do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.\" 8 In reply Jesus said to him: \"It is written, 'It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.'\"\n9 He then led him into Jerusalem and stationed him on the battlement of the temple and said to him: \"If you are a son of God, throw yourself down from here, 10 for it is written, 'He will give his angels a command concerning you, to preserve you,' 11 and, 'They will carry you on their hands, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.'\" 12 In answer Jesus said to him: \"It is said, 'You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.'\" 13 So the Devil, having finished all the temptation, departed from him until another convenient time.\n14 Now Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee. And good reports about him spread throughout all the surrounding country. 15 Also, he began to teach in their synagogues, and he was held in honor by all.\n16 He then went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and according to his custom on the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and stood up to read. 17 So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written: 18 \"Jehovah's spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away free, 19 to preach Jehovah's acceptable year.\" 20 With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them: \"Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.\"\n22 And they all began to give favorable witness about him and to be amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth, and they were saying: \"This is a son of Joseph, is it not?\" 23 At this he said to them: \"No doubt you will apply this saying to me, 'Physician, cure yourself. Do also here in your home territory the things we have heard were done in Capernaum.'\" 24 So he said: \"Truly I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home territory. 25 For instance, I tell you in truth: There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when heaven was shut up for three years and six months, and a great famine came on all the land. 26 Yet Elijah was sent to none of those women, but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon. 27 Also, there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed, only Naaman the Syrian.\" 28 Now all those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger, 29 and they rose up and rushed him outside the city, and they led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city had been built, in order to throw him down headlong. 30 But he went right through their midst and continued on his way.\n31 He then went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath, 32 and they were astounded at his way of teaching, because he spoke with authority. 33 Now in the synagogue there was a man with a spirit, an unclean demon, and he shouted with a loud voice: 34 \"Ah! What have we to do with you, Jesus the Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us? I know exactly who you are, the Holy One of God.\" 35 But Jesus rebuked it, saying: \"Be silent, and come out of him.\" So after throwing the man down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him. 36 At this they were all astonished and began to say to one another: \"What kind of speech is this? For with authority and power he orders the unclean spirits, and out they come!\" 37 So the news about him kept spreading into every corner of the surrounding country.\n38 After leaving the synagogue, he entered into Simon's home. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they asked him to help her. 39 So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Instantly she got up and began ministering to them.\n40 But when the sun was setting, all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. By laying his hands on each one of them, he cured them. 41 Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying: \"You are the Son of God.\" But rebuking them, he would not permit them to speak, for they knew him to be the Christ.\n42 However, at daybreak he departed and went to an isolated place. But the crowds began searching for him and came to where he was, and they tried to keep him from going away from them. 43 But he said to them: \"I must also declare the good news of the Kingdom of God to other cities, because for this I was sent.\" 44 So he went on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.\nChapter 5\n1 On one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. 2 And he saw two boats docked at the lakeside, but the fishermen had got out of them and were washing off their nets. 3 Going aboard one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to pull away a bit from land. Then he sat down, and he began teaching the crowds from the boat. 4 When he stopped speaking, he said to Simon: \"Pull out to where it is deep, and let down your nets for a catch.\" 5 But in reply Simon said: \"Instructor, we toiled all night and caught nothing, but at your word I will lower the nets.\" 6 Well, when they did this, they caught a great number of fish. In fact, their nets began ripping apart. 7 So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them, and they came and filled both boats, so that these began to sink. 8 Seeing this, Simon Peter fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying: \"Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man.\" 9 For both he and those with him were overwhelmed with astonishment at the catch of fish they had taken, 10 and the same was true of both James and John, Zebedee's sons, who were partners with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon: \"Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching men alive.\" 11 So they brought the boats back to land and abandoned everything and followed him.\n12 On another occasion while he was in one of the cities, look! there was a man full of leprosy! When he caught sight of Jesus, he fell facedown and begged him: \"Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.\" 13 So stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: \"I want to! Be made clean.\" Immediately the leprosy vanished from him. 14 Then he gave the man orders to tell no one: \"But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses directed, for a witness to them.\" 15 But the news about him just kept spreading, and large crowds would gather together to listen and to be cured of their sicknesses. 16 However, he often went into the desolate areas to pray.\n17 On one of those days while he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the Law who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem were sitting there; and Jehovah's power was with him to do healing. 18 And look! men were carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher, and they were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus. 19 So not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they climbed up to the roof, and they lowered him on the stretcher through the tiling, right among those in front of Jesus. 20 When he saw their faith, he said: \"Man, your sins are forgiven.\" 21 Then the scribes and the Pharisees started to reason, saying: \"Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?\" 22 But Jesus, discerning their reasoning, said in answer to them: \"What are you reasoning in your hearts? 23 Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? 24 But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins-\" he said to the paralyzed man: \"I say to you, Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.\" 25 At that he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went to his home, glorifying God. 26 Then one and all were seized with amazement, and they began to glorify God, and they became filled with awe, saying: \"We have seen wonderful things today!\"\n27 Now after this, he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: \"Be my follower.\" 28 And leaving everything behind, he rose up and began to follow him. 29 Then Levi spread a big reception feast for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were dining with them. 30 At this the Pharisees and their scribes began murmuring to his disciples, saying: \"Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?\" 31 In reply Jesus said to them: \"Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. 32 I have come to call, not righteous people, but sinners to repentance.\"\n33 They said to him: \"John's disciples fast frequently and offer supplications, and so do those of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.\" 34 Jesus said to them: \"You cannot make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you? 35 But days will come when the bridegroom will indeed be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.\"\n36 He also gave an illustration to them: \"Nobody cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, then the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old. 37 Also, no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined. 38 But new wine must be put into new wineskins. 39 No one after drinking old wine wants new, for he says, 'The old is nice.'\"\nChapter 6\n1 Now on a sabbath he was passing through grainfields, and his disciples were plucking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them with their hands. 2 At this some of the Pharisees said: \"Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?\" 3 But in reply Jesus said to them: \"Have you never read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry? 4 How he entered into the house of God and received the loaves of presentation and ate and gave some to the men with him, which it is not lawful for anyone to eat but for the priests only?\" 5 Then he said to them: \"The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.\"\n6 On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and began teaching. And a man was there whose right hand was withered. 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were now watching Jesus closely to see whether he would cure on the Sabbath, in order to find some way to accuse him. 8 He, however, knew their reasoning, so he said to the man with the withered hand: \"Get up and stand in the center.\" And he rose and stood there. 9 Then Jesus said to them: \"I ask you men, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?\" 10 After looking around at them all, he said to the man: \"Stretch out your hand.\" He did so, and his hand was restored. 11 But they flew into a senseless rage, and they began to talk over with one another what they might do to Jesus.\n12 On one of those days he went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God. 13 And when it became day, he called his disciples to him and chose from among them 12, whom he also named apostles: 14 Simon, whom he also named Peter, Andrew his brother, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 15 Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon who is called \"the zealous one,\" 16 Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who turned traitor.\n17 And he came down with them and stood on a level place, and there was a large crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 18 Even those troubled with unclean spirits were cured. 19 And all the crowd were seeking to touch him, because power was going out of him and healing them all.\n20 And he looked up at his disciples and began to say:\n\"Happy are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.\n21 \"Happy are you who hunger now, for you will be filled.\n\"Happy are you who weep now, for you will laugh.\n22 \"Happy are you whenever men hate you, and when they exclude you and reproach you and denounce your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man. 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for look! your reward is great in heaven, for those are the same things their forefathers used to do to the prophets.\n24 \"But woe to you who are rich, for you are having your consolation in full.\n25 \"Woe to you who are filled up now, for you will go hungry.\n\"Woe, you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.\n26 \"Woe whenever all men speak well of you, for this is what their forefathers did to the false prophets.\n27 \"But I say to you who are listening: Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you, 28 to bless those cursing you, to pray for those who are insulting you. 29 To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your outer garment, do not withhold the inner garment either. 30 Give to everyone asking you, and from the one taking your things away, do not ask them back.\n31 \"Also, just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.\n32 \"If you love those loving you, of what credit is it to you? For even the sinners love those loving them. 33 And if you do good to those doing good to you, of what credit is it to you? Even the sinners do the same. 34 Also, if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, of what credit is it to you? Even sinners lend to sinners so that they may get back as much. 35 On the contrary, continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without hoping for anything back; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked. 36 Continue being merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\n37 \"Moreover, stop judging, and you will by no means be judged; and stop condemning, and you will by no means be condemned. Keep on forgiving, and you will be forgiven. 38 Practice giving, and people will give to you. They will pour into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing. For with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.\"\n39 Then he also told them an illustration: \"A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Both will fall into a pit, will they not? 40 A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher. 41 Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother's eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye? 42 How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, allow me to remove the straw that is in your eye,' while you yourself do not see the rafter in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw that is in your brother's eye.\n43 \"For no fine tree produces rotten fruit, and no rotten tree produces fine fruit. 44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For example, people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they cut grapes off a thornbush. 45 A good man brings good out of the good treasure of his heart, but a wicked man brings what is wicked out of his wicked treasure; for out of the heart's abundance his mouth speaks.\n46 \"Why, then, do you call me 'Lord! Lord!' but do not do the things I say? 47 Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you whom he is like: 48 He is like a man who in building a house dug and went down deep and laid a foundation on the rock. Consequently, when a flood came, the river dashed against that house but was not strong enough to shake it, for it was well-built. 49 On the other hand, whoever hears and does nothing is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The river dashed against it, and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.\"\nChapter 7\n1 When he had completed what he had to say to the people, he entered Capernaum. 2 Now an army officer's slave, who was dear to him, was seriously ill and about to pass away. 3 When he heard about Jesus, he sent some elders of the Jews to him to ask him to come and make his slave well. 4 They came up to Jesus and began to plead with him earnestly, saying: \"He is worthy of your granting him this, 5 for he loves our nation and he himself built our synagogue.\" 6 So Jesus went with them. But when he was not far from the house, the army officer had already sent friends to say to him: \"Sir, do not bother, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. 7 That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed. 8 For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it.\" 9 When Jesus heard these things, he was amazed at him, and he turned to the crowd following him and said: \"I tell you, not even in Israel have I found so great a faith.\" 10 And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.\n11 Soon afterward he traveled to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd were traveling with him. 12 As he got near the gate of the city, why look! there was a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother. Besides, she was a widow. A considerable crowd from the city was also with her. 13 When the Lord caught sight of her, he was moved with pity for her, and he said to her: \"Stop weeping.\" 14 With that he approached and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. Then he said: \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" 15 And the dead man sat up and started to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16 Now fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying: \"A great prophet has been raised up among us,\" and, \"God has turned his attention to his people.\" 17 And this news concerning him spread out into all Judea and all the surrounding country.\n18 Now John's disciples reported to him all these things. 19 So John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask: \"Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?\" 20 When they came to him, the men said: \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect another?'\" 21 In that hour he cured many people of sicknesses, serious diseases, and wicked spirits, and he granted many blind people the gift of sight. 22 In reply he said to them: \"Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind are now seeing, the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed, the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up, and the poor are being told the good news. 23 Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me.\"\n24 When the messengers of John had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being tossed by the wind? 25 What, then, did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Why, those wearing splendid dress and living in luxury are in royal houses. 26 Really, then, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. 27 This is the one about whom it is written: 'Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way ahead of you.' 28 I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John, but a lesser person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is.\" 29 (When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be righteous, for they had been baptized with the baptism of John. 30 But the Pharisees and those versed in the Law disregarded the counsel of God to them, since they had not been baptized by him.)\n31 \"With whom, therefore, should I compare the men of this generation, and whom are they like? 32 They are like young children sitting in a marketplace and calling out to one another, saying: 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we wailed, but you did not weep.' 33 Likewise, John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, but you say: 'He has a demon.' 34 The Son of man has come eating and drinking, but you say: 'Look! A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' 35 All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by all its children.\"\n36 Now one of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him. So he entered the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table. 37 And look! a woman who was known in the city to be a sinner learned that he was dining in the house of the Pharisee, and she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil. 38 Taking a position behind him at his feet, she wept and began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them off with the hair of her head. Also, she tenderly kissed his feet and poured the perfumed oil on them. 39 Seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited him said to himself: \"If this man were really a prophet, he would know who and what kind of woman it is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.\" 40 But in reply Jesus said to him: \"Simon, I have something to say to you.\" He said: \"Teacher, say it!\"\n41 \"Two men were debtors to a certain lender; the one was in debt for 500 denarii, but the other for 50. 42 When they did not have anything to pay him back with, he freely forgave them both. Therefore, which one of them will love him more?\" 43 In answer Simon said: \"I suppose it is the one whom he forgave more.\" He said to him: \"You judged correctly.\" 44 With that he turned to the woman and said to Simon: \"Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet. But this woman wet my feet with her tears and wiped them off with her hair. 45 You gave me no kiss, but this woman, from the hour that I came in, did not stop tenderly kissing my feet. 46 You did not pour oil on my head, but this woman poured perfumed oil on my feet. 47 Because of this, I tell you, her sins, many though they are, are forgiven, because she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little.\" 48 Then he said to her: \"Your sins are forgiven.\" 49 Those reclining at the table with him started to say among themselves: \"Who is this man who even forgives sins?\" 50 But he said to the woman: \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\"\nChapter 8\n1 Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with him, 2 as were certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out; 3 Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's man in charge; Susanna; and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.\n4 Now when a large crowd had gathered together with those who went to him from city to city, he spoke by means of an illustration: 5 \"A sower went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some of them fell alongside the road and were trampled on, and the birds of heaven ate them up. 6 Some landed on the rock, and after sprouting, they dried up because they had no moisture. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them. 8 But others fell on the good soil, and after sprouting, they produced 100 times more fruit.\" As he said these things, he called out: \"Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.\"\n9 But his disciples asked him what this illustration meant. 10 He said: \"To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of God, but for the rest it is in illustrations so that, though looking, they may look in vain, and though hearing, they may not get the sense. 11 Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God. 12 Those alongside the road are the ones who have heard, and then the Devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved. 13 Those on the rock are the ones who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy, but these have no root. They believe for a while, but in a season of testing, they fall away. 14 As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, but by being carried away by anxieties, riches, and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to maturity. 15 As for that on the fine soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.\n16 \"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in may see the light. 17 For there is nothing hidden that will not become manifest, nor anything carefully concealed that will never become known and not come out in the open. 18 Therefore, pay attention to how you listen, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.\"\n19 Now his mother and brothers came to him, but they were unable to get near him because of the crowd. 20 So it was reported to him: \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\" 21 In reply he said to them: \"My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.\"\n22 One day he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them: \"Let us cross to the other side of the lake.\" So they set sail. 23 But as they were sailing along, he fell asleep. And a violent windstorm descended on the lake, and their boat began to fill up with water and to be in danger. 24 So they went and woke him up, saying: \"Instructor, Instructor, we are about to perish!\" With that he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they subsided, and a calm set in. 25 Then he said to them: \"Where is your faith?\" But they were filled with fear and were astounded, saying to one another: \"Who really is this? For he orders even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\"\n26 And they put in to shore in the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the side opposite Galilee. 27 As Jesus got out onto land, a demon-possessed man from the city met him. For a considerable time he had not worn clothing, and he was staying, not in a house, but among the tombs. 28 At the sight of Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and with a loud voice, he said: \"What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.\" 29 (For Jesus had been ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had seized him on many occasions, and he was repeatedly bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the isolated places.) 30 Jesus asked him: \"What is your name?\" He said: \"Legion,\" for many demons had entered into him. 31 And they kept pleading with him not to order them to go away into the abyss. 32 Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the mountain, so they pleaded with him to permit them to enter into the swine, and he gave them permission. 33 With that the demons came out of the man and went into the swine, and the herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and drowned. 34 But when the herders saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.\n35 Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they grew fearful. 36 Those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been made well. 37 Then a great number from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to go away from them, because they were gripped by great fear. Then he went aboard the boat to depart. 38 However, the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging to continue with him, but he sent the man away, saying: 39 \"Go back home, and keep on relating what God did for you.\" So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.\n40 When Jesus returned, the crowd received him kindly, for they were all expecting him. 41 But look! a man named Jairus came; this man was a presiding officer of the synagogue. And he fell at the feet of Jesus and began to plead with him to come to his house, 42 because his only daughter, who was about 12 years old, was dying.\nAs Jesus was going, the crowds pressed in on him. 43 Now there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years, and she had not been able to get a cure from anyone. 44 She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, and immediately her flow of blood stopped. 45 So Jesus said: \"Who touched me?\" When they were all denying it, Peter said: \"Instructor, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing against you.\" 46 But Jesus said: \"Someone touched me, for I know that power went out of me.\" 47 Seeing that she had not escaped notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and declared before all the people why she touched him and how she was healed immediately. 48 But he said to her: \"Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.\"\n49 While he was yet speaking, a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came, saying: \"Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher any longer.\" 50 On hearing this, Jesus answered him: \"Have no fear, only have faith, and she will be saved.\" 51 When he reached the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the girl's father and mother. 52 But people were all weeping and beating themselves in grief for her. So he said: \"Stop weeping, for she did not die but is sleeping.\" 53 At this they began to laugh at him scornfully, because they knew she had died. 54 But he took her by the hand and called to her: \"Child, get up!\" 55 And her spirit returned, and she rose immediately, and he ordered that something be given her to eat. 56 Well, her parents were beside themselves, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.\nChapter 9\n1 Then he called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases. 2 And he sent them out to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal, 3 and he said to them: \"Carry nothing for the trip, neither staff nor food pouch nor bread nor money; neither have two garments. 4 But wherever you enter into a home, stay there and leave from there. 5 And wherever people do not receive you, on going out of that city, shake the dust off your feet for a witness against them.\" 6 Then starting out, they went through the territory from village to village, declaring the good news and performing cures everywhere.\n7 Now Herod the district ruler heard about everything that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised up from the dead, 8 but others were saying that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen. 9 Herod said: \"John I beheaded. Who, then, is this about whom I am hearing such things?\" So he was trying to see him.\n10 When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all they had done. With that he took them along and withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida. 11 But the crowds, getting to know it, followed him. And he received them kindly and began to speak to them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those needing a cure. 12 Then the day was coming to a close. The Twelve now came up and said to him: \"Send the crowd away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and provisions, because out here we are in an isolated place.\" 13 But he said to them: \"You give them something to eat.\" They said: \"We have nothing more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we ourselves go and buy food for all these people.\" 14 There were, in fact, about 5,000 men. But he said to his disciples: \"Have them sit down in groups of about 50 each.\" 15 And they did so and had them all sit down. 16 Taking now the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke them up and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd. 17 So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftovers, 12 baskets of fragments.\n18 Later, while he was praying alone, the disciples came to him, and he questioned them, saying: \"Who are the crowds saying that I am?\" 19 In reply they said: \"John the Baptist, but others say Elijah, and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.\" 20 Then he said to them: \"You, though, who do you say I am?\" Peter answered: \"The Christ of God.\" 21 Then in a stern talk to them, he instructed them not to tell this to anybody, 22 but he said: \"The Son of man must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.\"\n23 Then he went on to say to all: \"If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and keep following me. 24 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake is the one who will save it. 25 Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers ruin? 26 For whoever becomes ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and that of the Father and of the holy angels. 27 But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Kingdom of God.\"\n28 In fact, about eight days after saying these words, he took Peter, John, and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray. 29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became glitteringly white. 30 And look! two men were conversing with him; they were Moses and Elijah. 31 These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure, which he was about to fulfill at Jerusalem. 32 Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. 33 And as these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus: \"Instructor, it is fine for us to be here. So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" He did not realize what he was saying. 34 But as he was saying these things, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them. As they entered into the cloud, they became afraid. 35 Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying: \"This is my Son, the one who has been chosen. Listen to him.\" 36 As the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet and did not report to anyone in those days any of the things they saw.\n37 The following day when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. 38 And look! a man called out from the crowd, saying: \"Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only one. 39 And look! a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming at the mouth, and only with difficulty does it leave him after bruising him. 40 I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.\" 41 In response Jesus said: \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you and put up with you? Bring your son over here.\" 42 But even as he was approaching, the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion. However, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 43 And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God.\nWhile they were all astonished at all the things he was doing, he said to his disciples: 44 \"Listen carefully and remember these words, for the Son of man is going to be betrayed into men's hands.\" 45 But they did not understand what he was saying. In fact, it was concealed from them so that they might not grasp it, and they were afraid to question him about this saying.\n46 Then a dispute arose among them about which one of them was the greatest. 47 Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a young child, stood him beside him, 48 and said to them: \"Whoever receives this young child on the basis of my name receives me also; and whoever receives me also receives the One who sent me. For the one who conducts himself as a lesser one among all of you is the one who is great.\"\n49 In response John said: \"Instructor, we saw someone expelling demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he is not following with us.\" 50 But Jesus said to him: \"Do not try to prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you.\"\n51 As the days were drawing near for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem. 52 So he sent messengers ahead of him. And they went and entered a village of Samaritans to make preparations for him. 53 But they did not receive him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem. 54 When the disciples James and John saw this, they said: \"Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?\" 55 But he turned and rebuked them. 56 So they went to a different village.\n57 Now as they were going along the road, someone said to him: \"I will follow you wherever you go.\" 58 But Jesus said to him: \"Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.\" 59 Then he said to another: \"Be my follower.\" The man said: \"Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.\" 60 But he said to him: \"Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and declare abroad the Kingdom of God.\" 61 And still another said: \"I will follow you, Lord, but first permit me to say good-bye to those in my household.\" 62 Jesus said to him: \"No man who has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well-suited for the Kingdom of God.\"\nChapter 10\n1 After these things the Lord designated 70 others and sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go. 2 Then he said to them: \"Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. 3 Go! Look! I am sending you out as lambs in among wolves. 4 Do not carry a money bag or a food pouch or sandals, and do not greet anyone along the road. 5 Wherever you enter into a house, say first: 'May this house have peace.' 6 And if a friend of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will return to you. 7 So stay in that house, eating and drinking the things they provide, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not keep transferring from house to house.\n8 \"Also, wherever you enter into a city and they receive you, eat what is set before you 9 and cure the sick ones in it and tell them: 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.' 10 But wherever you enter into a city and they do not receive you, go out into its main streets and say: 11 'We wipe off against you even the dust that sticks to our feet from your city. Nevertheless, know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near.' 12 I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodom in that day than for that city.\n13 \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! because if the powerful works that have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14 Consequently, it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you. 15 And you, Capernaum, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to the Grave you will come!\n16 \"Whoever listens to you listens to me. And whoever disregards you disregards me also. Moreover, whoever disregards me disregards also Him who sent me.\"\n17 Then the 70 returned with joy, saying: \"Lord, even the demons are made subject to us by the use of your name.\" 18 At that he said to them: \"I see Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven. 19 Look! I have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing at all will harm you. 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens.\" 21 In that very hour he became overjoyed in the holy spirit and said: \"I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have carefully hidden these things from wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children. Yes, O Father, because this is the way you approved. 22 All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.\"\n23 With that he turned to the disciples and told them privately: \"Happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing. 24 For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.\"\n25 Now look! a man versed in the Law stood up to test him and said: \"Teacher, what do I need to do to inherit everlasting life?\" 26 He said to him: \"What is written in the Law? How do you read?\" 27 In answer he said: \"'You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind' and 'your neighbor as yourself.'\" 28 He said to him: \"You answered correctly; keep doing this and you will get life.\"\n29 But wanting to prove himself righteous, the man said to Jesus: \"Who really is my neighbor?\" 30 In reply Jesus said: \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell victim to robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went off, leaving him half-dead. 31 Now by coincidence a priest was going down on that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side. 32 Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side. 33 But a certain Samaritan traveling the road came upon him, and at seeing him, he was moved with pity. 34 So he approached him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he mounted him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said: 'Take care of him, and whatever you spend besides this, I will repay you when I return.' 36 Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor to the man who fell victim to the robbers?\" 37 He said: \"The one who acted mercifully toward him.\" Jesus then said to him: \"Go and do the same yourself.\"\n38 Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village. Here a woman named Martha received him as a guest in her house. 39 She also had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying. 40 Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties. So she came to him and said: \"Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things? Tell her to come and help me.\" 41 In answer the Lord said to her: \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things. 42 A few things, though, are needed, or just one. For her part, Mary chose the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.\"\nChapter 11\n1 Now he was in a certain place praying, and when he stopped, one of his disciples said to him: \"Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.\"\n2 So he said to them: \"Whenever you pray, say: 'Father, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. 3 Give us each day our bread according to our daily needs. 4 And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation.'\"\n5 Then he said to them: \"Suppose one of you has a friend and you go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves, 6 because one of my friends has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to offer him.' 7 But that one replies from inside: 'Stop bothering me. The door is already locked, and my young children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.' 8 I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because of being his friend, certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs. 9 So I say to you, keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you. 10 For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened. 11 Indeed, which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent instead of a fish? 12 Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion? 13 Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!\"\n14 Later he expelled a speechless demon. After the demon came out, the speechless man spoke, and the crowds were amazed. 15 But some of them said: \"He expels the demons by means of Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.\" 16 And others, to test him, began demanding a sign out of heaven from him. 17 Knowing their thinking, he said to them: \"Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin, and a house divided against itself falls. 18 In the same way, if Satan is also divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub. 19 If I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub, by whom do your sons expel them? This is why they will be your judges. 20 But if it is by means of God's finger that I expel the demons, the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you. 21 When a strong, well-armed man guards his palace, his belongings remain secure. 22 But when someone stronger than he is comes against him and conquers him, that man takes away all his weapons in which he was trusting, and he divides up the things he took from him. 23 Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\n24 \"When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through waterless places in search of a resting-place, and after finding none, it says, 'I will return to my house from which I moved.' 25 And on arriving, it finds the house swept clean and adorned. 26 Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and after getting inside, they dwell there. So the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first.\"\n27 Now as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd called out to him: \"Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you!\" 28 But he said: \"No, rather, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!\"\n29 When the crowds were massing together, he began to say: \"This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. 30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of man be to this generation. 31 The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look! something more than Solomon is here. 32 The men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at what Jonah preached. But look! something more than Jonah is here. 33 After lighting a lamp, a person puts it, not in a hidden place nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light. 34 The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is focused, your whole body is also bright; but when it is envious, your body is also dark. 35 Be alert, therefore, that the light that is in you is not darkness. 36 Therefore, if your whole body is bright with no part of it dark, it will all be as bright as when a lamp gives you light by its rays.\"\n37 When he had said this, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table. 38 However, the Pharisee was surprised at seeing that he did not first wash before the dinner. 39 But the Lord said to him: \"Now you Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greediness and wickedness. 40 Unreasonable ones! The one who made the outside made also the inside, did he not? 41 But give as gifts of mercy the things that are from within, and look! everything about you will be clean. 42 But woe to you Pharisees, because you give the tenth of the mint and of the rue and of every other garden herb, but you disregard the justice and the love of God! These things you were under obligation to do, but not to disregard those other things. 43 Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the front seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces! 44 Woe to you, because you are as those graves that are not clearly visible, that men walk on and do not know it!\"\n45 In reply one of those versed in the Law said to him: \"Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us also.\" 46 Then he said: \"Woe also to you who are versed in the Law, because you load men down with loads hard to carry, but you yourselves do not touch the loads with one of your fingers!\n47 \"Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, but your forefathers killed them! 48 Certainly you are witnesses of the deeds of your forefathers, and yet you approve of them, for they killed the prophets but you are building their tombs. 49 That is why the wisdom of God also said: 'I will send prophets and apostles to them, and they will kill and persecute some of them, 50 so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be charged against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house.' Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.\n52 \"Woe to you who are versed in the Law, because you took away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not go in, and you hinder those going in!\"\n53 So when he went out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to put extreme pressure on him and to ply him with many more questions, 54 lying in wait for him to catch him in something he might say.\nChapter 12\n1 In the meantime, when a crowd of so many thousands had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, he started by saying first to his disciples: \"Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2 But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known. 3 Therefore, whatever you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in private rooms will be preached from the housetops. 4 Moreover, I say to you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more. 5 But I will show you whom to fear: Fear the One who after killing has authority to throw into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One. 6 Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 7 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.\n8 \"I say to you, everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God. 9 But whoever disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God. 10 And everyone who says a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven. 11 When they bring you in before public assemblies, government officials, and authorities, do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense or what you will say, 12 for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say.\"\n13 Then someone in the crowd said to him: \"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\" 14 He said to him: \"Man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?\" 15 Then he said to them: \"Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.\" 16 With that he told them an illustration, saying: \"The land of a rich man produced well. 17 So he began reasoning within himself, 'What should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?' 18 Then he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my grain and all my goods, 19 and I will say to myself: \"You have many good things stored up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.\"' 20 But God said to him, 'Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?' 21 So it goes with the man who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.\"\n22 Then he said to his disciples: \"That is why I say to you, stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear. 23 For the life is worth more than food and the body more than clothing. 24 Consider the ravens: They neither sow seed nor reap; they have neither barn nor storehouse; yet God feeds them. Are you not worth much more than birds? 25 Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span? 26 If, therefore, you cannot do such a small thing, why be anxious about the remaining things? 27 Consider how the lilies grow: They neither toil nor spin; but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. 28 Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much more will he clothe you, you with little faith! 29 So stop seeking what you will eat and what you will drink, and stop being in anxious suspense; 30 for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing, but your Father knows you need these things. 31 Instead, keep seeking his Kingdom, and these things will be added to you.\n32 \"Have no fear, little flock, for your Father has approved of giving you the Kingdom. 33 Sell your belongings and give gifts of mercy. Make money pouches that do not wear out, a never-failing treasure in the heavens, where no thief gets near and no moth consumes. 34 For where your treasure is, there your hearts will be also.\n35 \"Be dressed and ready and have your lamps burning, 36 and you should be like men waiting for their master to return from the marriage, so when he comes and knocks, they may at once open to him. 37 Happy are those slaves whom the master on coming finds watching! Truly I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come alongside and minister to them. 38 And if he comes in the second watch, even if in the third, and finds them ready, happy are they! 39 But know this, if the householder had known at what hour the thief would come, he would not have let his house be broken into. 40 You also, keep ready, because at an hour that you do not think likely, the Son of man is coming.\"\n41 Then Peter said: \"Lord, are you telling this illustration just to us or also to everyone?\" 42 And the Lord said: \"Who really is the faithful steward, the discreet one, whom his master will appoint over his body of attendants to keep giving them their measure of food supplies at the proper time? 43 Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so! 44 I tell you truthfully, he will appoint him over all his belongings. 45 But if ever that slave should say in his heart, 'My master delays coming,' and starts to beat the male and female servants and to eat and drink and get drunk, 46 the master of that slave will come on a day that he is not expecting him and at an hour that he does not know, and he will punish him with the greatest severity and assign him a part with the unfaithful ones. 47 Then that slave who understood the will of his master but did not get ready or do what he asked will be beaten with many strokes. 48 But the one who did not understand and yet did things deserving of strokes will be beaten with few. Indeed, everyone to whom much was given, much will be demanded of him, and the one who was put in charge of much will have more than usual demanded of him.\n49 \"I came to start a fire on the earth, and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lit? 50 Indeed, I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how I am distressed until it is finished! 51 Do you think I came to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. 52 For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two and two against three. 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\"\n54 Then he also said to the crowds: \"When you see a cloud rising in the west, at once you say, 'A storm is coming,' and it happens. 55 And when you see that a south wind is blowing, you say, 'There will be a heat wave,' and it occurs. 56 Hypocrites, you know how to examine the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to examine this particular time? 57 Why do you not judge also for yourselves what is righteous? 58 For example, when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler, while on the way, get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge, and the judge deliver you to the court officer, and the court officer throw you into prison. 59 I tell you, you will certainly not get out of there until you pay over your last small coin.\"\nChapter 13\n1 At that time some who were present reported to him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 In reply he said to them: \"Do you think that those Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans because they have suffered these things? 3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise be destroyed. 4 Or those 18 on whom the tower in Siloam fell, killing them-do you think that they had greater guilt than all other men who live in Jerusalem? 5 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all be destroyed, as they were.\"\n6 Then he went on to tell this illustration: \"A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found none. 7 Then he said to the vinedresser, 'Here it is three years that I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, but have found none. Cut it down! Why should it keep the ground useless?' 8 In reply he said to him, 'Master, leave it alone for one more year until I dig around it and put on manure. 9 If it produces fruit in the future, well and good; but if not, then cut it down.'\"\n10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 11 And look! a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness for 18 years; and she was bent double and was unable to straighten up at all. 12 When he saw her, Jesus addressed her and said: \"Woman, you are released from your weakness.\" 13 And he laid his hands on her, and instantly she straightened up and began to glorify God. 14 But in response the presiding officer of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus did the cure on the Sabbath, said to the crowd: \"There are six days on which work ought to be done; so come and be cured on those days, and not on the Sabbath day.\" 15 However, the Lord answered him: \"Hypocrites, does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his bull or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to give it something to drink? 16 Should not this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham and whom Satan held bound for 18 years, be released from this bondage on the Sabbath day?\" 17 Well, when he said these things, all his opposers began to feel shame, but the entire crowd began to rejoice at all the glorious things he did.\n18 So he went on to say: \"What is the Kingdom of God like, and with what can I compare it? 19 It is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of heaven nested in its branches.\"\n20 And again he said: \"With what can I compare the Kingdom of God? 21 It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented.\"\n22 And he traveled from city to city and from village to village, teaching and continuing on his journey to Jerusalem. 23 Now a man said to him: \"Lord, are those being saved few?\" He said to them: 24 \"Exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to get in but will not be able. 25 When the householder gets up and locks the door, you will stand outside knocking at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us.' But in answer he will say to you: 'I do not know where you are from.' 26 Then you will start saying, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our main streets.' 27 But he will say to you, 'I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, all you workers of unrighteousness!' 28 There is where your weeping and the gnashing of your teeth will be, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown outside. 29 Furthermore, people will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the Kingdom of God. 30 And look! there are those last who will be first, and there are those first who will be last.\"\n31 In that very hour some of the Pharisees came up and told him: \"Get out and go away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.\" 32 And he said to them: \"Go and tell that fox, 'Look! I am casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will be finished.' 33 Nevertheless, I must go on today, tomorrow, and the following day, because it cannot be that a prophet should be put to death outside of Jerusalem. 34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to her-how often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings! But you did not want it. 35 Look! Your house is abandoned to you. I tell you, you will by no means see me until you say: 'Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name!'\"\nChapter 14\n1 On another occasion he went to eat a meal in the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath, and they were closely watching him. 2 And look! a man who had dropsy was in front of him. 3 So in response Jesus asked those versed in the Law and the Pharisees: \"Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath or not?\" 4 But they kept silent. With that he took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away. 5 Then he said to them: \"Who of you, if his son or bull falls into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?\" 6 And they were not able to reply to this.\n7 He then told the invited men an illustration when he noticed how they were choosing the most prominent places for themselves. He said to them: 8 \"When you are invited by someone to a marriage feast, do not recline in the most prominent place. Perhaps someone more distinguished than you may also have been invited. 9 Then the one who invited you both will come and say to you, 'Let this man have your place.' Then you will proceed with shame to take the lowest place. 10 But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, so that when the man who invited you comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, go on up higher.' Then you will have honor in front of all your fellow guests. 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n12 Next he said also to the man who had invited him: \"When you spread a dinner or an evening meal, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors. Otherwise, they might also invite you in return, and it would become a repayment to you. 13 But when you spread a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; 14 and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones.\"\n15 On hearing these things, one of the fellow guests said to him: \"Happy is the one who dines in the Kingdom of God.\"\n16 Jesus said to him: \"A man was spreading a grand evening meal, and he invited many. 17 He sent his slave out at the hour of the evening meal to say to the invited ones, 'Come, because everything is now ready.' 18 But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I bought a field and need to go out and see it; I ask you, have me excused.' 19 And another said, 'I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them; I ask you, have me excused.' 20 Still another said, 'I just got married, and for this reason I cannot come.' 21 So the slave came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his slave, 'Go out quickly to the main streets and the alleys of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.' 22 In time the slave said, 'Master, what you ordered has been done, and still there is room.' 23 So the master said to the slave, 'Go out to the roads and the lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled. 24 For I say to you, none of those men who were invited will taste my evening meal.'\"\n25 Now large crowds were traveling with him, and he turned and said to them: 26 \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. 27 Whoever does not carry his torture stake and come after me cannot be my disciple. 28 For example, who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it? 29 Otherwise, he might lay its foundation but not be able to finish it, and all the onlookers would start to ridicule him, 30 saying: 'This man started to build but was not able to finish.' 31 Or what king marching out against another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with 10,000 troops to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20,000? 32 If, in fact, he cannot do so, then while that one is yet far away, he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace. 33 In the same way, you may be sure that not one of you who does not say good-bye to all his belongings can be my disciple.\n34 \"Salt, to be sure, is fine. But if the salt loses its strength, with what will it be seasoned? 35 It is not suitable for soil or for manure. People throw it away. Let the one who has ears to listen, listen.\"\nChapter 15\n1 Now all the tax collectors and the sinners kept gathering around him to hear him. 2 And both the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering: \"This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.\" 3 Then he told them this illustration, saying: 4 \"What man among you with 100 sheep, on losing one of them, will not leave the 99 behind in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it? 5 And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders and rejoices. 6 And when he gets home, he calls his friends and his neighbors together, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' 7 I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance.\n8 \"Or what woman who has ten drachma coins, if she loses one of the drachmas, does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it? 9 And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma coin that I had lost.' 10 In the same way, I tell you, joy arises among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.\"\n11 Then he said: \"A man had two sons. 12 And the younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that should come to me.' So he divided his belongings between them. 13 A few days later, the younger son gathered all his things together and traveled to a distant country and there squandered his property by living a debauched life. 14 When he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he fell into need. 15 He even went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to herd swine. 16 And he longed to be filled with the carob pods that the swine were eating, but no one would give him anything.\n17 \"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, while I am dying here from hunger! 18 I will get up and travel to my father and say to him: \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 19 I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.\"' 20 So he got up and went to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him. 21 Then the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy of being called your son.' 22 But the father said to his slaves, 'Quick! bring out a robe, the best one, and clothe him with it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. 23 Also bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat and celebrate, 24 for this son of mine was dead but has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.' And they started to enjoy themselves.\n25 \"Now his older son was in the field, and as he returned and got near the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 So he called one of the servants to him and asked what was happening. 27 He said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father slaughtered the fattened calf because he got him back in good health.' 28 But he became angry and refused to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him. 29 In reply he said to his father, 'Look! These many years I have slaved for you and never once did I disobey your orders, and yet you never once gave me a young goat to enjoy with my friends. 30 But as soon as this son of yours arrived who squandered your belongings with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fattened calf for him.' 31 Then he said to him, 'My son, you have always been with me, and all the things that are mine are yours. 32 But we just had to celebrate and rejoice, for your brother was dead but has come to life; he was lost and has been found.'\"\nChapter 16\n1 Then he also said to the disciples: \"A rich man had a steward who was accused of handling his goods wastefully. 2 So he called him and said, 'What is this I hear about you? Hand in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer manage the house.' 3 Then the steward said to himself, 'What am I to do, seeing that my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. 4 Ah! I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, people will welcome me into their homes.' 5 And calling to him each one of his master's debtors, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?' 6 He replied, 'A hundred measures of olive oil.' He said to him, 'Take back your written agreement and sit down and quickly write 50.' 7 Next, he said to another one, 'Now you, how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred large measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take back your written agreement and write 80.' 8 And his master commended the steward, though unrighteous, because he acted with practical wisdom; for the sons of this system of things are wiser in a practical way toward their own generation than the sons of the light are.\n9 \"Also, I say to you: Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that when such fail, they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places. 10 The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much. 11 Therefore, if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous riches, who will entrust you with what is true? 12 And if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with what belongs to another, who will give you something for yourselves? 13 No servant can be a slave to two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot be slaves to God and to Riches.\"\n14 Now the Pharisees, who were money lovers, were listening to all these things, and they began to sneer at him. 15 So he said to them: \"You are those who declare yourselves righteous before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is considered exalted by men is a disgusting thing in God's sight.\n16 \"The Law and the Prophets were until John. From then on, the Kingdom of God is being declared as good news, and every sort of person is pressing forward toward it. 17 Indeed, it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to go unfulfilled.\n18 \"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\n19 \"There was a rich man who used to dress in purple and linen, enjoying himself day after day with magnificence. 20 But a beggar named Lazarus used to be put at his gate, covered with ulcers 21 and desiring to be filled with the things dropping from the table of the rich man. Yes, even the dogs would come and lick his ulcers. 22 Now in the course of time, the beggar died and was carried off by the angels to Abraham's side.\n\"Also, the rich man died and was buried. 23 And in the Grave he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and he saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this blazing fire.' 25 But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you had your fill of good things in your lifetime, but Lazarus for his part received bad things. Now, however, he is being comforted here, but you are in anguish. 26 And besides all these things, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who want to go over from here to you cannot, neither may people cross over from there to us.' 27 Then he said, 'That being so, I ask you, father, to send him to the house of my father, 28 for I have five brothers, in order that he may give them a thorough witness so that they will not also come into this place of torment.' 29 But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to these.' 30 Then he said, 'No, indeed, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' 31 But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.'\"\nChapter 17\n1 Then he said to his disciples: \"It is unavoidable that causes for stumbling should come. Nevertheless, woe to the one through whom they come! 2 It would be more advantageous for him if a millstone were hung from his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to stumble one of these little ones. 3 Pay attention to yourselves. If your brother commits a sin, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. 4 Even if he sins seven times a day against you and he comes back to you seven times, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.\"\n5 Now the apostles said to the Lord: \"Give us more faith.\" 6 Then the Lord said: \"If you had faith the size of a mustard grain, you would say to this black mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea!' and it would obey you.\n7 \"Which one of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding would say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come here at once and dine at the table'? 8 Rather, will he not say to him, 'Get something ready for me to have my evening meal, and put on an apron and serve me until I finish eating and drinking, and afterward you can eat and drink'? 9 He will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did what was assigned, will he? 10 Likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you, say: 'We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.'\"\n11 While he was going to Jerusalem, he was passing between Samaria and Galilee. 12 And as he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him, but they stood at a distance. 13 And they raised their voices and said: \"Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!\" 14 When he saw them, he said to them: \"Go and show yourselves to the priests.\" Then as they were going off, they were cleansed. 15 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. 16 And he fell facedown at Jesus' feet, thanking him. Furthermore, he was a Samaritan. 17 In reply Jesus said: \"All ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine? 18 Did no one else turn back to give glory to God except this man of another nation?\" 19 Then he said to him: \"Get up and be on your way; your faith has made you well.\"\n20 On being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming, he answered them: \"The Kingdom of God is not coming with striking observableness; 21 nor will people say, 'See here!' or, 'There!' For look! the Kingdom of God is in your midst.\"\n22 Then he said to the disciples: \"Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but you will not see it. 23 And people will say to you, 'See there!' or, 'See here!' Do not go out or chase after them. 24 For just as lightning flashes from one part of heaven to another part of heaven, so the Son of man will be in his day. 25 First, however, he must undergo many sufferings and be rejected by this generation. 26 Moreover, just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of man: 27 they were eating, they were drinking, men were marrying, women were being given in marriage until that day when Noah entered into the ark, and the Flood came and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise, just as it occurred in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building. 29 But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all. 30 It will be the same on that day when the Son of man is revealed.\n31 \"On that day let the person who is on the housetop but whose belongings are in the house not come down to pick these up, and likewise, the person out in the field must not return to the things behind. 32 Remember the wife of Lot. 33 Whoever seeks to keep his life safe will lose it, but whoever loses it will preserve it alive. 34 I tell you, in that night two people will be in one bed; the one will be taken along, but the other will be abandoned. 35 There will be two women grinding at the same mill; the one will be taken along, but the other will be abandoned.\" 36 -- 37 So in response they said to him: \"Where, Lord?\" He said to them: \"Where the body is, there also the eagles will be gathered together.\"\nChapter 18\n1 Then he went on to tell them an illustration about the need for them always to pray and not to give up, 2 saying: \"In a certain city there was a judge who had no fear of God and no respect for man. 3 There was also a widow in that city who kept going to him and saying, 'See that I get justice from my legal opponent.' 4 Well, for a while he was unwilling, but afterward he said to himself, 'Although I do not fear God or respect any man, 5 because this widow keeps making me trouble, I will see that she gets justice so that she will not keep coming and wearing me out with her demand.'\" 6 Then the Lord said: \"Hear what the judge, although unrighteous, said! 7 Certainly, then, will not God cause justice to be done for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, while he is patient toward them? 8 I tell you, he will cause justice to be done to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man arrives, will he really find this faith on the earth?\"\n9 He also told this illustration to some who trusted in their own righteousness and who considered others as nothing: 10 \"Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself, 'O God, I thank you that I am not like everyone else-extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers-or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week; I give the tenth of all things I acquire.' 13 But the tax collector, standing at a distance, was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward but kept beating his chest, saying, 'O God, be gracious to me, a sinner.' 14 I tell you, this man went down to his home and was proved more righteous than that Pharisee. Because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated, but whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n15 Now people were also bringing him their infants for him to touch them, but on seeing this, the disciples began to reprimand them. 16 However, Jesus called the infants to him, saying: \"Let the young children come to me, and do not try to stop them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such ones. 17 Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a young child will by no means enter into it.\"\n18 And one of the rulers questioned him, saying: \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit everlasting life?\" 19 Jesus said to him: \"Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except one, God. 20 You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.'\" 21 Then he said: \"All of these I have kept from youth on.\" 22 After hearing that, Jesus said to him, \"There is still one thing lacking about you: Sell all the things you have and distribute the proceeds to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come be my follower.\" 23 When he heard this, he became deeply grieved, for he was very rich.\n24 Jesus looked at him and said: \"How difficult it will be for those having money to make their way into the Kingdom of God! 25 It is easier, in fact, for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.\" 26 Those who heard this said: \"Who possibly can be saved?\" 27 He said: \"The things impossible with men are possible with God.\" 28 But Peter said: \"Look! We have left what was ours and followed you.\" 29 He said to them: \"Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God 30 who will not get many times more in this period of time, and in the coming system of things, everlasting life.\"\n31 Then he took the Twelve aside and said to them: \"Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by means of the prophets about the Son of man will be accomplished. 32 For instance, he will be handed over to men of the nations and will be mocked and treated insolently and spat on. 33 And after scourging him, they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.\" 34 However, they did not get the meaning of any of these things, for these words were hidden from them, and they did not understand the things said.\n35 Now as Jesus was getting near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road begging. 36 Because he heard a crowd passing by, he began to inquire what was going on. 37 They reported to him: \"Jesus the Nazarene is passing by!\" 38 At that he cried out: \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" 39 And those who were in front began rebuking him, telling him to keep quiet, but all the more he kept shouting: \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" 40 Then Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him. After he came near, Jesus asked him: 41 \"What do you want me to do for you?\" He said: \"Lord, let me recover my sight.\" 42 So Jesus said to him: \"Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.\" 43 And instantly he recovered his sight, and he began to follow him, glorifying God. Also, at seeing it, all the people gave praise to God.\nChapter 19\n1 He then entered Jericho and was passing through. 2 Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 3 Well, he was trying to see who this Jesus was, but he could not see because of the crowd, since he was short. 4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see him, for he was about to pass that way. 5 Now when Jesus got to the place, he looked up and said to him: \"Zacchaeus, hurry and get down, for today I must stay in your house.\" 6 With that he hurried down and joyfully welcomed him as a guest. 7 When they saw this, they were all muttering: \"He went as a guest to the house of a man who is a sinner.\" 8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord: \"Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted from anyone, I am restoring four times over.\" 9 At this Jesus said to him: \"Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.\"\n11 While they were listening to these things, he told another illustration, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the Kingdom of God was going to appear instantly. 12 So he said: \"A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return. 13 Calling ten of his slaves, he gave them ten minas and told them, 'Do business with these until I come.' 14 But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him to say, 'We do not want this man to become king over us.'\n15 \"When he eventually got back after having secured the kingly power, he summoned the slaves to whom he had given the money, in order to ascertain what they had gained by their business activity. 16 So the first one came forward and said, 'Lord, your mina gained ten minas.' 17 He said to him, 'Well done, good slave! Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities.' 18 Now the second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, made five minas.' 19 He said to this one as well, 'You too be in charge of five cities.' 20 But another one came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina that I kept hidden away in a cloth. 21 You see, I was in fear of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.' 22 He said to him, 'By your own words I judge you, wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I am a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? 23 So why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my coming, I would have collected it with interest.'\n24 \"With that he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.' 25 But they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'- 26 'I say to you, to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 27 Moreover, bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me.'\"\n28 After he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 29 And when he got near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, 30 saying: \"Go into the village that is within sight, and after you enter it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here. 31 But if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you must say, 'The Lord needs it.'\" 32 So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had said to them. 33 But as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them: \"Why are you untying the colt?\" 34 They said: \"The Lord needs it.\" 35 And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their outer garments on the colt and seated Jesus on it.\n36 As he moved along, they were spreading their outer garments on the road. 37 As soon as he got near the road down the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the powerful works they had seen, 38 saying: \"Blessed is the one coming as the King in Jehovah's name! Peace in heaven, and glory in the heights above!\" 39 However, some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: \"Teacher, rebuke your disciples.\" 40 But in reply he said: \"I tell you, if these remained silent, the stones would cry out.\"\n41 And when he got nearby, he viewed the city and wept over it, 42 saying: \"If you, even you, had discerned on this day the things having to do with peace-but now they have been hidden from your eyes. 43 Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege you from every side. 44 They will dash you and your children within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.\"\n45 Then he entered the temple and started to throw out those who were selling, 46 saying to them: \"It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a cave of robbers.\"\n47 He continued teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal ones of the people were seeking to kill him; 48 but they did not find any way to do this, for the people one and all kept hanging on to him to hear him.\nChapter 20\n1 On one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple and declaring the good news, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came 2 and said to him: \"Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority?\" 3 He replied to them: \"I will also ask you a question, and you tell me: 4 Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?\" 5 Then they drew conclusions among themselves, saying: \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?' 6 But if we say, 'From men,' the people one and all will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.\" 7 So they replied that they did not know its source. 8 Jesus said to them: \"Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.\"\n9 Then he began to tell the people this illustration: \"A man planted a vineyard and leased it to cultivators, and he traveled abroad for a considerable time. 10 In due season he sent a slave to the cultivators so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. The cultivators, however, sent him away empty-handed, after beating him. 11 But again he sent another slave. That one also they beat and humiliated and sent away empty-handed. 12 Yet again he sent a third; this one also they wounded and threw out. 13 At this the owner of the vineyard said, 'What should I do? I will send my son, the beloved. They will likely respect this one.' 14 When the cultivators caught sight of him, they reasoned with one another, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours.' 15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and kill these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others.\"\nOn hearing this, they said: \"Never may that happen!\" 17 But he looked straight at them and said: \"What, then, does this mean where it is written: 'The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone'? 18 Everyone falling on that stone will be shattered. As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.\"\n19 The scribes and the chief priests then sought to get their hands on him in that very hour, but they feared the people, for they realized that he told this illustration with them in mind. 20 And after observing him closely, they sent men whom they had secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous in order to catch him in his speech, so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor. 21 And they questioned him, saying: \"Teacher, we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality, but you teach the way of God in line with truth: 22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\" 23 But he detected their cunning and said to them: 24 \"Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?\" They said: \"Caesar's.\" 25 He said to them: \"By all means, then, pay back Caesar's things to Caesar but God's things to God.\" 26 Well, they were not able to trap him in his speech before the people, but amazed at his answer, they became silent.\n27 However, some of the Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him: 28 \"Teacher, Moses wrote us, 'If a man's brother dies, leaving a wife, but he was childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.' 29 Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife but died childless. 30 So the second 31 and the third married her. Likewise even all seven; they died and left no children. 32 Finally the woman also died. 33 Consequently, in the resurrection, whose wife will she become? For the seven had her as a wife.\"\n34 Jesus said to them: \"The children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage, 35 but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. 36 In fact, neither can they die anymore, for they are like the angels, and they are God's children by being children of the resurrection. 37 But that the dead are raised up, even Moses made known in the account about the thornbush, when he calls Jehovah 'the God of Abraham and God of Isaac and God of Jacob.' 38 He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.\" 39 In response some of the scribes said: \"Teacher, you spoke well.\" 40 For they no longer had the courage to ask him a single question.\n41 In turn he asked them: \"How is it they say that the Christ is David's son? 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'Jehovah said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand 43 until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.\"' 44 David, therefore, calls him Lord; so how is he his son?\"\n45 Then, while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples: 46 \"Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and front seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at evening meals, 47 and who devour the houses of the widows and for show make long prayers. These will receive a more severe judgment.\"\nChapter 21\n1 Now as he looked up, he saw the rich dropping their gifts into the treasury chests. 2 Then he saw a needy widow drop in two small coins of very little value, 3 and he said: \"Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than they all did. 4 For all of these put in gifts out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, put in all the means of living she had.\"\n5 Later, when some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with fine stones and dedicated things, 6 he said: \"As for these things that you now see, the days will come when not a stone will be left upon a stone and not be thrown down.\" 7 Then they questioned him, saying: \"Teacher, when will these things actually be, and what will be the sign when these things are to occur?\" 8 He said: \"Look out that you are not misled, for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The due time is near.' Do not go after them. 9 Furthermore, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified. For these things must take place first, but the end will not occur immediately.\"\n10 Then he said to them: \"Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 11 There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs.\n12 \"But before all these things happen, people will lay their hands on you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name. 13 It will result in your giving a witness. 14 Therefore, resolve in your hearts not to rehearse beforehand how to make your defense, 15 for I will give you words and wisdom that all your opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute. 16 Moreover, you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death, 17 and you will be hated by all people because of my name. 18 But not even a hair of your heads will perish. 19 By your endurance you will preserve your lives.\n20 \"However, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near. 21 Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, let those in the midst of her leave, and let those in the countryside not enter into her, 22 because these are days for meting out justice in order that all the things written may be fulfilled. 23 Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days! For there will be great distress on the land and wrath against this people. 24 And they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.\n25 \"Also, there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation. 26 People will become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 27 And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 But as these things start to occur, stand up straight and lift up your heads, because your deliverance is getting near.\"\n29 With that he told them an illustration: \"Notice the fig tree and all the other trees. 30 When they are budding, you see it for yourselves and know that now the summer is near. 31 Likewise also you, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near. 32 Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all things happen. 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.\n34 \"But pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you 35 as a snare. For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth. 36 Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the Son of man.\"\n37 So by day he would be teaching in the temple, but by night he would go out and lodge on the mountain called the Mount of Olives. 38 And all the people would come to him early in the morning to hear him in the temple.\nChapter 22\n1 Now the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, which is called Passover, was getting near. 2 And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for an effective way to get rid of him, because they were afraid of the people. 3 Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was numbered among the Twelve, 4 and he went off and talked with the chief priests and temple captains about how to betray him to them. 5 They were delighted at this and agreed to give him silver money. 6 So he consented and began looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them without a crowd around.\n7 The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived, on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered; 8 so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying: \"Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.\" 9 They said to him: \"Where do you want us to get it ready?\" 10 He said to them: \"Look! When you enter into the city, a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters. 11 And say to the landlord of the house, 'The Teacher says to you: \"Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\"' 12 And that man will show you a large, furnished upper room. Get it ready there.\" 13 So they left and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.\n14 So when the hour came, he reclined at the table along with the apostles. 15 And he said to them: \"I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; 16 for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.\" 17 And accepting a cup, he gave thanks and said: \"Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves, 18 for I tell you, from now on, I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.\"\n19 Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: \"This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.\" 20 Also, he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal, saying: \"This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.\n21 \"But look! the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table. 22 For, indeed, the Son of man is going his way according to what has been determined; all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!\" 23 So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this.\n24 However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest. 25 But he said to them: \"The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors. 26 You, though, are not to be that way. But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the one taking the lead as the one ministering. 27 For which one is greater, the one dining or the one serving? Is it not the one dining? But I am among you as the one serving.\n28 \"However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials; 29 and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom, 30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of Israel.\n31 \"Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat. 32 But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.\" 33 Then he said to him: \"Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.\" 34 But he said: \"I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.\"\n35 He also said to them: \"When I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?\" They said: \"No!\" 36 Then he said to them: \"But now let the one who has a money bag take it, likewise a food pouch, and let the one who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one. 37 For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me, namely, 'He was counted with lawless ones.' For this is being fulfilled concerning me.\" 38 Then they said: \"Lord, look! here are two swords.\" He said to them: \"It is enough.\"\n39 On leaving, he went as was his custom to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him. 40 On arriving at the place, he said to them: \"Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation.\" 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw away, and he bent his knees and began to pray, 42 saying: \"Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.\" 43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. 44 But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground. 45 When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples, he found them slumbering, exhausted from grief. 46 He said to them: \"Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep praying, so that you do not enter into temptation.\"\n47 While he was still speaking, look! a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them, and he approached Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him: \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss?\" 49 When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said: \"Lord, should we strike with the sword?\" 50 One of them even struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his right ear. 51 But in reply Jesus said: \"That is enough.\" And he touched the ear and healed him. 52 Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come there for him: \"Did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber? 53 While I was with you in the temple day after day, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.\"\n54 Then they arrested him and led him off, and they brought him into the house of the high priest; but Peter was following at a distance. 55 When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting among them. 56 But a servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light of the fire, looked closely at him and said: \"This man was also with him.\" 57 But he denied it, saying: \"I do not know him, woman.\" 58 After a short time another person saw him and said: \"You too are one of them.\" But Peter said: \"Man, I am not.\" 59 And after about an hour had passed, another man began insisting strongly: \"Certainly this man was also with him, for he is, in fact, a Galilean!\" 60 But Peter said: \"Man, I do not know what you are saying.\" And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 61 At this the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter recalled the statement of the Lord when he had said to him: \"Before a rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\" 62 And he went outside and wept bitterly.\n63 Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock him, hitting him; 64 and after covering his face, they kept asking: \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\" 65 And they said many other blasphemous things against him.\n66 And when it became day, the assembly of elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they led him into their Sanhedrin hall and said: 67 \"If you are the Christ, tell us.\" But he said to them: \"Even if I told you, you would not believe it at all. 68 Moreover, if I questioned you, you would not answer. 69 However, from now on the Son of man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God.\" 70 At this they all said: \"Are you, therefore, the Son of God?\" He said to them: \"You yourselves are saying that I am.\" 71 They said: \"Why do we need further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it out of his own mouth.\"\nChapter 23\n1 So the multitude got up, one and all, and led him to Pilate. 2 Then they began to accuse him, saying: \"We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar, and saying he himself is Christ a king.\" 3 Now Pilate asked him the question: \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" In answer he said: \"You yourself are saying it.\" 4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds: \"I find no crime in this man.\" 5 But they insisted, saying: \"He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee even to here.\" 6 On hearing that, Pilate asked whether the man was a Galilean. 7 After ascertaining that he was under the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him on to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.\n8 When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly. For a considerable time he had been wanting to see Jesus because he had heard much about him, and he was hoping to see some sign performed by him. 9 So he began to question him at length, but he gave him no answer. 10 However, the chief priests and the scribes kept standing up and vehemently accusing him. 11 Then Herod together with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and he mocked him by clothing him with a splendid garment and then sent him back to Pilate. 12 Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that very day, for before that they had been at enmity with each other.\n13 Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people 14 and said to them: \"You brought this man to me as one inciting the people to revolt. Now look! I examined him in front of you but found in this man no grounds for the charges you are bringing against him. 15 In fact, neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us, and look! he has done nothing deserving of death. 16 I will therefore punish him and release him.\" 17 -- 18 But the whole crowd shouted out: \"Do away with this man, and release Barabbas to us!\" 19 (This man had been thrown into prison for sedition that had occurred in the city and for murder.) 20 Again Pilate called out to them, because he wanted to release Jesus. 21 Then they began to yell, saying: \"To the stake with him! To the stake with him!\" 22 The third time he said to them: \"Why? What bad thing did this man do? I found in him nothing deserving of death; I will therefore punish him and release him.\" 23 At this they became insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be executed, and their voices prevailed. 24 So Pilate made the decision that their demand be met. 25 He released the man whom they were demanding, who had been thrown into prison for sedition and murder, but he surrendered Jesus to their will.\n26 Now as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the countryside, and they placed the torture stake on him to carry it behind Jesus. 27 A large number of people were following him, including women who kept beating themselves in grief and wailing for him. 28 Jesus turned to the women and said: \"Daughters of Jerusalem, stop weeping for me. Weep instead for yourselves and for your children; 29 for look! days are coming when people will say, 'Happy are the barren women, the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse!' 30 Then they will start saying to the mountains, 'Fall over us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us over!' 31 If they do these things when the tree is moist, what will occur when it is withered?\"\n32 Two other men, criminals, were also being led off to be executed with him. 33 And when they got to the place called Skull, they nailed him to the stake there alongside the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. 34 But Jesus was saying: \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\" Furthermore, they cast lots to distribute his garments. 35 And the people stood looking on. But the rulers were sneering and saying: \"Others he saved; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.\" 36 Even the soldiers mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine 37 and saying: \"If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.\" 38 There was also an inscription over him: \"This is the King of the Jews.\"\n39 Then one of the criminals hanging there began to speak abusively to him, saying: \"You are the Christ, are you not? Save yourself and us too!\" 40 In response the other rebuked him, saying: \"Do you not fear God at all, now that you have received the same judgment? 41 And we rightly so, for we are getting back what we deserve for the things we did; but this man did nothing wrong.\" 42 Then he said: \"Jesus, remember me when you get into your Kingdom.\" 43 And he said to him: \"Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.\"\n44 Well, by now it was about the sixth hour, and yet a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour, 45 because the sunlight failed; then the curtain of the sanctuary was torn down the middle. 46 And Jesus called out with a loud voice and said: \"Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.\" After he said this, he expired. 47 Because of seeing what occurred, the army officer began to glorify God, saying: \"Truly, this man was righteous.\" 48 And when all the crowds that were gathered together there for this spectacle saw the things that occurred, they returned home, beating their chests. 49 And all those acquainted with him were standing at a distance. Also, women who had accompanied him from Galilee were there and saw these things.\n50 And look! there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, who was a good and righteous man. 51 (This man had not voted in support of their scheme and action.) He was from Arimathea, a city of the Judeans, and was waiting for the Kingdom of God. 52 This man went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53 And he took it down and wrapped it up in fine linen, and he laid it in a tomb carved in the rock, where no man had yet lain. 54 Now it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin. 55 But the women who had come with him from Galilee followed along and took a look at the tomb and saw how his body was laid, 56 and they went back to prepare spices and perfumed oils. But, of course, they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.\nChapter 24\n1 But on the first day of the week, they came very early to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared. 2 But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3 and when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 While they were perplexed about this, look! two men in shining garments stood by them. 5 The women became frightened and kept their faces turned toward the ground, so the men said to them: \"Why are you looking for the living one among the dead? 6 He is not here, but has been raised up. Recall how he spoke to you while he was yet in Galilee, 7 saying that the Son of man must be handed over to sinful men and be executed on the stake and on the third day rise.\" 8 Then they remembered his words, 9 and they returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the rest. 10 They were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. Also, the rest of the women with them were telling these things to the apostles. 11 However, these sayings seemed like nonsense to them, and they would not believe the women.\n12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, and stooping forward, he saw only the linen cloths. So he went off, wondering to himself what had occurred.\n13 But look! on that very day, two of them were traveling to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 14 and they were conversing with each other about all these things that had happened.\n15 Now as they were conversing and discussing these things, Jesus himself approached and began walking with them, 16 but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 17 He said to them: \"What are these matters that you are debating between yourselves as you walk along?\" And they stood still, looking sad. 18 In answer the one named Cleopas said to him: \"Are you a stranger dwelling alone in Jerusalem and do not know the things that have occurred there during these days?\" 19 He asked them: \"What things?\" They said to him: \"The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people; 20 and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they nailed him to the stake. 21 But we were hoping that this man was the one who was going to deliver Israel. Yes, and besides all these things, this is the third day since these things occurred. 22 Moreover, some women from among us also astonished us, for they went early to the tomb 23 and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a supernatural sight of angels, who said he is alive. 24 Then some of those who were with us went off to the tomb, and they found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.\"\n25 So he said to them: \"O senseless ones and slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?\" 27 And starting with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.\n28 Finally they got close to the village to which they were traveling, and he made as if to travel on farther. 29 But they urged him to remain, saying: \"Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is nearly over.\" With that he went in to stay with them. 30 And as he was dining with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and began handing it to them. 31 At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him; but he disappeared from them. 32 And they said to each other: \"Were not our hearts burning within us as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?\" 33 And they got up in that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the Eleven and those assembled together with them, 34 who said: \"For a fact the Lord was raised up, and he appeared to Simon!\" 35 Then they related the events on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the bread.\n36 While they were speaking of these things, he himself stood in their midst and said to them: \"May you have peace.\" 37 But because they were terrified and frightened, they imagined that they were seeing a spirit. 38 So he said to them: \"Why are you troubled, and why have doubts come up in your hearts? 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones just as you see that I have.\" 40 And as he said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 But while they were still not believing for sheer joy and amazement, he said to them: \"Do you have something there to eat?\" 42 So they handed him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it before their eyes.\n44 He then said to them: \"These are my words that I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things written about me in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms must be fulfilled.\" 45 Then he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures, 46 and he said to them, \"This is what is written: that the Christ would suffer and rise from among the dead on the third day, 47 and on the basis of his name, repentance for forgiveness of sins would be preached in all the nations-starting out from Jerusalem. 48 You are to be witnesses of these things. 49 And look! I am sending upon you what my Father promised. You, though, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.\"\n50 Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 51 As he was blessing them, he was parted from them and taken up to heaven. 52 And they did obeisance to him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 53 And they were continually in the temple, praising God. \n",

    "text": "Galatians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, an apostle, neither from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him up from the dead, 2 and all the brothers with me, to the congregations of Galatia:\n3 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 4 He gave himself for our sins so that he might rescue us from the present wicked system of things according to the will of our God and Father, 5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\n6 I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from the One who called you with Christ's undeserved kindness to another sort of good news. 7 Not that there is another good news; but there are certain ones who are causing you trouble and wanting to distort the good news about the Christ. 8 However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond the good news we declared to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, I now say again, Whoever is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted, let him be accursed.\n10 Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be Christ's slave. 11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the good news I declared to you is not of human origin; 12 for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through a revelation by Jesus Christ.\n13 Of course, you heard about my conduct formerly in Judaism, that I kept intensely persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it; 14 and I was making greater progress in Judaism than many of my own age in my nation, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 15 But when God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through his undeserved kindness, thought good 16 to reveal his Son through me so that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, I did not immediately consult with any human; 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was, but I went to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus.\n18 Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I stayed with him for 15 days. 19 But I did not see any of the other apostles, only James the brother of the Lord. 20 Now regarding the things I am writing you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.\n21 After that I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 22 But I was personally unknown to the congregations of Judea that were in union with Christ. 23 They only used to hear: \"The man who formerly persecuted us is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated.\" 24 So they began glorifying God because of me.\nChapter 2\n1 Then after 14 years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, also taking Titus along with me. 2 I went up as a result of a revelation, and I presented to them the good news that I am preaching among the nations. This was done privately, however, before the men who were highly regarded, to make sure that I was not running or had not run in vain. 3 Nevertheless, not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek. 4 But that matter came up because of the false brothers brought in quietly, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we enjoy in union with Christ Jesus, so that they might completely enslave us; 5 we did not yield in submission to them, no, not for a moment, so that the truth of the good news might continue with you.\n6 But regarding those who seemed to be important-whatever they were makes no difference to me, for God does not go by a man's outward appearance-those highly regarded men imparted nothing new to me. 7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for those who are uncircumcised, just as Peter had been for those who are circumcised- 8 for the one who empowered Peter for an apostleship to those who are circumcised also empowered me for those who are of the nations- 9 and when they recognized the undeserved kindness that was given me, James and Cephas and John, the ones who seemed to be pillars, gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the nations but they to those who are circumcised. 10 They asked only that we keep the poor in mind, and this I have also earnestly endeavored to do.\n11 However, when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him face-to-face, because he was clearly in the wrong. 12 For before certain men from James arrived, he used to eat with people of the nations; but when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcised class. 13 The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense, so that even Barnabas was led along with them in their pretense. 14 But when I saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all: \"If you, though you are a Jew, live as the nations do and not as Jews do, how can you compel people of the nations to live according to Jewish practice?\"\n15 We who are Jews by birth, and not sinners from the nations, 16 recognize that a man is declared righteous, not by works of law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. So we have put our faith in Christ Jesus, so that we may be declared righteous by faith in Christ and not by works of law, for no one will be declared righteous by works of law. 17 Now if we have also been found sinners while seeking to be declared righteous by means of Christ, is Christ then sin's minister? Certainly not! 18 If the very things that I once tore down I build up again, I demonstrate that I am a transgressor. 19 For through law I died toward law, so that I might become alive toward God. 20 I am nailed to the stake along with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who is living in union with me. Indeed, the life that I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and handed himself over for me. 21 I do not reject the undeserved kindness of God, for if righteousness is through law, Christ actually died for nothing.\nChapter 3\n1 O senseless Galatians! Who has brought you under this evil influence, you who had Jesus Christ openly portrayed before you as nailed to the stake? 2 This one thing I want to ask you: Did you receive the spirit through works of law or because of faith in what you heard? 3 Are you so senseless? After starting on a spiritual course, are you finishing on a fleshly course? 4 Did you undergo so many sufferings for nothing? If it really was for nothing. 5 Therefore, does the one who supplies you the spirit and performs powerful works among you do it because of your works of law or because of your faith in what you heard? 6 Just as Abraham \"put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.\"\n7 Surely you know that it is those who adhere to faith who are sons of Abraham. 8 Now the scripture, foreseeing that God would declare people of the nations righteous through faith, declared the good news beforehand to Abraham, namely: \"By means of you all the nations will be blessed.\" 9 So those who adhere to faith are being blessed together with Abraham, who had faith.\n10 All those who depend on works of law are under a curse, for it is written: \"Cursed is everyone who does not remain in all the things written in the scroll of the Law by doing them.\" 11 Moreover, it is evident that by law no one is declared righteous with God, because \"the righteous one will live by reason of faith.\" 12 Now the Law is not based on faith. Rather, \"anyone who does these things will live by means of them.\" 13 Christ purchased us, releasing us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us, because it is written: \"Accursed is every man hung upon a stake.\" 14 This was so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the nations by means of Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith.\n15 Brothers, I speak using a human illustration: Once a covenant is validated, even if only by a man, no one annuls it or attaches additions to it. 16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, \"and to your descendants,\" in the sense of many. Rather, it says, \"and to your offspring,\" in the sense of one, who is Christ. 17 Further, I say this: The Law, which came into being 430 years later, does not invalidate the covenant previously made by God, so as to abolish the promise. 18 For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God has kindly given it to Abraham through a promise.\n19 Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, until the offspring should arrive to whom the promise had been made; and it was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator. 20 Now there is no mediator when just one person is involved, but God is only one. 21 Is the Law, therefore, against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, righteousness would actually have been by means of law. 22 But the Scripture handed all things over to the custody of sin, so that the promise resulting from faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those exercising faith.\n23 However, before the faith arrived, we were being guarded under law, being handed over into custody, looking to the faith that was about to be revealed. 24 So the Law became our guardian leading to Christ, so that we might be declared righteous through faith. 25 But now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a guardian.\n26 You are all, in fact, sons of God through your faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in union with Christ Jesus. 29 Moreover, if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham's offspring, heirs with reference to a promise.\nChapter 4\n1 Now I say that as long as the heir is a young child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the lord of all things, 2 but he is under supervisors and stewards until the day set ahead of time by his father. 3 Likewise, we too, when we were children, were enslaved by the elementary things of the world. 4 But when the full limit of the time arrived, God sent his Son, who was born of a woman and who was under law, 5 that he might release by purchase those under law, so that we might receive the adoption as sons.\n6 Now because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, and it cries out: \"Abba, Father!\" 7 So you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, then you are also an heir through God.\n8 Nevertheless, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who are not really gods. 9 But now that you have come to know God or, rather, have come to be known by God, how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again? 10 You are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years. 11 I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.\n12 Brothers, I beg you, become as I am, because I also used to be as you are. You did me no wrong. 13 But you know that it was because of a physical illness that I had my first opportunity to declare the good news to you. 14 And though my physical condition was a trial for you, you did not treat me with contempt or disgust; but you received me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus. 15 Where is that happiness you had? For I bear you witness that, if it had been possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me. 16 So, then, have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth? 17 They are zealous to win you over, but not for a good purpose; they want to alienate you from me, so that you may be eager to follow them. 18 However, it is always fine for someone to seek zealously after you for a good purpose and not just when I am present with you, 19 my little children, for whom I am again experiencing birth pains until Christ is formed in you. 20 I wish I could be present with you just now and speak in a different way, because I am perplexed over you.\n21 Tell me, you who want to be under law, Do you not hear the Law? 22 For example, it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant girl and one by the free woman; 23 but the one by the servant girl was actually born through natural descent and the other by the free woman through a promise. 24 These things may be taken as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which bears children for slavery and which is Hagar. 25 Now Hagar means Sinai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.\n27 For it is written: \"Be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break into joyful shouting, you woman who does not have birth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband.\" 28 Now you, brothers, are children of the promise the same as Isaac was. 29 But just as then the one born through natural descent began persecuting the one born through spirit, so also now. 30 Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? \"Drive out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will by no means be an heir with the son of the free woman.\" 31 So, brothers, we are children, not of a servant girl, but of the free woman.\nChapter 5\n1 For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore, stand firm, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.\n2 See! I, Paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you. 3 Again I bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law. 4 You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law; you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness. 5 For our part, we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith. 6 For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value, but faith operating through love is.\n7 You were running well. Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth? 8 This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you. 9 A little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough. 10 I am confident that you who are in union with the Lord will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing you trouble, whoever he may be, will receive the judgment he deserves. 11 As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the torture stake has been eliminated. 12 I wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves.\n13 You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires, but through love slave for one another. 14 For the entire Law has been fulfilled in one commandment, namely: \"You must love your neighbor as yourself.\" 15 If, though, you keep on biting and devouring one another, look out that you do not get annihilated by one another.\n16 But I say, Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all. 17 For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do the very things you want to do. 18 Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law.\n19 Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct, 20 idolatry, spiritism, hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects, 21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these. I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God's Kingdom.\n22 On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 23 mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24 Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires.\n25 If we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit. 26 Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.\nChapter 6\n1 Brothers, even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness. But keep an eye on yourself, for fear you too may be tempted. 2 Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and in this way you will fulfill the law of the Christ. 3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving himself. 4 But let each one examine his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person. 5 For each one will carry his own load.\n6 Moreover, let anyone who is being taught the word share in all good things with the one who gives such teaching.\n7 Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap; 8 because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit. 9 So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out. 10 So, then, as long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.\n11 See with what large letters I have written you with my own hand.\n12 All those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are the ones who try to compel you to get circumcised, doing so only to avoid being persecuted for the torture stake of the Christ. 13 For even those who are getting circumcised do not keep the Law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they may have cause for boasting about your flesh. 14 But may I never boast, except in the torture stake of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been put to death with regard to me and I with regard to the world. 15 For neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision, but a new creation is. 16 As for all those who walk orderly by this rule of conduct, peace and mercy be upon them, yes, upon the Israel of God.\n17 From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I am bearing on my body the brand marks of a slave of Jesus.\n18 The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show, brothers. Amen. \n",

    "text": "Ephesians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God's will, to the holy ones who are in Ephesus and are faithful in union with Christ Jesus:\n2 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n3 Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in union with Christ, 4 as he chose us to be in union with him before the founding of the world, that we should be holy and unblemished before him in love. 5 For he foreordained us to be adopted as his own sons through Jesus Christ, according to his good pleasure and will, 6 in praise of his glorious undeserved kindness that he kindly bestowed on us by means of his beloved one. 7 By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his undeserved kindness.\n8 This undeserved kindness he caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding 9 by making known to us the sacred secret of his will. It is according to his good pleasure that he himself purposed 10 for an administration at the full limit of the appointed times, to gather all things together in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. Yes, in him 11 with whom we are in union and were assigned as heirs, having been foreordained according to the purpose of the one who accomplishes all things as he decides according to his will, 12 so that we who have been first to hope in the Christ should serve for the praise of his glory. 13 But you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth, the good news about your salvation. After you believed, you were sealed by means of him with the promised holy spirit, 14 which is a token in advance of our inheritance, for the purpose of releasing God's own possession by a ransom, to his glorious praise.\n15 That is why I also, since I have heard of the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and the love that you demonstrate toward all the holy ones, 16 never stop giving thanks for you. I continue mentioning you in my prayers, 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the accurate knowledge of him. 18 He has enlightened the eyes of your heart, so that you may know to what hope he called you, what glorious riches he holds as an inheritance for the holy ones, 19 and how surpassing the greatness of his power is toward us believers. It is according to the operation of the mightiness of his strength, 20 which he exercised toward Christ when he raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named, not only in this system of things but also in that to come. 22 He also subjected all things under his feet and made him head over all things with regard to the congregation, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills up all things in all.\nChapter 2\n1 Furthermore, God made you alive, though you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2 in which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. 3 Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, carrying out the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and we were naturally children of wrath just as the rest. 4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, 5 made us alive together with the Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses-by undeserved kindness you have been saved. 6 Moreover, he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly places in union with Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming systems of things he might demonstrate the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness in his graciousness toward us in union with Christ Jesus.\n8 By this undeserved kindness you have been saved through faith, and this is not of your own doing; rather, it is God's gift. 9 No, it is not a result of works, so that no one should have grounds for boasting. 10 We are God's handiwork and were created in union with Christ Jesus for good works, which God determined in advance for us to walk in them.\n11 Therefore, remember that at one time you, people of the nations by fleshly descent, were the ones called \"uncircumcision\" by those called \"circumcision,\" which is made in the flesh by human hands. 12 At that time you were without Christ, alienated from the state of Israel, strangers to the covenants of the promise; you had no hope and were without God in the world. 13 But now in union with Christ Jesus, you who were once far off have come to be near by the blood of the Christ. 14 For he is our peace, the one who made the two groups one and destroyed the wall in between that fenced them off. 15 By means of his flesh he abolished the enmity, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees, in order to make the two groups in union with himself into one new man and to make peace, 16 and to reconcile fully both peoples in one body to God through the torture stake, because he had killed off the enmity by means of himself. 17 And he came and declared the good news of peace to you who were far off, and peace to those near, 18 because through him we, both peoples, have free access to the Father by one spirit.\n19 So you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens of the holy ones and are members of the household of God, 20 and you have been built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, while Christ Jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone. 21 In union with him the whole building, being harmoniously joined together, is growing into a holy temple for Jehovah. 22 In union with him you too are being built up together into a place for God to inhabit by spirit.\nChapter 3\n1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you, the people of the nations- 2 if, really, you have heard about the stewardship of God's undeserved kindness that was given to me for your sakes, 3 that by way of a revelation the sacred secret was made known to me, just as I wrote previously in brief. 4 So when you read this, you can realize my comprehension of the sacred secret of the Christ. 5 In other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit, 6 namely, that people of the nations should, in union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, be joint heirs and fellow members of the body and partakers with us of the promise. 7 I became a minister of this according to the free gift of God's undeserved kindness that was given me through the operation of his power.\n8 To me, a man less than the least of all holy ones, this undeserved kindness was given, so that I should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the Christ 9 and should make everyone see the administration of the sacred secret that has been hidden through the ages in God, who created all things. 10 This was so that now, through the congregation, there might be made known to the governments and the authorities in the heavenly places the greatly diversified wisdom of God. 11 This is according to the eternal purpose that he formed in connection with the Christ, Jesus our Lord, 12 by means of whom we have this freeness of speech and free access with confidence through our faith in him. 13 So I ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations in your behalf, for these mean glory for you.\n14 For this reason I bend my knees to the Father, 15 to whom every family in heaven and on earth owes its name. 16 I pray that he may grant you through the abundance of his glory to be made mighty in the man you are inside, with power through his spirit, 17 and that through your faith you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love. May you be rooted and established on the foundation, 18 in order that with all the holy ones you may be thoroughly able to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to know the love of the Christ, which surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness that God gives.\n20 Now to the one who can, according to his power that is operating in us, do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive, 21 to him be the glory by means of the congregation and by means of Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.\nChapter 4\n1 Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, 2 with all humility and mildness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, 3 earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace. 4 One body there is, and one spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling; 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.\n7 Now undeserved kindness was given to each one of us according to how the Christ measured out the free gift. 8 For it says: \"When he ascended on high he carried away captives; he gave gifts in men.\" 9 Now what does the expression \"he ascended\" mean but that he also descended into the lower regions, that is, the earth? 10 The very one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might give fullness to all things.\n11 And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, 12 with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones, for ministerial work, to build up the body of the Christ, 13 until we all attain to the oneness of the faith and of the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to being a full-grown man, attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ. 14 So we should no longer be children, tossed about as by waves and carried here and there by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men, by means of cunning in deceptive schemes. 15 But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ. 16 From him all the body is harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed. When each respective member functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.\n17 So this is what I say and bear witness to in the Lord, that you should no longer go on walking just as the nations also walk, in the futility of their minds. 18 They are in darkness mentally and alienated from the life that belongs to God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the insensitivity of their hearts. 19 Having gone past all moral sense, they gave themselves over to brazen conduct to practice every sort of uncleanness with greediness.\n20 But you did not learn the Christ to be like this, 21 if, indeed, you heard him and were taught by means of him, just as truth is in Jesus. 22 You were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires. 23 And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude, 24 and should put on the new personality that was created according to God's will in true righteousness and loyalty.\n25 Therefore, now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, because we are members belonging to one another. 26 Be wrathful, but do not sin; do not let the sun set while you are still angry; 27 do not give the Devil an opportunity. 28 Let the one who steals steal no more; rather, let him do hard work, doing good work with his hands, so that he may have something to share with someone in need. 29 Let a rotten word not come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building up as the need may be, to impart what is beneficial to the hearers. 30 Also, do not be grieving God's holy spirit, with which you have been sealed for a day of releasing by ransom.\n31 Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech, as well as everything injurious. 32 But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.\nChapter 5\n1 Therefore, become imitators of God, as beloved children, 2 and go on walking in love, just as the Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice, a sweet fragrance to God.\n3 Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as is proper for holy people; 4 neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting-things that are not befitting-but rather the giving of thanks. 5 For you know this, recognizing it for yourselves, that no sexually immoral person or unclean person or greedy person, which means being an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of the Christ and of God.\n6 Let no man deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience. 7 Therefore, do not be sharers with them; 8 for you were once darkness, but you are now light in connection with the Lord. Go on walking as children of light, 9 for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth. 10 Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord; 11 and stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness; rather, expose them for what they are. 12 For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention. 13 Now all the things that are being exposed are made evident by the light, for everything that is being made evident is light. 14 Therefore, it is said: \"Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and the Christ will shine upon you.\"\n15 So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, 16 making the best use of your time, because the days are wicked. 17 On this account stop being unreasonable, but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is. 18 Also, do not get drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery, but keep getting filled with spirit. 19 Speak to one another with psalms, praises to God, and spiritual songs, singing and accompanying yourselves with music in your hearts to Jehovah, 20 always giving thanks to our God and Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n21 Be in subjection to one another in fear of Christ. 22 Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord, 23 because a husband is head of his wife just as the Christ is head of the congregation, he being a savior of this body. 24 In fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the Christ, wives should also be to their husbands in everything. 25 Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it, 26 in order that he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word, 27 so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things, but holy and without blemish.\n28 In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself, 29 for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cherishes it, just as the Christ does the congregation, 30 because we are members of his body. 31 \"For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh.\" 32 This sacred secret is great. Now I am speaking about Christ and the congregation. 33 Nevertheless, each one of you must love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.\nChapter 6\n1 Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous. 2 \"Honor your father and your mother\" is the first command with a promise: 3 \"That it may go well with you and you may remain a long time on the earth.\" 4 And fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.\n5 Slaves, be obedient to your human masters, with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your hearts, as to the Christ, 6 not only when being watched, just to please men, but as Christ's slaves doing the will of God whole-souled. 7 Slave with a good attitude, as to Jehovah and not to men, 8 for you know that whatever good each one does, he will receive this back from Jehovah, whether he is a slave or a freeman. 9 Also, you masters, keep treating them in the same way, not threatening, for you know that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no partiality with him.\n10 Finally, go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength. 11 Put on the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil; 12 because we have a struggle, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places. 13 For this reason take up the complete suit of armor from God, so that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after you have accomplished everything, to stand firm.\n14 Stand firm, therefore, with the belt of truth fastened around your waist, wearing the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having your feet shod in readiness to declare the good news of peace. 16 Besides all of this, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one's burning arrows. 17 Also, accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God's word, 18 while with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit. And to that end stay awake, constantly making supplication in behalf of all the holy ones. 19 Pray also for me, that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth, so that I may be able to speak boldly in making known the sacred secret of the good news, 20 for which I am acting as an ambassador in chains, and that I may speak about it with boldness, as I ought to speak.\n21 Now so that you may also know about me and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. 22 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts.\n23 May the brothers have peace and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24 May the undeserved kindness be with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptness. \n",

    "text": "Philippians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in union with Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, along with overseers and ministerial servants:\n2 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n3 I thank my God always when I remember you 4 in every supplication of mine for all of you. I offer each supplication with joy, 5 because of the contribution you have made to the good news from the first day until this moment. 6 For I am confident of this very thing, that the one who started a good work in you will bring it to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. 7 It is only right for me to think this regarding all of you, since I have you in my heart, you who are sharers with me in the undeserved kindness both in my prison bonds and in the defending and legally establishing of the good news.\n8 For God is my witness of how I am longing for all of you with such tender affection as Christ Jesus has. 9 And this is what I continue praying, that your love may abound still more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment; 10 that you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ; 11 and that you may be filled with righteous fruit, which is through Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.\n12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that my situation has actually turned out for the advancement of the good news, 13 so that my prison bonds for the sake of Christ have become public knowledge among all the Praetorian Guard and all the rest. 14 Now most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence because of my prison bonds, and they are showing all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.\n15 True, some are preaching the Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 16 The latter are proclaiming the Christ out of love, for they know that I have been appointed to defend the good news; 17 but the former do it out of contentiousness, not with a pure motive, for they are intending to create trouble for me in my prison bonds. 18 With what result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and I rejoice over this. In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing, 19 for I know that this will result in my salvation through your supplication and with the support of the spirit of Jesus Christ. 20 This is in harmony with my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in any respect, but that with all freeness of speech Christ will now, as always before, be magnified by means of my body, whether through life or through death.\n21 For in my case, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 22 Now if I am to live on in the flesh, this is a fruitage of my work; yet what I would choose, I do not make known. 23 I am torn between these two things, for I do desire the releasing and the being with Christ, which is, to be sure, far better. 24 However, it is more necessary for me to remain in the flesh for your sakes. 25 So, being confident of this, I know I will remain and continue with all of you for your advancement and your joy in the faith, 26 so that your exultation may overflow in Christ Jesus because of me when I am again present with you.\n27 Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ, so that whether I come and see you or I am absent, I may hear about you and learn that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul, striving side by side for the faith of the good news, 28 and in no way being frightened by your opponents. This very thing is a proof of destruction for them, but of salvation for you; and this is from God. 29 For you have been given the privilege in behalf of Christ, not only to put your faith in him but also to suffer in his behalf. 30 For you are facing the same struggle that you saw me face, which you now hear that I am still facing.\nChapter 2\n1 If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any spiritual fellowship, if any tender affection and compassion, 2 make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united, having the one thought in mind. 3 Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you, 4 as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.\n5 Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus, 6 who, although he was existing in God's form, did not even consider the idea of trying to be equal to God. 7 No, but he emptied himself and took a slave's form and became human. 8 More than that, when he came as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death, yes, death on a torture stake. 9 For this very reason, God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, 10 so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend-of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground- 11 and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.\n12 Consequently, my beloved ones, just as you have always obeyed, not only during my presence but now much more readily during my absence, keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 13 For God is the one who for the sake of his good pleasure energizes you, giving you both the desire and the power to act. 14 Keep doing all things free from murmuring and arguments, 15 so that you may come to be blameless and innocent, children of God without a blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you are shining as illuminators in the world, 16 keeping a tight grip on the word of life. Then I may have reason for rejoicing in Christ's day, knowing that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain. 17 However, even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and the holy service to which your faith has led you, I am glad and I rejoice with all of you. 18 In the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me.\n19 Now I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I may be encouraged when I receive news about you. 20 For I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for your concerns. 21 For all the others are seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 22 But you know the proof he gave of himself, that like a child with a father he slaved with me to advance the good news. 23 Therefore, he is the one I am hoping to send just as soon as I see how things turn out for me. 24 Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.\n25 But for now I consider it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your envoy and personal servant for my need, 26 since he is longing to see all of you and is depressed because you heard he had fallen sick. 27 Indeed, he did fall sick nearly to the point of death; but God had mercy on him, in fact, not only on him but also on me, so that I should not have one grief after another. 28 Therefore, I am sending him with the greatest urgency, so that when you see him you may again rejoice and I may also be less anxious. 29 So give him the customary welcome in the Lord with all joy, and keep holding men of that sort dear, 30 because he nearly died on account of the work of Christ, risking his life in order to make up for your not being here to render personal service to me.\nChapter 3\n1 Finally, my brothers, continue rejoicing in the Lord. It is not troublesome for me to write the same things to you, and it is for your safety.\n2 Look out for the dogs; look out for those who cause injury; look out for those who mutilate the flesh. 3 For we are those with the real circumcision, we who are rendering sacred service by God's spirit and boasting in Christ Jesus and who do not base our confidence in the flesh, 4 though I, if anyone, do have grounds for confidence in the flesh.\nIf any other man thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 5 circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born from Hebrews; regarding law, a Pharisee; 6 regarding zeal, persecuting the congregation; regarding righteousness based on law, one who proved himself blameless. 7 Yet, the things that were gains to me, I have considered loss on account of the Christ. 8 What is more, I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in union with him, not because of my own righteousness from following the Law, but because of the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. 10 My aim is to know him and the power of his resurrection and to share in his sufferings, submitting myself to a death like his, 11 to see if at all possible I may attain to the earlier resurrection from the dead.\n12 Not that I have already received it or am already made perfect, but I am pressing on to see if I may also lay hold on that for which Christ Jesus selected me. 13 Brothers, I do not yet consider myself as having taken hold of it; but one thing is certain: Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, 14 I am pressing on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus. 15 Therefore, let those of us who are mature be of this mental attitude, and if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above attitude to you. 16 At any rate, to the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same course.\n17 Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers, and keep your eye on those who are walking in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you. 18 For there are many-I used to mention them often but now I mention them also with weeping-who are walking as enemies of the torture stake of the Christ. 19 Their end is destruction, and their god is their belly, and their glory is really their shame, and they have their minds on earthly things. 20 But our citizenship exists in the heavens, and we are eagerly waiting for a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our humble body to be like his glorious body by his great power that enables him to subject all things to himself.\nChapter 4\n1 Consequently, my brothers whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in this way in the Lord, my beloved ones.\n2 I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. 3 Yes, I request you also, as a true fellow worker, to keep assisting these women who have striven side by side with me for the good news, along with Clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.\n4 Always rejoice in the Lord. Again I will say, Rejoice! 5 Let your reasonableness become known to all men. The Lord is near. 6 Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God; 7 and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.\n8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well-spoken-of, whatever things are virtuous, and whatever things are praiseworthy, continue considering these things. 9 The things that you learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me, practice these, and the God of peace will be with you.\n10 I rejoice greatly in the Lord that now at last you have renewed your concern for me. Though you were concerned about me, you lacked opportunity to show it. 11 Not that I am saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be self-sufficient regardless of my circumstances. 12 I know how to be low on provisions and how to have an abundance. In everything and in all circumstances I have learned the secret of both how to be full and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance and how to do without. 13 For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.\n14 Nevertheless, you did well to share with me in my tribulation. 15 In fact, you Philippians also know that after you first learned the good news, when I departed from Macedonia, not a congregation shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone; 16 for while I was in Thessalonica, you sent something to me for my need not just once but twice. 17 Not that I am looking for a gift, but I want the fruitage that brings more credit to your account. 18 However, I have everything I need and even more. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent, a sweet fragrance, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God. 19 In turn my God will fully supply all your need according to his riches in glory by means of Christ Jesus. 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\n21 Give my greetings to every holy one in union with Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their greetings. 22 All the holy ones, but especially those of the household of Caesar, send you their greetings.\n23 The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit you show. \n",

    "text": "First Thessalonians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:\nMay you have undeserved kindness and peace.\n2 We always thank God when we mention all of you in our prayers, 3 for we continually remember your faithful work, your loving labor, and your endurance because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father. 4 For we know, brothers loved by God, his choosing of you, 5 because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and with strong conviction, just as you know what sort of men we became among you for your sakes. 6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, seeing that you accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit, 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.\n8 The fact is, not only has the word of Jehovah sounded out from you in Macedonia and Achaia but your faith in God has spread abroad in every place, so that we do not need to say anything. 9 For they themselves keep reporting about our first contact with you and how you turned to God from your idols to slave for a living and true God, 10 and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised up from the dead, namely, Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.\nChapter 2\n1 You yourselves surely know, brothers, that our visit to you has not been without results. 2 For although we had first suffered and been insolently treated in Philippi, as you know, we mustered up boldness by means of our God to tell you the good news of God in the face of much opposition. 3 For the exhortation we give does not spring from error or from uncleanness or with deceit, 4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak to please, not men, but God, who examines our hearts.\n5 In fact, you know that we never used flattering speech or put on any false front with greedy motives; God is witness! 6 Nor have we been seeking glory from men, either from you or from others, though we could be an expensive burden as apostles of Christ. 7 On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst, as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children. 8 So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you, not only the good news of God but also our very selves, because you became so beloved to us.\n9 Surely you remember, brothers, our labor and toil. We were working night and day, so that we would not put an expensive burden on any one of you, when we preached the good news of God to you. 10 You are witnesses, God is also, of how loyal and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers. 11 You well know that we kept exhorting and consoling you and bearing witness to each one of you, just as a father does his children, 12 so that you would go on walking worthily of God, who is calling you to his Kingdom and glory.\n13 Indeed, that is why we also thank God unceasingly, because when you received God's word, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in you believers. 14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the congregations of God in union with Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you suffered at the hands of your own countrymen the same things that they also are suffering at the hands of the Jews, 15 who even killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us. Furthermore, they are not pleasing God, but are against the interests of all men, 16 as they try to prevent us from speaking to people of the nations so that these might be saved. In this way they always fill up the measure of their sins. But his wrath has at last come upon them.\n17 But when we were separated from you, brothers, for just a short time (in person, not in our hearts), because of our strong desire, we made every effort to see you in person. 18 For this reason we wanted to come to you, yes I, Paul, tried not just once but twice; yet Satan cut across our path. 19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our Lord Jesus at his presence? Is it not in fact you? 20 You certainly are our glory and joy.\nChapter 3\n1 So when we could bear it no longer, we thought it best to stay on alone in Athens; 2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's minister in the good news about the Christ, to make you firm and comfort you regarding your faith, 3 so that no one might be shaken by these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we cannot avoid suffering such things. 4 For when we were with you, we used to tell you in advance that we would suffer tribulation, and that is what has happened, just as you know. 5 That is why, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to learn of your faithfulness, in case somehow the Tempter might have tempted you, and our labor might have turned out to be in vain.\n6 But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has given us the good news about your faithfulness and love, that you always continue to remember us fondly and that you long to see us in the same way as we also do you. 7 That is why, brothers, in all our distress and tribulation, we have been comforted because of you and the faithfulness you demonstrate. 8 Because we are revitalized if you are standing firm in the Lord. 9 For how can we show our thanks to God concerning you in return for the great joy we feel before our God on your account? 10 Night and day we make supplications as earnestly as we can to see you in person and to supply what is lacking in your faith.\n11 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus make a way for us to come to you. 12 Moreover, may the Lord cause you to increase, yes, to abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you, 13 so that he may make your hearts firm, blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the presence of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.\nChapter 4\n1 Finally, brothers, just as you received instruction from us on how you should walk in order to please God, just as you are in fact walking, we request you and appeal to you by the Lord Jesus to keep doing it more fully. 2 For you know the instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.\n3 For this is the will of God, that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality. 4 Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, 5 not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion like the nations have that do not know God. 6 No one should go beyond proper limits and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because Jehovah exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told you previously and also strongly warned you. 7 For God has called us, not for uncleanness, but for holiness. 8 So, then, the man who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but God, who gives you his holy spirit.\n9 However, concerning brotherly love, you do not need us to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another. 10 In fact, you are doing so toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to go on doing so in fuller measure. 11 Make it your aim to live quietly and to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we instructed you, 12 so that you may walk decently in the eyes of people outside and not need anything.\n13 Moreover, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who are sleeping in death, so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope. 14 For if we have faith that Jesus died and rose again, so too God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death through Jesus. 15 For this is what we tell you by Jehovah's word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death; 16 because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel's voice and with God's trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first. 17 Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will always be with the Lord. 18 So keep comforting one another with these words.\nChapter 5\n1 Now as for the times and the seasons, brothers, you need nothing to be written to you. 2 For you yourselves know very well that Jehovah's day is coming exactly as a thief in the night. 3 Whenever it is that they are saying, \"Peace and security!\" then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them, just like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape. 4 But you, brothers, you are not in darkness, so that the day should overtake you as it would thieves, 5 for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We belong neither to night nor to darkness.\n6 So, then, let us not sleep on as the rest do, but let us stay awake and keep our senses. 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 8 But as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and put on the breastplate of faith and love and the hope of salvation as a helmet 9 because God assigned us, not to wrath, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 10 He died for us, so that whether we stay awake or are asleep, we should live together with him. 11 Therefore, keep encouraging one another and building one another up, just as you are in fact doing.\n12 Now we request you, brothers, to show respect for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you; 13 and to give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work. Be peaceable with one another. 14 On the other hand, we urge you, brothers, to warn the disorderly, speak consolingly to those who are depressed, support the weak, be patient toward all. 15 See that no one repays injury for injury to anyone, but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.\n16 Always be rejoicing. 17 Pray constantly. 18 Give thanks for everything. This is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 19 Do not put out the fire of the spirit. 20 Do not treat prophecies with contempt. 21 Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine. 22 Abstain from every form of wickedness.\n23 May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. And may the spirit and soul and body of you brothers, sound in every respect, be preserved blameless at the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 The one who is calling you is faithful, and he will surely do so.\n25 Brothers, keep praying for us.\n26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.\n27 I am putting you under the solemn obligation by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.\n28 The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. \n",

    "text": "Second Thessalonians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:\n2 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n3 We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you, brothers. This is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another. 4 As a result we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the hardships that you are suffering. 5 This is a proof of the righteous judgment of God, leading to your being counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you are indeed suffering.\n6 This takes into account that it is righteous on God's part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for you. 7 But you who suffer tribulation will be given relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels 8 in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance on those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. 9 These very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction from before the Lord and from the glory of his strength, 10 at the time when he comes to be glorified in connection with his holy ones and to be regarded in that day with wonder among all those who exercised faith, because the witness we gave met with faith among you.\n11 To that very end we always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling and with his power perform completely all the good that he pleases and every work of faith. 12 This is so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you in union with him, according to the undeserved kindness of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nChapter 2\n1 However, brothers, concerning the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you 2 not to be quickly shaken from your reason nor to be alarmed either by an inspired statement or by a spoken message or by a letter appearing to be from us, to the effect that the day of Jehovah is here.\n3 Let no one lead you astray in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed, the son of destruction. 4 He stands in opposition and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits down in the temple of God, publicly showing himself to be a god. 5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I used to tell you these things?\n6 And now you know what is acting as a restraint, so that he will be revealed in his own due time. 7 True, the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who is right now acting as a restraint is out of the way. 8 Then, indeed, the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will do away with by the spirit of his mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his presence. 9 But the lawless one's presence is by the operation of Satan with every powerful work and lying signs and wonders 10 and every unrighteous deception for those who are perishing, as a retribution because they did not accept the love of the truth in order that they might be saved. 11 That is why God lets a deceptive influence mislead them so that they may come to believe the lie, 12 in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.\n13 However, we are obligated always to thank God for you, brothers loved by Jehovah, because from the beginning God selected you for salvation by sanctifying you with his spirit and by your faith in the truth. 14 He called you to this through the good news we declare, so that you may acquire the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15 So, then, brothers, stand firm and maintain your hold on the traditions that you were taught, whether it was by a spoken message or by a letter from us. 16 Moreover, may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave everlasting comfort and good hope by means of undeserved kindness, 17 comfort your hearts and make you firm in every good deed and word.\nChapter 3\n1 Finally, brothers, carry on prayer for us, that the word of Jehovah may keep spreading rapidly and being glorified, just as it is with you, 2 and that we may be rescued from harmful and wicked men, for faith is not a possession of all people. 3 But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the wicked one. 4 Moreover, we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you are carrying out and will go on carrying out our instructions. 5 May the Lord continue to guide your hearts successfully to the love of God and to the endurance for the Christ.\n6 Now we are giving you instructions, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from every brother who is walking disorderly and not according to the tradition that you received from us. 7 For you yourselves know how you should imitate us, because we did not behave in a disorderly way among you, 8 nor did we eat anyone's food free. On the contrary, by labor and toil we were working night and day so as not to impose an expensive burden on any one of you. 9 Not that we do not have authority, but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate. 10 In fact, when we were with you, we used to give you this order: \"If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.\" 11 For we hear that some are walking disorderly among you, not working at all, but meddling with what does not concern them. 12 To such people we give the order and exhortation in the Lord Jesus Christ that they should work quietly and eat food they themselves earn.\n13 For your part, brothers, do not give up in doing good. 14 But if anyone is not obedient to our word through this letter, keep this one marked and stop associating with him, so that he may become ashamed. 15 And yet do not consider him an enemy, but continue admonishing him as a brother.\n16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace constantly in every way. May the Lord be with all of you.\n17 Here is my greeting, Paul's, in my own hand, which is a sign in every letter; this is the way I write.\n18 The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. \n",

    "text": "First Timothy\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus, our hope, 2 to Timothy, a genuine child in the faith:\nMay you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.\n3 Just as I encouraged you to stay in Ephesus when I was about to go to Macedonia, so I do now, in order for you to command certain ones not to teach different doctrine, 4 nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies. Such things end up in nothing useful but merely give rise to speculations rather than providing anything from God in connection with faith. 5 Really, the objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy. 6 By deviating from these things, some have been turned aside to meaningless talk. 7 They want to be teachers of law, but they do not understand either the things they are saying or the things they insist on so strongly.\n8 Now we know that the Law is fine if one applies it properly, 9 recognizing that law is made, not for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, ungodly and sinners, disloyal and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers, 10 sexually immoral people, men who practice homosexuality, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and everything else that is in opposition to the wholesome teaching 11 according to the glorious good news of the happy God, with which I was entrusted.\n12 I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry, 13 although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Nevertheless, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith. 14 But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus. 15 This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these, I am foremost. 16 Nevertheless, I was shown mercy so that by means of me as the foremost case, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his patience, making me an example to those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.\n17 Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.\n18 This instruction I entrust to you, my child Timothy, in harmony with the prophecies that were made about you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare, 19 holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside, resulting in the shipwreck of their faith. 20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are among these, and I have handed them over to Satan so that they may be taught by discipline not to blaspheme.\nChapter 2\n1 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made concerning all sorts of men, 2 concerning kings and all those who are in high positions, so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion and seriousness. 3 This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God, 4 whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth. 5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all-this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time. 7 For the purpose of this witness I was appointed a preacher and an apostle-I am telling the truth, I am not lying-a teacher of nations in the matter of faith and truth.\n8 So I desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands, without anger and debates. 9 Likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing, 10 but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God, namely, through good works.\n11 Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but she is to remain silent. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and became a transgressor. 15 However, she will be kept safe through childbearing, provided she continues in faith and love and holiness along with soundness of mind.\nChapter 3\n1 This statement is trustworthy: If a man is reaching out to be an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work. 2 The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach, 3 not a drunkard, not violent, but reasonable, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money, 4 a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having his children in subjection with all seriousness 5 (for if any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he care for the congregation of God?), 6 not a newly converted man, for fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed on the Devil. 7 Moreover, he should also have a fine testimony from outsiders so that he does not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil.\n8 Ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued, not indulging in a lot of wine, not greedy of dishonest gain, 9 holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience.\n10 Also, let these be tested as to fitness first; then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation.\n11 Women should likewise be serious, not slanderous, moderate in habits, faithful in all things.\n12 Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner over their children and their own households. 13 For the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.\n14 I am writing you these things, though I am hoping to come to you shortly, 15 but in case I am delayed, so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God's household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth. 16 Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: 'He was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, appeared to angels, was preached about among nations, was believed upon in the world, was received up in glory.'\nChapter 4\n1 However, the inspired word clearly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired statements and teachings of demons, 2 by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, whose conscience is seared as with a branding iron. 3 They forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods that God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth. 4 For every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 5 for it is sanctified through God's word and prayer over it.\n6 By giving this counsel to the brothers, you will be a fine minister of Christ Jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the fine teaching that you have followed closely. 7 But reject irreverent false stories, like those told by old women. On the other hand, train yourself with godly devotion as your aim. 8 For physical training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come. 9 That statement is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance. 10 This is why we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.\n11 Keep on giving these commands and teaching them. 12 Never let anyone look down on your youth. Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness. 13 Until I come, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching. 14 Do not neglect the gift in you that was given you through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you. 15 Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people. 16 Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.\nChapter 5\n1 Do not severely criticize an older man. On the contrary, appeal to him as a father, to younger men as brothers, 2 to older women as mothers, to younger women as sisters, with all chasteness.\n3 Give consideration to widows who are truly widows. 4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn first to practice godly devotion in their own household and to repay their parents and grandparents what is due them, for this is acceptable in God's sight. 5 Now the woman who is truly a widow and left destitute has put her hope in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. 6 But the one who gives herself to sensual gratification is dead though she is living. 7 So keep on giving these instructions, so that they may be irreprehensible. 8 Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.\n9 A widow is to be put on the list if she is not less than 60 years old, was the wife of one husband, 10 having a reputation for fine works, if she raised children, if she practiced hospitality, if she washed the feet of holy ones, if she assisted the afflicted, if she devoted herself to every good work.\n11 On the other hand, do not put younger widows on the list, for when their sexual desires come between them and the Christ, they want to marry. 12 And they will incur judgment because they have abandoned their first expression of faith. 13 At the same time they also learn to be unoccupied, going around from one house to another; yes, not only unoccupied but also gossipers and meddlers in other people's affairs, talking about things they should not. 14 Therefore, I desire the younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage a household, to give no opportunity to the opposer to criticize. 15 In fact, some have already been turned aside to follow Satan. 16 If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her assist them so that the congregation is not burdened. Then it can assist those who are truly widows.\n17 Let the elders who preside in a fine way be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching. 18 For the scripture says, \"You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain,\" also, \"The worker is worthy of his wages.\" 19 Do not accept an accusation against an older man except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 20 Reprove before all onlookers those who practice sin, as a warning to the rest. 21 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these instructions without any prejudice or partiality.\n22 Never lay your hands hastily on any man; neither become a sharer in the sins of others; keep yourself chaste.\n23 Do not drink water any longer, but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness.\n24 The sins of some men are publicly known, leading directly to judgment, but those of other men become evident later. 25 In the same way also, the fine works are publicly known and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hidden.\nChapter 6\n1 Let those who are under the yoke of slavery keep on considering their owners worthy of full honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may never be spoken of injuriously. 2 Moreover, let those having believing owners not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers. Rather, they should serve more readily, because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved.\nKeep on teaching these things and giving these exhortations. 3 If any man teaches another doctrine and does not agree with the wholesome instruction, which is from our Lord Jesus Christ, nor with the teaching that is in harmony with godly devotion, 4 he is puffed up with pride and does not understand anything. He is obsessed with arguments and debates about words. These things give rise to envy, strife, slander, wicked suspicions, 5 constant disputes about minor matters by men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain. 6 To be sure, there is great gain in godly devotion along with contentment. 7 For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. 8 So, having food and clothing, we will be content with these things.\n9 But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin. 10 For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.\n11 However, you, O man of God, flee from these things. But pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, and mildness. 12 Fight the fine fight of the faith; get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.\n13 Before God, who preserves all things alive, and Christ Jesus, who as a witness made the fine public declaration before Pontius Pilate, I give you orders 14 to observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which the happy and only Potentate will show in its own appointed times. He is the King of those who rule as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, 16 the one alone having immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal might. Amen.\n17 Instruct those who are rich in the present system of things not to be arrogant, and to place their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who richly provides us with all the things we enjoy. 18 Tell them to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be generous, ready to share, 19 safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, so that they may get a firm hold on the real life.\n20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called \"knowledge.\" 21 By making a show of such knowledge, some have deviated from the faith.\nMay the undeserved kindness be with you. \n",

    "text": "Second Timothy\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will according to the promise of the life that is through Christ Jesus, 2 to Timothy, a beloved child:\nMay you have undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.\n3 I am grateful to God, to whom I am rendering sacred service as my forefathers did, and with a clean conscience, never ceasing to remember you in my supplications night and day. 4 As I remember your tears, I am longing to see you, so that I may get filled with joy. 5 For I recall your unhypocritical faith, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, but which I am confident is also in you.\n6 For this reason I remind you to stir up like a fire the gift of God that is in you through the laying of my hands on you. 7 For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but one of power and of love and of soundness of mind. 8 So do not become ashamed either of the witness about our Lord or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering adversity for the good news by relying on the power of God. 9 He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and undeserved kindness. This was given to us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long ago, 10 but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has shed light on life and incorruption through the good news, 11 for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.\n12 This is why I am also suffering these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know the One whom I have believed, and I am confident that he is able to guard what I have laid up in trust with him until that day. 13 Keep holding to the standard of wholesome words that you heard from me with the faith and love that result from union with Christ Jesus. 14 Guard this fine trust by means of the holy spirit, which is dwelling in us.\n15 You know this, that all the men in the province of Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains. 17 On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently looked for me and found me. 18 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from Jehovah in that day. And you well know all the services he rendered in Ephesus.\nChapter 2\n1 You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in Christ Jesus; 2 and the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses, these things entrust to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others. 3 As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus, take your part in suffering adversity. 4 No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier. 5 And even in the games, anyone who competes is not crowned unless he has competed according to the rules. 6 The hardworking farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits. 7 Give constant thought to what I am saying; the Lord will give you understanding in all things.\n8 Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up from the dead and was David's offspring, according to the good news I preach, 9 for which I am suffering and being imprisoned as a criminal. Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound. 10 For this reason I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is through Christ Jesus, along with everlasting glory. 11 This saying is trustworthy: Certainly if we died together, we will also live together; 12 if we go on enduring, we will also rule together as kings; if we deny, he will also deny us; 13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.\n14 Keep reminding them of these things, instructing them before God not to fight about words, something of no usefulness at all because it harms those listening. 15 Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright. 16 But reject empty speeches that violate what is holy, for they will lead to more and more ungodliness, 17 and their word will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them. 18 These men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are subverting the faith of some. 19 Despite that, the solid foundation of God remains standing, having this seal, \"Jehovah knows those who belong to him,\" and, \"Let everyone calling on the name of Jehovah renounce unrighteousness.\"\n20 Now in a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable use but others for a use lacking honor. 21 So if anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be an instrument for an honorable use, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work. 22 So flee from youthful desires, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart.\n23 Further, reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they produce fights. 24 For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, showing restraint when wronged, 25 instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth, 26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him to do his will.\nChapter 3\n1 But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3 having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, 4 betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, 5 having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. 6 From among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, 7 always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.\n8 Now in the way that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also go on opposing the truth. Such men are completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith. 9 Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their folly will be very plain to all, as it was with those two men. 10 But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, 11 the persecutions and sufferings such as I experienced in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra. I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all. 12 In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted. 13 But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.\n14 You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from whom you learned them 15 and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, 17 so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.\nChapter 4\n1 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his manifestation and his Kingdom: 2 Preach the word; be at it urgently in favorable times and difficult times; reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all patience and art of teaching. 3 For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching, but according to their own desires, they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled. 4 They will turn away from listening to the truth and give attention to false stories. 5 You, though, keep your senses in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my releasing is imminent. 7 I have fought the fine fight, I have run the race to the finish, I have observed the faith. 8 From this time on, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.\n9 Do your utmost to come to me shortly. 10 For Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things, and he has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark along with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry. 12 But I have sent Tychicus off to Ephesus. 13 When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.\n14 Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm. Jehovah will repay him according to his deeds. 15 You too should be on guard against him, for he opposed our message to an excessive degree.\n16 In my first defense no one came to my side, but they all forsook me-may they not be held accountable. 17 But the Lord stood near me and infused power into me, so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it; and I was rescued from the lion's mouth. 18 The Lord will rescue me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\n19 Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.\n20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus. 21 Do your utmost to arrive before winter.\nEubulus sends you his greetings, and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.\n22 The Lord be with the spirit you show. His undeserved kindness be with you. \n",

For this very reason, keep on reproving them with severity so that they may be healthy in the faith, 14 paying no attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 15 All things are clean to clean people; but to those who are defiled and faithless, nothing is clean, for both their minds and their consciences are defiled. 16 They publicly declare that they know God, but they disown him by their works, because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved for good work of any sort.\nChapter 2\n1 You, however, keep on speaking what is consistent with wholesome teaching. 2 Let the older men be moderate in habits, serious, sound in mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance. 3 Likewise, let the older women be reverent in behavior, not slanderous, not enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good, 4 so that they may advise the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 to be sound in mind, chaste, working at home, good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively.\n6 Likewise, keep on urging the younger men to be sound in mind, 7 showing yourself to be an example of fine works in every way. Teach what is pure with all seriousness, 8 using wholesome speech that cannot be criticized, so that those who oppose may be put to shame, having nothing negative to say about us. 9 Let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things, trying to please them, not talking back, 10 not stealing from them, but showing complete trustworthiness, so that in every way they may adorn the teaching of our Savior, God.\n11 For the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people. 12 It trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things, 13 while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of our Savior, Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to set us free from every sort of lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people who are his own special possession, zealous for fine works.\n15 Keep on speaking these things and exhorting and reproving with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you.\nChapter 3\n1 Continue reminding them to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities, to be ready for every good work, 2 to speak injuriously of no one, not to be quarrelsome, but to be reasonable, displaying all mildness toward all men. 3 For we too were once senseless, disobedient, led astray, being slaves to various desires and pleasures, carrying on in badness and envy, detestable, hating one another.\n4 However, when the kindness of our Savior, God, and his love for mankind were manifested 5 (not because of any righteous works we had done, but because of his own mercy), he saved us by means of the bath that brought us to life and by making us new by holy spirit. 6 He poured this spirit out richly on us through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that after being declared righteous through the undeserved kindness of that one, we might become heirs according to a hope of everlasting life.\n8 These words are trustworthy, and I want you to keep stressing these matters, so that those who have believed God may keep their minds focused on maintaining fine works. These things are fine and beneficial to men.\n9 But have nothing to do with foolish arguments and genealogies and disputes and fights over the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile. 10 As for a man who promotes a sect, reject him after a first and a second admonition, 11 knowing that such a man has deviated from the way and is sinning and is self-condemned.\n12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your utmost to come to me at Nicopolis, for that is where I have decided to spend the winter. 13 Carefully supply Zenas, who is versed in the Law, and Apollos so that they may lack nothing for their trip. 14 But let our people also learn to maintain fine works so as to help in cases of urgent need, so that they may not be unproductive.\n15 All those with me send you their greetings.

    "text": "James\nChapter 1\n1 James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the 12 tribes that are scattered about:\nGreetings!\n2 Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, 3 knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith produces endurance. 4 But let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.\n5 So if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him. 6 But let him keep asking in faith, not doubting at all, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about. 7 In fact, that man should not expect to receive anything from Jehovah; 8 he is an indecisive man, unsteady in all his ways.\n9 But let the lowly brother rejoice over his exaltation, 10 and the rich one over his humiliation, because like a flower of the field he will pass away. 11 For just as the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the plant, and its flower falls off and its outward beauty perishes, so too the rich man will fade away in the midst of his pursuits.\n12 Happy is the man who keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving Him. 13 When under trial, let no one say: \"I am being tried by God.\" For with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone. 14 But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. 15 Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.\n16 Do not be misled, my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the Father of the celestial lights, who does not vary or change like the shifting shadows. 18 It was his will to bring us forth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.\n19 Know this, my beloved brothers: Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger, 20 for man's anger does not bring about God's righteousness. 21 Therefore, put away all filthiness and every trace of badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word that is able to save you.\n22 However, become doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning. 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself, and he goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he is. 25 But the one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; and he will be happy in what he does.\n26 If any man thinks he is a worshipper of God but does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he is deceiving his own heart, and his worship is futile. 27 The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.\nChapter 2\n1 My brothers, you are not holding to the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ while showing favoritism, are you? 2 For if a man with gold rings on his fingers and in splendid clothing comes into your meeting, but a poor man in filthy clothing also enters, 3 do you look with favor on the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, \"You take this seat here in a fine place,\" and do you say to the poor one, \"You keep standing\" or, \"Take that seat there under my footstool\"? 4 If so, do you not have class distinctions among yourselves, and have you not become judges rendering wicked decisions?\n5 Listen, my beloved brothers. Did not God choose those who are poor from the world's standpoint to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom, which he promised to those who love him? 6 But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you before law courts? 7 Do they not blaspheme the fine name by which you were called? 8 If, now, you carry out the royal law according to the scripture, \"You must love your neighbor as yourself,\" you are doing quite well. 9 But if you continue showing favoritism, you are committing sin, and you are convicted by the law as transgressors.\n10 For if anyone obeys all the Law but makes a false step in one point, he has become an offender against all of it. 11 For the one who said, \"You must not commit adultery,\" also said, \"You must not murder.\" If, now, you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of law. 12 Keep on speaking and behaving in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people. 13 For the one who does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.\n14 Of what benefit is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but he does not have works? That faith cannot save him, can it? 15 If any brothers or sisters are lacking clothing and enough food for the day, 16 yet one of you says to them, \"Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,\" but you do not give them what they need for their body, of what benefit is it? 17 So, too, faith by itself, without works, is dead.\n18 Nevertheless, someone will say: \"You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\" 19 You believe that there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder. 20 But do you care to know, O empty man, that faith without works is useless? 21 Was not Abraham our father declared righteous by works after he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 22 You see that his faith was active along with his works and his faith was perfected by his works, 23 and the scripture was fulfilled that says: \"Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness,\" and he came to be called Jehovah's friend.\n24 You see that a man is to be declared righteous by works and not by faith alone. 25 In the same manner, was not Rahab the prostitute also declared righteous by works after she received the messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way? 26 Indeed, just as the body without spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.\nChapter 3\n1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment. 2 For we all stumble many times. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also his whole body. 3 If we put bridles in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide also their whole body. 4 Look also at ships: Although they are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go.\n5 So, too, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it makes great brags. See how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze! 6 The tongue is also a fire. The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members, for it defiles all the body and sets the whole course of life on fire, and it is set on fire by Gehenna. 7 For every kind of wild animal and bird and reptile and sea creature is to be tamed and has been tamed by humans. 8 But no human can tame the tongue. It is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison. 9 With it we praise Jehovah, the Father, and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence \"in the likeness of God.\" 10 Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing.\nMy brothers, it is not right for things to happen this way. 11 A spring does not cause the fresh water and the bitter water to bubble out of the same opening, does it? 12 My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, or a grapevine figs, can it? Neither can salt water produce fresh water.\n13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed with a mildness that comes from wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy and contentiousness in your hearts, do not be bragging and lying against the truth. 15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above; it is earthly, animalistic, demonic. 16 For wherever there are jealousy and contentiousness, there will also be disorder and every vile thing.\n17 But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, not hypocritical. 18 Moreover, the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions for those who are making peace.\nChapter 4\n1 What is the source of the wars and fights among you? Do they not originate from your fleshly desires that carry on a conflict within you? 2 You desire, and yet you do not have. You go on murdering and coveting, and yet you are not able to obtain. You go on fighting and waging war. You do not have because of your not asking. 3 When you do ask, you do not receive because you are asking for a wrong purpose, so that you may spend it on your fleshly desires.\n4 Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is making himself an enemy of God. 5 Or do you think that for no reason the scripture says: \"The spirit that has taken up residence within us keeps enviously longing\"? 6 However, the undeserved kindness that He gives is greater. So it says: \"God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.\"\n7 Therefore, subject yourselves to God; but oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones. 9 Give way to misery and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into despair. 10 Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will exalt you.\n11 Stop speaking against one another, brothers. Whoever speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law. Now if you judge law, you are not a doer of law but a judge. 12 There is only one who is Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and to destroy. But you, who are you to be judging your neighbor?\n13 Come, now, you who say: \"Today or tomorrow we will travel to this city and will spend a year there, and we will do business and make some profit,\" 14 whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears. 15 Instead, you should say: \"If Jehovah wills, we will live and do this or that.\" 16 But now you take pride in your arrogant boasting. All such boasting is wicked. 17 Therefore, if someone knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him.\nChapter 5\n1 Come, now, you rich men, weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you. 2 Your riches have rotted, and your clothing has become moth-eaten. 3 Your gold and silver have rusted away, and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh. What you have stored up will be like a fire in the last days. 4 Look! The wages you have withheld from the workers who harvested your fields keep crying out, and the cries for help of the reapers have reached the ears of Jehovah of armies. 5 You have lived in luxury and for self-gratification on the earth. You have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one. Is he not opposing you?\n7 Be patient then, brothers, until the presence of the Lord. Look! The farmer keeps waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, exercising patience over it until the early rain and the late rain arrive. 8 You too exercise patience; make your hearts firm, because the presence of the Lord has drawn close.\n9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you do not get judged. Look! The Judge is standing before the doors. 10 Brothers, take as a pattern of the suffering of evil and the exercising of patience the prophets who spoke in the name of Jehovah. 11 Look! We consider happy those who have endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave, that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.\n12 Above all, my brothers, stop swearing, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. But let your \"Yes\" mean yes and your \"No,\" no, so that you do not become liable to judgment.\n13 Is there anyone suffering hardship among you? Let him carry on prayer. Is there anyone in good spirits? Let him sing psalms. 14 Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the elders of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, applying oil to him in the name of Jehovah. 15 And the prayer of faith will make the sick one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\n16 Therefore, openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. A righteous man's supplication has a powerful effect. 17 Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet when he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 Then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land produced fruit.\n19 My brothers, if anyone among you is led astray from the truth and another turns him back, 20 know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save him from death and will cover a multitude of sins. \n",

    "text": "First Peter\nChapter 1\n1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the temporary residents scattered about in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, to those chosen 2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, with sanctification by the spirit, for the purpose of being obedient and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ:\nMay undeserved kindness and peace be increased to you.\n3 Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens for you, 5 who are being safeguarded by God's power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last period of time. 6 Because of this you are greatly rejoicing, though for a short time, if it must be, you have been distressed by various trials, 7 in order that the tested quality of your faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being tested by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 8 Though you never saw him, you love him. Though you do not see him now, yet you exercise faith in him and are greatly rejoicing with an indescribable and glorious joy, 9 as you attain the goal of your faith, your salvation.\n10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the undeserved kindness meant for you made a diligent inquiry and a careful search. 11 They kept on investigating what particular time or what season the spirit within them was indicating concerning Christ as it testified beforehand about the sufferings meant for Christ and about the glory that would follow. 12 It was revealed to them that they were ministering, not to themselves, but to you, regarding what has now been announced to you by those who declared the good news to you with holy spirit sent from heaven. Into these very things, angels are desiring to peer.\n13 So brace up your minds for activity; keep your senses completely; set your hope on the undeserved kindness that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 14 As obedient children, stop being molded by the desires you formerly had in your ignorance, 15 but like the Holy One who called you, become holy yourselves in all your conduct, 16 for it is written: \"You must be holy, because I am holy.\"\n17 And if you are calling on the Father who judges impartially according to each one's work, conduct yourselves with fear during the time of your temporary residence. 18 For you know that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were set free from your futile way of life handed down to you by your forefathers. 19 But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, that of Christ. 20 True, he was foreknown before the founding of the world, but he was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake. 21 Through him you are believers in God, the one who raised him up from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.\n22 Now that you have purified yourselves by your obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly affection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart. 23 For you have been given a new birth, not by corruptible, but by incorruptible seed, through the word of the living and enduring God. 24 For \"all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like a blossom of the field; the grass withers, and the flower falls off, 25 but the saying of Jehovah endures forever.\" And this \"saying\" is the good news that was declared to you.\nChapter 2\n1 So rid yourselves of all badness and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all backbiting. 2 As newborn infants, form a longing for the unadulterated milk of the word, so that by means of it you may grow to salvation, 3 provided you have tasted that the Lord is kind.\n4 As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen, precious to God, 5 you yourselves as living stones are being built up into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, in order to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 6 For it says in Scripture: \"Look! I am laying in Zion a chosen stone, a precious foundation cornerstone, and no one exercising faith in it will ever be disappointed.\"\n7 It is to you, therefore, that he is precious, because you are believers; but to those not believing, \"the stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone\" 8 and \"a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.\" They are stumbling because they are disobedient to the word. To this very end they were appointed. 9 But you are \"a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies\" of the One who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 10 For you were once not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not been shown mercy, but now you have received mercy.\n11 Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to keep abstaining from fleshly desires, which wage war against you. 12 Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers, they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works and, as a result, glorify God in the day of his inspection.\n13 For the Lord's sake subject yourselves to every human creation, whether to a king as being superior 14 or to governors as sent by him to punish wrongdoers but to praise those who do good. 15 For it is the will of God that by doing good you may silence the ignorant talk of unreasonable men. 16 Be as free people, using your freedom, not as a cover for doing wrong, but as slaves of God. 17 Honor men of all sorts, have love for the whole association of brothers, be in fear of God, honor the king.\n18 Let servants be in subjection to their masters with all due fear, not only to the good and reasonable but also to those hard to please. 19 For it is agreeable when someone endures hardship and suffers unjustly because of conscience toward God. 20 For what merit is there if you are beaten for sinning and you endure it? But if you endure suffering because of doing good, this is an agreeable thing to God.\n21 In fact, to this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely. 22 He committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth. 23 When he was being insulted, he did not insult in return. When he was suffering, he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously. 24 He himself bore our sins in his own body on the stake, so that we might die to sins and live to righteousness. And \"by his wounds you were healed.\" 25 For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.\nChapter 3\n1 In the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, 2 because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect. 3 Do not let your adornment be external-the braiding of hair and the wearing of gold ornaments or fine clothing- 4 but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God. 5 For this is how the holy women of the past who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands, 6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you have become her children, provided you continue doing good and do not give in to fear.\n7 You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered.\n8 Finally, all of you have unity of mind, fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion, and humility. 9 Do not pay back injury for injury or insult for insult. Instead, repay with a blessing, for you were called to this course, so that you might inherit a blessing.\n10 For \"whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad and his lips from speaking deception. 11 Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good; let him seek peace and pursue it. 12 For the eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication, but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad things.\"\n13 Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not fear what they fear, nor be disturbed. 15 But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.\n16 Maintain a good conscience, so that in whatever way you are spoken against, those who speak against you may be put to shame because of your good conduct as followers of Christ. 17 For it is better to suffer because you are doing good, if it is God's will to allow it, than because you are doing evil. 18 For Christ died once for all time for sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, in order to lead you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. 19 And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison, 20 who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting in Noah's day, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.\n21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you (not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request to God for a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 22 He is at God's right hand, for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him.\nChapter 4\n1 Since Christ suffered in the flesh, you too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition; because the person who has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, 2 so that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God's will. 3 For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have done the will of the nations when you carried on in acts of brazen conduct, unbridled passions, overdrinking, wild parties, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries. 4 They are puzzled that you do not continue running with them in the same decadent course of debauchery, so they speak abusively of you. 5 But these people will render an account to the one who is ready to judge those living and those dead. 6 In fact, this is why the good news was declared also to the dead, so that although they are judged in the flesh from the standpoint of men, they might live in harmony with the spirit from God's standpoint.\n7 But the end of all things has drawn close. Therefore, be sound in mind, and be vigilant with a view to prayers. 8 Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. 9 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. 10 To the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God's undeserved kindness that is expressed in various ways. 11 If anyone speaks, let him do so as speaking pronouncements from God; if anyone ministers, let him do so as depending on the strength that God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. The glory and the might are his forever and ever. Amen.\n12 Beloved ones, do not be surprised about the fiery trials that you are experiencing, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 On the contrary, go on rejoicing over the extent to which you are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ, so that you may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory. 14 If you are being reproached for the name of Christ, you are happy, because the spirit of glory, yes, the spirit of God, is resting upon you.\n15 However, let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a wrongdoer or a busybody in other people's matters. 16 But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but let him keep on glorifying God while bearing this name. 17 For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. Now if it starts first with us, what will the outcome be for those who are not obedient to the good news of God? 18 \"And if the righteous man is being saved with difficulty, what will happen to the ungodly man and the sinner?\" 19 So, then, let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God keep on entrusting themselves to a faithful Creator while they are doing good.\nChapter 5\n1 Therefore, as a fellow elder, a witness of the sufferings of the Christ and a sharer of the glory that is to be revealed, I make this appeal to the elders among you: 2 Shepherd the flock of God under your care, serving as overseers, not under compulsion, but willingly before God; not for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly; 3 not lording it over those who are God's inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock. 4 And when the chief shepherd has been made manifest, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.\n5 In the same way, you younger men, be in subjection to the older men. But all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.\n6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time, 7 while you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. 8 Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. 9 But take your stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world. 10 But after you have suffered a little while, the God of all undeserved kindness, who called you to his everlasting glory in union with Christ, will himself finish your training. He will make you firm, he will make you strong, he will firmly ground you. 11 To him be the might forever. Amen.\n12 Through Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written you in few words in order to encourage you and to give an earnest witness that this is the true undeserved kindness of God. Stand firm in it. 13 She who is in Babylon, a chosen one like you, sends you her greetings, and so does Mark, my son. 14 Greet one another with a kiss of love.\nMay all of you who are in union with Christ have peace. \n",

    "text": "Exodus\nChapter 1\n1 Now these are the names of Israel's sons who came into Egypt with Jacob, each man who came with his household: 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 4 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 5 And all those who were born to Jacob were 70 people, but Joseph was already in Egypt. 6 Joseph eventually died, and also all his brothers and all that generation. 7 And the Israelites became fruitful and began to increase greatly, and they kept on multiplying and growing mightier at an extraordinary rate, so that the land became filled with them.\n8 In time there arose over Egypt a new king, one who did not know Joseph. 9 So he said to his people: \"Look! The people of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we are. 10 Let us deal shrewdly with them. Otherwise, they will continue to multiply, and if a war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight against us and leave the country.\"\n11 So they appointed chiefs of forced labor over them to oppress them with hard labor, and they built storage cities for Pharaoh, namely, Pithom and Raamses. 12 But the more they would oppress them, the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading out, so they felt sick with fear because of the Israelites. 13 Consequently, the Egyptians forced the Israelites into harsh slavery. 14 They made their life bitter with hard labor, as they worked with clay mortar and bricks and in every form of slavery in the field. Yes, they made them toil in harsh conditions in every form of slavery.\n15 Later the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 16 and he told them: \"When you help the Hebrew women to give birth and you see them on the stool for childbirth, you must put the child to death if it is a son; but if it is a daughter, she must live.\" 17 However, the midwives feared the true God, and they did not do what the king of Egypt told them. Instead, they would keep the male children alive. 18 In time the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them: \"Why have you kept the male children alive?\" 19 The midwives said to Pharaoh: \"The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. They are lively and have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them.\"\n20 So God dealt well with the midwives, and the people kept increasing and becoming very mighty. 21 And because the midwives had feared the true God, he later gave them families. 22 Finally Pharaoh commanded all his people: \"You are to throw every newborn son of the Hebrews into the Nile River, but you are to keep every daughter alive.\"\nChapter 2\n1 About that time, a certain man of the house of Levi married a daughter of Levi. 2 And the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw how beautiful he was, she kept him concealed for three months. 3 When she was no longer able to conceal him, she took a papyrus basket and coated it with bitumen and pitch and put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile River. 4 But his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.\n5 When Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe in the Nile, her female attendants were walking by the side of the Nile. And she caught sight of the basket in the middle of the reeds. She immediately sent her slave girl to get it. 6 When she opened it, she saw the child, and the boy was crying. She felt compassion for him, but she said: \"This is one of the children of the Hebrews.\" 7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter: \"Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?\" 8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her: \"Go!\" At once the girl went and called the child's mother. 9 Pharaoh's daughter then said to her: \"Take this child with you and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.\" So the woman took the child and nursed him. 10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became a son to her. She named him Moses and said: \"It is because I have drawn him out of the water.\"\n11 Now in those days, after Moses had become an adult, he went out to his brothers to look at the burdens they were bearing, and he caught sight of an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brothers. 12 So he looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.\n13 But he went out on the following day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting with each other. So he said to the one in the wrong: \"Why do you strike your companion?\" 14 At this he said: \"Who appointed you as a prince and a judge over us? Are you planning to kill me just as you killed the Egyptian?\" Moses now was afraid and said: \"Surely the matter has become known!\"\n15 Then Pharaoh heard about it, and he attempted to kill Moses; but Moses ran away from Pharaoh and went to dwell in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and these came to draw water and to fill the troughs to water their father's flock. 17 But as usual, the shepherds came and drove them away. At this Moses got up and helped the women and watered their flock. 18 When they came home to their father Reuel, he exclaimed: \"How is it that you have come home so quickly today?\" 19 They replied: \"A certain Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds, and he even drew water for us and watered the flock.\" 20 He said to his daughters: \"But where is he? Why did you leave the man behind? Call him, so that he may eat with us.\" 21 After that Moses consented to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 22 Later she bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, \"I have become a foreign resident in a foreign land.\"\n23 After a long time, the king of Egypt died, but the Israelites continued to groan because of the slavery and to cry out in complaint, and their cry for help because of the slavery kept going up to the true God. 24 In time God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 25 So God looked on the Israelites; and God took notice.\nChapter 3\n1 Moses became a shepherd of the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. While he was leading the flock to the west side of the wilderness, he eventually came to the mountain of the true God, to Horeb. 2 Then Jehovah's angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, he saw that the thornbush was on fire, and yet the thornbush was not consumed. 3 So Moses said: \"I will go over to inspect this unusual sight to see why the thornbush does not burn up.\" 4 When Jehovah saw that he went over to look, God called to him out of the thornbush and said: \"Moses! Moses!\" to which he said: \"Here I am.\" 5 Then he said: \"Do not come any nearer. Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy ground.\"\n6 He went on to say: \"I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at the true God. 7 Jehovah added: \"I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry because of those who force them to work; I well know the pains they suffer. 8 I will go down to rescue them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious, a land flowing with milk and honey, the territory of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 9 Now look! The outcry of the people of Israel has reached me, and I have seen also the harsh way that the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10 Now come, I will send you to Pharaoh, and you will bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.\"\n11 However, Moses said to the true God: \"Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?\" 12 To this he said: \"I will prove to be with you, and this is the sign for you that it was I who sent you: After you have brought the people out of Egypt, you people will serve the true God on this mountain.\"\n13 But Moses said to the true God: \"Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your forefathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, 'What is his name?' What should I say to them?\" 14 So God said to Moses: \"I Will Become What I Choose to Become.\" And he added: \"This is what you are to say to the Israelites, 'I Will Become has sent me to you.'\" 15 Then God said once more to Moses:\n\"This is what you are to say to the Israelites, 'Jehovah the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation. 16 Now go, and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, 'Jehovah the God of your forefathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and he said: \"I have certainly taken notice of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt. 17 So I say, I will take you away from affliction at the hands of the Egyptians to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.\"'\n18 \"They will certainly listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you men should say to him: 'Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has communicated with us. So, please, let us make a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.' 19 But I myself well know that the king of Egypt will not give you permission to go unless a mighty hand compels him. 20 So I will have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my extraordinary acts that I will do in it, and after that he will send you out. 21 And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and when you go, you will by no means go empty-handed. 22 Each woman must ask her neighbor and the woman lodging in her house for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing, and you will put them on your sons and your daughters; and you will plunder the Egyptians.\"\nChapter 4\n1 However, Moses answered: \"But suppose they do not believe me and do not listen to my voice, for they will say, 'Jehovah did not appear to you.'\" 2 Then Jehovah said to him: \"What is that in your hand?\" He answered: \"A rod.\" 3 He said: \"Throw it on the ground.\" So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. 4 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Reach out your hand and seize it by the tail.\" So he reached out and seized it, and it became a rod in his hand. 5 God then said: \"This is so that they may believe that Jehovah the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.\"\n6 Jehovah said to him once more: \"Put your hand, please, into the upper fold of your garment.\" So he put his hand into the fold of his garment. When he drew it out, why, his hand was stricken with leprosy like snow! 7 Then he said: \"Return your hand into the upper fold of your garment.\" So he returned his hand into his garment. When he drew it out of the garment, it was restored like the rest of his flesh! 8 He said: \"If they will not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, then they will certainly heed the next sign. 9 Still, even if they will not believe these two signs and refuse to listen to your voice, you will take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry land, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry land.\"\n10 Moses now said to Jehovah: \"Pardon me, Jehovah, but I have never been a fluent speaker, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.\" 11 Jehovah said to him: \"Who made a mouth for man, or who makes them speechless, deaf, clear-sighted, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah? 12 So go now, and I will be with you as you speak, and I will teach you what you should say.\" 13 But he said: \"Pardon me, Jehovah, please send anyone whom you want to send.\" 14 Then Jehovah's anger blazed against Moses, and he said: \"What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak very well. And he is now on his way here to meet you. When he sees you, his heart will rejoice. 15 So you must speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with you and him as you speak, and I will teach you men what to do. 16 He will speak for you to the people, and he will be your spokesman, and you will serve as God to him. 17 And you will take this rod in your hand and perform the signs with it.\"\n18 So Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him: \"I want to go, please, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.\" Jethro said to Moses: \"Go in peace.\" 19 After that Jehovah said to Moses in Midian: \"Go, return to Egypt, because all the men who were seeking to kill you are dead.\"\n20 Then Moses took his wife and his sons and lifted them onto a donkey, and he started back to the land of Egypt. Moreover, Moses took the rod of the true God in his hand. 21 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"After you have returned to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have empowered you to do. But I will allow his heart to become obstinate, and he will not send the people away. 22 You must say to Pharaoh, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Israel is my son, my firstborn. 23 I say to you, Send my son away so that he may serve me. But if you refuse to send him away, I am going to kill your son, your firstborn.\"'\"\n24 Now on the road at the lodging place, Jehovah met him and was seeking to put him to death. 25 Finally Zipporah took a flint and circumcised her son and caused his foreskin to touch his feet and said: \"It is because you are a bridegroom of blood to me.\" 26 So He let him go. At that time she said, \"a bridegroom of blood,\" because of the circumcision.\n27 Then Jehovah said to Aaron: \"Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\" So he went and met him at the mountain of the true God and greeted him with a kiss. 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah, who had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do. 29 After that Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the Israelites. 30 Aaron told them all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs before the eyes of the people. 31 At this the people believed. When they heard that Jehovah had turned his attention to the Israelites and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed down and prostrated themselves.\nChapter 5\n1 Afterward, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'Send my people away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.'\" 2 But Pharaoh said: \"Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all, and what is more, I will not send Israel away.\" 3 But they said: \"The God of the Hebrews has communicated with us. Please, we want to make a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise, he will strike us with disease or with the sword.\" 4 The king of Egypt replied to them: \"Why is it, Moses and Aaron, that you are taking the people away from their work? Return to your labor!\" 5 And Pharaoh continued: \"Look at how many people of the land there are, and you would have them rest from their labor.\"\n6 That same day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foremen: 7 \"You must no longer give straw to the people to make bricks. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8 But you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as they made in the past. Do not reduce it for them, for they are relaxing. That is why they are crying out, 'We want to go, we want to sacrifice to our God!' 9 Make them work harder, and keep them busy so that they will not pay attention to lies.\"\n10 So the taskmasters and their foremen went out and said to the people: \"Here is what Pharaoh has said, 'I am giving you no more straw. 11 Go and get your own straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'\" 12 Then the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 13 And the taskmasters kept urging them: \"You must each finish your work every day, just as when straw was provided.\" 14 Also the foremen of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had appointed over them, were beaten. They asked them: \"Why did you not reach the quota of bricks that you used to make? It happened both yesterday and today.\"\n15 So the foremen of the Israelites went in and complained to Pharaoh: \"Why are you treating your servants this way? 16 No straw is given to your servants, yet they are saying to us, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are beaten, but your own people are at fault.\" 17 But he said: \"You are relaxing, you are relaxing! That is why you are saying, 'We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.' 18 So now go, get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you must still produce your quota of bricks.\"\n19 Then the foremen of the Israelites saw that they were in serious trouble because of the order: \"You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks at all.\" 20 After that they met up with Moses and Aaron, who were standing there to meet them as they came out from Pharaoh. 21 At once they said to them: \"May Jehovah look upon you and judge, since you have made Pharaoh and his servants despise us and you have put a sword in their hand to kill us.\" 22 Then Moses turned to Jehovah and said: \"Jehovah, why have you afflicted this people? Why have you sent me? 23 From the time that I went in before Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt worse with this people, and you have certainly not rescued your people.\"\nChapter 6\n1 So Jehovah said to Moses: \"Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. A mighty hand will force him to send them away, and a mighty hand will force him to drive them out of his land.\"\n2 Then God said to Moses: \"I am Jehovah. 3 And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but with regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them. 4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as foreigners. 5 Now I myself have heard the groaning of the people of Israel, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I remember my covenant.\n6 \"Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery, and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. 7 And I will take you in as my people, and I will be your God, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt. 8 And I will bring you into the land that I swore with an oath to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as something to possess. I am Jehovah.'\"\n9 Moses later gave this message to the Israelites, but they did not listen to Moses because of their discouragement and because of the harsh slavery.\n10 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying: 11 \"Go in and tell Pharaoh, Egypt's king, that he should send the Israelites away out of his land.\" 12 However, Moses replied to Jehovah: \"Look! The Israelites have not listened to me; how will Pharaoh ever listen to me, as I speak with difficulty?\" 13 But Jehovah again told Moses and Aaron what commands to give to the Israelites and to Pharaoh, Egypt's king, in order to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.\n14 These are the heads of the house of their fathers: The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben.\n15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families of Simeon.\n16 These are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their family descents: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. The length of Levi's life was 137 years.\n17 The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, according to their families.\n18 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. The length of Kohath's life was 133 years.\n19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.\nThese were the families of the Levites, according to their family descents.\n20 Now Amram took Jochebed, his father's sister, as his wife. She bore him Aaron and Moses. The length of Amram's life was 137 years.\n21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.\n22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.\n23 Now Aaron took Elisheba, Amminadab's daughter, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife. She bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.\n24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the families of the Korahites.\n25 Eleazar, Aaron's son, took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife. She bore him Phinehas.\nThese are the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites, according to their families.\n26 This is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said: \"Bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, company by company.\" 27 It was they who spoke to Pharaoh, Egypt's king, to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt. It was this Moses and Aaron.\n28 On that day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 29 Jehovah told Moses: \"I am Jehovah. Speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, everything I am speaking to you.\" 30 Then Moses said before Jehovah: \"Look! I speak with difficulty, so how will Pharaoh ever listen to me?\"\nChapter 7\n1 Jehovah then said to Moses: \"See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet. 2 You are to repeat everything that I will command you, and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh, and he will send the Israelites away from his land. 3 As for me, I will allow Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate, and I will multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt. 4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt and bring my multitudes, my people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments. 5 And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.\" 6 Moses and Aaron did what Jehovah had commanded them; they did just so. 7 Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.\n8 Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron: 9 \"If Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then tell Aaron, 'Take your rod and throw it down before Pharaoh.' It will become a big snake.\" 10 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and did exactly as Jehovah had commanded. Aaron threw his rod down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a big snake. 11 However, Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and the magic-practicing priests of Egypt also did the same thing with their magic. 12 Each one threw down his rod, and they became big snakes; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 13 Still, Pharaoh's heart became obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n14 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Pharaoh's heart is unresponsive. He has refused to send the people away. 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Look! He is going out to the water! And you should station yourself to meet him by the edge of the Nile River; and take with you in your hand the rod that turned into a serpent. 16 And you must say to him, 'Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, and he says: \"Send my people away so that they may serve me in the wilderness,\" but you have not obeyed until now. 17 This is what Jehovah says: \"By this you will know that I am Jehovah. Here I am striking the water that is in the Nile River with the rod that is in my hand, and it will turn into blood. 18 And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will find it impossible to drink water from the Nile.\"'\"\n19 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Say to Aaron, 'Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over its rivers, over its canals, over its marshes, and over all its reservoirs, that they may become blood.' There will be blood in all the land of Egypt, even in the wooden and stone containers.\" 20 Immediately Moses and Aaron did just as Jehovah had commanded. He lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile River before the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants, and all the water that was in the river was turned into blood. 21 And the fish that were in the river died, and the river began to stink, and the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the Nile, and there was blood throughout the land of Egypt.\n22 Nevertheless, the magic-practicing priests of Egypt did the same thing with their secret arts, so that Pharaoh's heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said. 23 Then Pharaoh returned to his house, and he did not take this to heart either. 24 So all the Egyptians were digging all around the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink any water of the Nile. 25 And seven full days passed after Jehovah struck the Nile.\nChapter 8\n1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Send my people away so that they may serve me. 2 If you keep refusing to send them away, I will plague all your territory with frogs. 3 And the Nile River will swarm with frogs, and they will come up and enter into your house, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants and on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs. 4 On you, on your people, and on all your servants, the frogs will come up.\"'\"\n5 Jehovah later said to Moses: \"Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, the Nile canals, and the marshes, and make the frogs come up over the land of Egypt.'\" 6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs began to come up and to cover the land of Egypt. 7 However, the magic-practicing priests did the same thing by their secret arts, and they too made the frogs come up over the land of Egypt. 8 Pharaoh then called Moses and Aaron and said: \"Plead with Jehovah to remove the frogs from me and my people, as I want to send the people away so that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.\" 9 Then Moses said to Pharaoh: \"I leave to you the honor of telling me when I should plead to have the frogs removed from you, your servants, your people, and your houses. Only in the Nile River will they be left.\" 10 To this he said: \"Tomorrow.\" So he said: \"It will be according to your word so that you may know that there is no one else like Jehovah our God. 11 The frogs will depart from you, your houses, your servants, and your people. They will be left only in the Nile.\"\n12 So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses pleaded with Jehovah about the frogs that He had brought upon Pharaoh. 13 Then Jehovah did as Moses asked, and the frogs began to die in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields. 14 They were piling them up in countless heaps, and the land began to stink. 15 When Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and he refused to listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n16 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the earth, and it must become gnats in all the land of Egypt.'\" 17 And they did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and the gnats came on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt. 18 The magic-practicing priests tried to do the same and produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. And the gnats came on man and beast. 19 So the magic-practicing priests said to Pharaoh: \"It is the finger of God!\" But Pharaoh's heart continued to be obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n20 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of Pharaoh. Look! He is coming out to the water! And you must say to him, 'This is what Jehovah has said: \"Send my people away so that they may serve me. 21 But if you do not send my people away, I will send on you, your servants, and your people and into your houses the gadfly; and the houses of Egypt will be full of gadflies, and they will even cover the ground they stand on. 22 On that day I will certainly set apart the land of Goshen, where my people are dwelling. No gadflies will exist there, and by this you will know that I, Jehovah, am here in the land. 23 And I will make a distinction between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign will take place.\"'\"\n24 And Jehovah did so, and heavy swarms of gadflies began to invade the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of Egypt. The land was ruined by the gadflies. 25 Finally, Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said: \"Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.\" 26 But Moses said: \"It is not proper to do so, because what we would sacrifice to Jehovah our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we would make a sacrifice that was detestable to the Egyptians right before their eyes, would they not stone us? 27 We will make a three-day journey into the wilderness, and there we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God, just as he has said to us.\"\n28 Pharaoh now said: \"I will send you away to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness. Only, you must not go so far away. Plead in my behalf.\" 29 Then Moses said: \"Now I am going away from you, and I will plead with Jehovah, and the gadflies will depart from Pharaoh, his servants, and his people tomorrow. But Pharaoh must stop trifling with us by refusing to send the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah.\" 30 Moses then went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with Jehovah. 31 So Jehovah did according to Moses' word, and the gadflies departed from Pharaoh, his servants, and his people. Not one was left. 32 However, Pharaoh again hardened his heart and did not send the people away.\nChapter 9\n1 So Jehovah said to Moses: \"Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: \"Send my people away so that they may serve me. 2 But if you refuse to send them away and you keep holding them, 3 look! Jehovah's hand will come against your livestock in the field. On the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herd, and the flock, there will be a devastating plague. 4 And Jehovah will certainly make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing that belongs to the Israelites will die.\"'\" 5 Moreover, Jehovah set an appointed time, saying: \"Tomorrow Jehovah will do this in the land.\"\n6 And Jehovah did this on the very next day, and all sorts of livestock of Egypt began to die, but not one of Israel's livestock died. 7 When Pharaoh inquired, look! not so much as one of Israel's livestock had died. Nevertheless, Pharaoh's heart continued to be unresponsive, and he did not send the people away.\n8 Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron: \"Fill both of your hands with soot from a kiln, and Moses must throw it into the air in front of Pharaoh. 9 And it will become a fine dust on all the land of Egypt, and it will become festering boils on man and beast in all the land of Egypt.\"\n10 So they took soot from a kiln and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses tossed it into the air, and it became festering boils breaking out on man and beast. 11 The magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before Moses because of the boils, for they had developed on the magic-practicing priests and on all the Egyptians. 12 But Jehovah allowed Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had told Moses.\n13 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Get up early in the morning and station yourself in front of Pharaoh, and say to him, 'This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said: \"Send my people away so that they may serve me. 14 For now I am directing all my blows to strike your heart, your servants, and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 15 For by now I could have thrust my hand out to strike you and your people with a devastating plague, and you would have been wiped out from the earth. 16 But for this very reason I have kept you in existence: to show you my power and to have my name declared in all the earth. 17 Are you still behaving arrogantly against my people by not sending them away? 18 Here I will cause a very great hail to rain down tomorrow about this time, such as has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 19 Therefore, send word to bring all your livestock and all that is yours in the field under shelter. Every man and beast caught in the field and not brought into the house will die when the hail comes down on them.\"'\"\n20 Anyone among Pharaoh's servants who feared Jehovah's word quickly brought his own servants and his livestock into the houses, 21 but whoever did not take Jehovah's word to heart left his servants and his livestock in the field.\n22 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, so that hail may come down on all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.\" 23 So Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire fell down to the earth, and Jehovah kept making it rain down hail on the land of Egypt. 24 There was hail, and there was fire flashing in the midst of the hail. It was very heavy; there had never been any like it in the land since Egypt had become a nation. 25 The hail struck everything in the field throughout the land of Egypt, from man to beast, and it struck down all the vegetation and shattered all the trees of the field. 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.\n27 So Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them: \"I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are in the wrong. 28 Plead with Jehovah that there may be an end to God's thunder and hail. Then I will be willing to send you away, and you will not stay any longer.\" 29 So Moses said to him: \"As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands before Jehovah. The thunder will stop and the hail will not continue any longer, so that you may know that the earth belongs to Jehovah. 30 But as for you and your servants, I know already that even then, you will not fear Jehovah God.\"\n31 Now the flax and the barley had been struck down, because the barley was in the ear and the flax had flower buds. 32 But the wheat and the spelt had not been struck down, because they were later crops. 33 Moses now went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands before Jehovah, and the thunder and the hail stopped and the rain quit pouring down on the earth. 34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had stopped, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he as well as his servants. 35 And Pharaoh's heart continued obstinate, and he did not send the Israelites away, just as Jehovah had stated through Moses.\nChapter 10\n1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Go in to Pharaoh, for I have allowed his heart and the hearts of his servants to become unresponsive, so that I may display these signs of mine right before him, 2 and in order that you may declare to your sons and your grandsons how severely I have dealt with Egypt and what signs I have performed among them; and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.\"\n3 So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him: \"This is what Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has said, 'How long will you refuse to submit to me? Send my people away so that they may serve me. 4 For if you keep refusing to send my people away, here I am bringing locusts within your boundaries tomorrow. 5 And they will cover the surface of the earth, and it will not be possible to see the ground. They will eat up what escaped the hail and was left for you, and they will eat all your trees that are growing in the field. 6 They will fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all Egypt to an extent that your fathers and your grandfathers never saw from the time they have been in this land until today.'\" With that he turned and went out from Pharaoh.\n7 Then Pharaoh's servants said to him: \"How long will this man continue to menace us? Send the men away so that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt has been ruined?\" 8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them: \"Go, serve Jehovah your God. But just who will be going?\" 9 Then Moses said: \"We will go with our young people, our old people, our sons, our daughters, our sheep, and our cattle, because we will hold a festival to Jehovah.\" 10 He said to them: \"If I ever send you and your children away, then Jehovah is indeed with you! It is clear that you intend to do something evil. 11 No! Only your men may go and serve Jehovah, for that is what you requested.\" With that they were driven out from before Pharaoh.\n12 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come up over the land of Egypt and eat up all the vegetation of the land, everything that the hail has let remain.\" 13 At once Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah caused an east wind to blow on the land all that day and all night. The morning came, and the east wind brought the locusts. 14 And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down on the whole territory of Egypt. It was extremely severe; never before had there been so many locusts, nor would there ever be so many again. 15 They covered the surface of the entire land, and the land grew dark with them; they devoured all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; nothing green was left on the trees or on the vegetation of the field in all the land of Egypt.\n16 So Pharaoh quickly called Moses and Aaron and said: \"I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you. 17 Now, please, pardon my sin just this once, and plead with Jehovah your God that he just remove this deadly plague from upon me.\" 18 So he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with Jehovah. 19 Then Jehovah caused the wind to shift, and it became a very stiff west wind, and it carried the locusts away and drove them into the Red Sea. Not a single locust remained in all the territory of Egypt. 20 However, Jehovah allowed Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate, and he did not send the Israelites away.\n21 Jehovah then said to Moses: \"Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness so thick that it can be felt.\" 22 Moses immediately stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was a dense darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 23 They did not see one another, and none of them got up from where they were for three days; but all the Israelites had light in their dwellings. 24 Pharaoh then called Moses and said: \"Go, serve Jehovah. Only your sheep and your cattle will remain behind. Even your children may go with you.\" 25 But Moses said: \"You yourself will also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings, and we will offer them to Jehovah our God. 26 Our livestock will also go with us. Not an animal will be allowed to remain, because we will be using some of them to worship Jehovah our God, and we do not know what we will offer in worship to Jehovah until we arrive there.\" 27 So Jehovah allowed Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate, and he did not consent to send them away. 28 Pharaoh said to him: \"Get out of my sight! Make sure that you do not try to see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.\" 29 To this Moses said: \"Just as you have spoken, I will not try to see your face again.\"\nChapter 11\n1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"One more plague I am going to bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt. After that he will send you away from here. When he does send you away, he will literally drive you out of here. 2 Now tell the people that all the men and women should ask their neighbor for articles of silver and of gold.\" 3 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself had become highly esteemed in the land of Egypt among Pharaoh's servants and among the people.\n4 Moses then said: \"This is what Jehovah has said, 'About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt, 5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who is sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who is working at the hand mill, and every firstborn of the livestock. 6 Throughout all the land of Egypt, there will be a great outcry such as has never occurred nor will ever occur again. 7 But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites, at the men or their livestock, so that you may know that Jehovah can make a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.' 8 And all your servants will certainly come down to me and prostrate themselves to me, saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you.' And after that I will go out.\" With that he went out from Pharaoh in the heat of anger.\n9 Jehovah then said to Moses: \"Pharaoh will not listen to you, in order for my miracles to be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\" 10 Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles before Pharaoh, but Jehovah allowed Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate, so that he did not send the Israelites away from his land.\nChapter 12\n1 Jehovah now said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: 2 \"This month will be the beginning of the months for you. It will be the first of the months of the year for you. 3 Speak to the entire assembly of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they should each take for themselves a sheep for their father's house, a sheep to a house. 4 But if the household is too small for the sheep, they and their nearest neighbor should share it between themselves in their house according to the number of people. When making the calculation, determine how much of the sheep each one will eat. 5 Your sheep should be a sound, one year old male. You may choose from the young rams or from the goats. 6 You must care for it until the 14th day of this month, and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter it at twilight. 7 They must take some of the blood and splash it on the two doorposts and the upper part of the doorway of the houses in which they eat it.\n8 \"'They must eat the meat on this night. They should roast it over the fire and eat it along with unleavened bread and bitter greens. 9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled, cooked in water, but roast it over the fire, its head together with its shanks and its inner parts. 10 You must not save any of it until morning, but any of it left over until morning you should burn with fire. 11 And this is how you should eat it, with your belt fastened, sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you should eat it in a hurry. It is Jehovah's Passover. 12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and I will execute judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah. 13 The blood will serve as your sign on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass over you, and the plague will not come on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.\n14 \"'This day will serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations. As a lasting statute, you should celebrate it. 15 Seven days you are to eat unleavened bread. Yes, on the first day you are to remove the sourdough from your houses, because anyone eating what is leavened from the first day down to the seventh, that person must be cut off from Israel. 16 On the first day you will hold a holy convention, and on the seventh day, another holy convention. No work is to be done on these days. Only what every person needs to eat, that alone may be prepared for you.\n17 \"'You must keep the Festival of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day, I will bring your multitudes out of the land of Egypt. And you must keep this day throughout your generations as a lasting statute. 18 In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, in the evening, you are to eat unleavened bread until the 21st day of the month, in the evening. 19 No sourdough is to be found in your houses for seven days, because if anyone eats what is leavened, whether he is a foreigner or a native of the land, that person must be cut off from the assembly of Israel. 20 You should not eat anything leavened. In all your homes, you are to eat unleavened bread.'\"\n21 Moses promptly called all the elders of Israel and said to them: \"Go and select young animals for each of your families, and slaughter the Passover sacrifice. 22 Then you must dip a bunch of hyssop into the blood that is in a basin and strike the upper part of the doorway and the two doorposts with the blood; and none of you should go out of the entrance of his house until morning. 23 Then when Jehovah passes through to plague the Egyptians and sees the blood on the upper part of the doorway and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will certainly pass over the entrance, and he will not allow the plague of death to enter into your houses.\n24 \"You must observe this event as a lasting regulation for you and your sons. 25 And when you come into the land that Jehovah will give you just as he has stated, you must keep this observance. 26 And when your sons ask you, 'What does this observance mean to you?' 27 you must say, 'It is the sacrifice of the Passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he plagued the Egyptians, but he spared our houses.'\"\nThen the people bowed low and prostrated themselves. 28 So the Israelites went and did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.\n29 Then at midnight, Jehovah struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who was sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison, and every firstborn of the animals. 30 Pharaoh got up that night along with all his servants and all the other Egyptians, and there was a great outcry among the Egyptians, because there was not a house where someone was not dead. 31 At once he called Moses and Aaron by night and said: \"Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the other Israelites. Go and serve Jehovah, just as you have said. 32 Take also your flocks and your herds and go, just as you have said. But you must also bless me.\"\n33 And the Egyptians began to urge the people to depart quickly out of the land \"because,\" as they said, \"we are all as good as dead!\" 34 So the people carried their flour dough before it was leavened, with their kneading troughs wrapped up in their clothing on their shoulder. 35 The Israelites did what Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and of gold as well as clothing. 36 Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they asked for, and they plundered the Egyptians.\n37 Then the Israelites departed from Rameses for Succoth, about 600,000 men on foot, besides children. 38 And a vast mixed company also went with them, as well as flocks and herds, a great number of livestock. 39 They began to bake the dough that they brought from Egypt into round loaves of unleavened bread. It was not leavened, because they had been driven out of Egypt so suddenly that they had not prepared any provisions for themselves.\n40 The dwelling of the Israelites, who had dwelled in Egypt, was 430 years. 41 At the end of the 430 years, on this very day, all the multitudes of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt. 42 It is a night on which they will celebrate Jehovah's bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This night is to be observed to Jehovah by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.\n43 Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, \"This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner may eat of it. 44 But if someone has a slave man who was purchased with money, you should circumcise him. Only then may he share in eating it. 45 A settler and a hired worker may not eat of it. 46 In one house it is to be eaten. You must not take any of the meat outside of the house, and you must not break any of its bones. 47 All the assembly of Israel are to celebrate it. 48 If a foreigner resides with you and he wants to celebrate the Passover to Jehovah, every male of his must be circumcised. Then he may come near to celebrate it, and he will become like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it. 49 One law will apply for the native and for the foreigner who is residing among you.\"\n50 So all the Israelites did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so. 51 On this very day, Jehovah brought the Israelites along with their multitudes out of the land of Egypt.\nChapter 13\n1 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 \"Sanctify to me every firstborn male among the Israelites. The first male to be born, of both human and animal, belongs to me.\"\n3 Then Moses said to the people: \"Remember this day on which you went out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, because with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of here. So nothing leavened may be eaten. 4 You are going out on this day, in the month of Abib. 5 When Jehovah has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you must keep this observance in this month. 6 Seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, there will be a festival to Jehovah. 7 Unleavened bread is to be eaten for the seven days; and nothing leavened is to be found with you, and no sourdough is to be found with you within all your territory. 8 And you must tell your son on that day, 'It is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt.' 9 And this will serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial on your forehead, so that Jehovah's law may be in your mouth, for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt. 10 You must keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.\n11 \"When Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites, which he has sworn to you and to your forefathers to give to you, 12 you must devote to Jehovah every firstborn male, as well as every male firstling of the livestock that you acquire. The males belong to Jehovah. 13 Every firstling donkey you are to redeem with a sheep, and if you do not redeem it, then you must break its neck. And every firstborn male of your sons you are to redeem.\n14 \"In case your son should ask you later on, 'What does this mean?' then you should say to him, 'With a mighty hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery. 15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to send us away, Jehovah killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast. That is why I am sacrificing to Jehovah all the firstborn males, and I redeem every firstborn of my sons.' 16 This must serve as a sign on your hand and as a headband on your forehead, for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.\"\n17 Now when Pharaoh sent the people away, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although it was near. For God said: \"The people may change their minds when they are confronted by war and will return to Egypt.\" 18 So God made the people go around by the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. But it was in battle formation that the Israelites went up out of the land of Egypt. 19 Moses also took Joseph's bones with him, because Joseph had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear: \"God will not fail to turn his attention to you, and you must take my bones up out of here with you.\" 20 They departed from Succoth and encamped at Etham, at the edge of the wilderness.\n21 Now Jehovah was going ahead of them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day and by night. 22 The pillar of cloud would not move away from before the people during the day, nor the pillar of fire at night.\nChapter 14\n1 Jehovah now said to Moses: 2 \"Tell the Israelites that they should turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, within view of Baal-zephon. You are to encamp facing it by the sea. 3 Then Pharaoh will say about the Israelites, 'They are wandering in confusion in the land. The wilderness has closed in on them.' 4 I will allow Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate, and he will chase after them, and I will glorify myself by means of Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah.\" So that is what they did.\n5 Later it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had run away. Immediately, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart regarding the people, and they said: \"Why did we do this and release Israel from serving as slaves for us?\" 6 So he made his war chariots ready, and he took his people with him. 7 He took 600 chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with warriors on every one of them. 8 Thus Jehovah allowed the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt to become obstinate, and he chased after the Israelites, while the Israelites were going out with confidence. 9 The Egyptians chased after them, and all the chariot horses of Pharaoh and his cavalrymen and his army were catching up with them while they were camping by the sea, by Pihahiroth, facing Baal-zephon.\n10 When Pharaoh got closer, the Israelites raised their eyes and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. The Israelites became terrified and began to cry out to Jehovah. 11 They said to Moses: \"Is it because there are no burial places in Egypt that you have brought us here to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by leading us out of Egypt? 12 Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt when we said, 'Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians'? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.\" 13 Then Moses said to the people: \"Do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah that he will perform for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you will never ever see again. 14 Jehovah himself will fight for you, and you will keep silent.\"\n15 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Why do you keep crying out to me? Tell the Israelites that they should break camp. 16 As for you, lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground. 17 As for me, I am allowing the hearts of the Egyptians to become obstinate, so that they will go in after them; thus I will glorify myself by means of Pharaoh and all his army, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen. 18 And the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I glorify myself by means of Pharaoh, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen.\"\n19 Then the angel of the true God who was going ahead of the camp of Israel departed and went to their rear, and the pillar of cloud that was in front of them moved to the rear and stood behind them. 20 So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. On the one side, it was a dark cloud. On the other side, it was lighting up the night. So the one camp did not come near the other camp all night long.\n21 Moses now stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah drove the sea back with a strong east wind all night long, turning the sea basin into dry ground, and the waters divided. 22 So the Israelites went through the midst of the sea on dry ground, while the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their left. 23 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses, his war chariots, and his cavalrymen began going after them into the midst of the sea. 24 During the morning watch, Jehovah looked at the camp of the Egyptians from within the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion. 25 He kept taking wheels off their chariots so that they were driving them with difficulty, and the Egyptians were saying: \"Let us flee from any contact with Israel, because Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.\"\n26 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, their war chariots, and their cavalrymen.\" 27 Moses at once stretched out his hand over the sea, and as morning approached, the sea returned to its normal condition. As the Egyptians fled from it, Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea. 28 The returning waters covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen and all of Pharaoh's army who had gone into the sea after them. Not so much as one among them was allowed to survive.\n29 But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the seabed, and the waters formed a wall on their right hand and on their left. 30 Thus Jehovah saved Israel on that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. 31 Israel also saw the great power that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians, and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah and in his servant Moses.\nChapter 15\n1 At that time Moses and the Israelites sang this song to Jehovah:\n\"Let me sing to Jehovah, for he has become highly exalted.\nThe horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.\n2 My strength and my might is Jah, since he has become my salvation.\nThis is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God, and I will exalt him.\n3 Jehovah is a powerful warrior. Jehovah is his name.\n4 Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea,\nAnd his finest warriors have sunk into the Red Sea.\n5 The surging waters covered them; down into the depths they sank like a stone.\n6 Your right hand, O Jehovah, is great in power;\nYour right hand, O Jehovah, can shatter an enemy.\n7 In your great majesty you can throw down those who rise up against you;\nYou send out your burning anger, it eats them up like stubble.\n8 By a breath from your nostrils waters massed together;\nThey stood still, holding back the floods;\nThe surging waters congealed in the heart of the sea.\n9 The enemy said: 'I will pursue! I will overtake!\nI will divide spoil until I am satisfied!\nI will draw my sword! My hand will subdue them!'\n10 You blew with your breath, the sea covered them;\nThey sank like lead in majestic waters.\n11 Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah?\nWho is like you, showing yourself mighty in holiness?\nThe One to be feared with songs of praise, the One doing wonders.\n12 You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them up.\n13 In your loyal love you have led the people whom you have redeemed;\nIn your strength you will guide them to your holy place of dwelling.\n14 Peoples must hear; they will shudder;\nAnguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia.\n15 At that time the sheikhs of Edom will be terrified,\nAnd trembling will take hold of the mighty rulers of Moab.\nAll the inhabitants of Canaan will be disheartened.\n16 Fear and dread will fall upon them.\nBecause of the greatness of your arm they will be as motionless as a stone\nUntil your people pass by, O Jehovah,\nUntil the people whom you produced pass by.\n17 You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,\nThe established place that you have prepared for yourself to inhabit, O Jehovah,\nA sanctuary, O Jehovah, that your hands have established.\n18 Jehovah will rule as king forever and ever.\n19 When Pharaoh's horses with his war chariots and his cavalrymen went into the sea,\nThen Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them,\nBut the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the midst of the sea.\"\n20 Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and with dances. 21 Miriam sang in response to the men:\n\"Sing to Jehovah, for he has become highly exalted.\nThe horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.\"\n22 Moses later led Israel away from the Red Sea, and they went out to the wilderness of Shur and marched on for three days in the wilderness, but they did not find water. 23 They came to Marah, but they were not able to drink the water from Marah because it was bitter. That is why he named it Marah. 24 So the people began to murmur against Moses, saying: \"What are we to drink?\" 25 He cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah directed him to a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became sweet.\nThere He established for them a regulation and a case for judgment, and there He put them to the test. 26 He said: \"If you will strictly listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and will do what is right in his eyes and will pay attention to his commandments and keep all his regulations, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians, for I, Jehovah, am healing you.\"\n27 After that they came to Elim, where there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees. So they camped there by the water.\nChapter 16\n1 After they departed from Elim, the entire assembly of the Israelites eventually came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the 15th day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.\n2 Then the entire assembly of the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. 3 The Israelites kept saying to them: \"If only we had died by Jehovah's hand in the land of Egypt while we were sitting by the pots of meat, while we were eating bread to satisfaction. Now you have brought us out into this wilderness to put this whole congregation to death by famine.\"\n4 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Here I am raining down bread for you from the heavens, and each of the people should go out to gather his amount day by day, so that I may put them to the test to see whether they will walk in my law or not. 5 But on the sixth day when they prepare what they have gathered, it is to be double the amount that they pick up on each of the other days.\"\n6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: \"In the evening you will certainly know that it is Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 7 In the morning you will see Jehovah's glory, for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah. Who are we that you should murmur against us?\" 8 Moses continued: \"When Jehovah gives you meat to eat in the evening and in the morning bread to satisfaction, you will see that Jehovah has heard your murmurings that you are murmuring against him. But who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.\"\n9 Then Moses said to Aaron: \"Tell the entire assembly of the Israelites, 'Come near before Jehovah, for he has heard your murmurings.'\" 10 As soon as Aaron had spoken to the entire assembly of the Israelites, they turned and faced toward the wilderness, and look! Jehovah's glory appeared in the cloud.\n11 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 12 \"I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God.'\"\n13 So that evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning a layer of dew was all around the camp. 14 When the layer of dew evaporated, there was a fine, flaky substance on the surface of the wilderness, as fine as frost on the ground. 15 When the Israelites saw it, they began to say to one another, \"What is it?\" for they did not know what it was. Moses said to them: \"It is the bread that Jehovah has given you for food. 16 This is what Jehovah has commanded, 'Each one should gather it according to how much he can eat. You are to take an omer measure for each individual according to the number of the people that each of you has in his tent.'\" 17 The Israelites began to do so; they gathered it, some gathering much and some gathering little. 18 When they would measure it by the omer, the one who had gathered much had no surplus and the one who had gathered little had no shortage. They each gathered it according to what they could eat.\n19 Then Moses said to them: \"Nobody should leave any of it until the morning.\" 20 But they did not listen to Moses. When some men left some of it until the morning, it bred worms and stank, and Moses became indignant at them. 21 They would pick it up morning by morning, each one according to what he could eat. When the sun got hot, it melted.\n22 On the sixth day, they picked up twice as much bread, two omer measures for each person. So all the chieftains of the assembly came and reported it to Moses. 23 At that he said to them: \"It is what Jehovah has said. Tomorrow there will be a complete rest, a holy sabbath to Jehovah. Bake what you need to bake, and boil what you need to boil; then save whatever is left over and keep it until the morning.\" 24 So they saved it until the morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink nor were there maggots in it. 25 Then Moses said: \"Eat it today, because today is a sabbath to Jehovah. Today you will not find it on the ground. 26 You will pick it up for six days, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.\" 27 However, some of the people did go out to pick it up on the seventh day, but they found nothing.\n28 So Jehovah said to Moses: \"How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? 29 Take notice of the fact that Jehovah has given you the Sabbath. That is why he is giving you the bread for two days on the sixth day. Everyone must stay where he is; nobody is to leave his locality on the seventh day.\" 30 So the people observed the Sabbath on the seventh day.\n31 The house of Israel named the bread \"manna.\" It was white like coriander seed, and its taste was like that of flat cakes with honey. 32 Then Moses said: \"This is what Jehovah has commanded, 'Fill an omer measure of it as something to be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I was bringing you out of the land of Egypt.'\" 33 So Moses said to Aaron: \"Take a jar and put in it an omer measure of manna and deposit it before Jehovah as something to be kept throughout your generations.\" 34 Just as Jehovah commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the Testimony so that it might be preserved. 35 The Israelites ate the manna for 40 years, until they came to a land that was inhabited. They ate the manna until they came to the frontier of the land of Canaan. 36 Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah measure.\nChapter 17\n1 The entire assembly of the Israelites departed from the wilderness of Sin by stages according to the order of Jehovah, and they camped at Rephidim. But there was no water for the people to drink.\n2 So the people began quarreling with Moses and saying: \"Give us water to drink.\" But Moses said to them: \"Why are you quarreling with me? Why do you keep putting Jehovah to the test?\" 3 But the people were very thirsty for water there, and they kept murmuring against Moses and saying: \"Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our sons and our livestock with thirst?\" 4 Finally Moses cried out to Jehovah: \"What should I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me!\"\n5 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Go ahead of the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel and your rod with which you struck the Nile River. Take it in your hand and walk on. 6 Look! I will be standing before you there on the rock in Horeb. You must strike the rock, and water will come out of it, and the people will drink it.\" Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. 7 So he named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the Israelites and because they put Jehovah to the test by saying: \"Is Jehovah in our midst or not?\"\n8 Then the Amalekites came and fought against Israel in Rephidim. 9 At this Moses said to Joshua: \"Choose men for us and go out to fight against the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill, with the rod of the true God in my hand.\" 10 Then Joshua did just as Moses told him, and he fought against the Amalekites. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n11 As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up, the Israelites prevailed, but as soon as he would let down his hands, the Amalekites prevailed. 12 When the hands of Moses were heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur, one on each side, supported his hands, so that his hands remained steady until the sun set. 13 Thus Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.\n14 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Write this as a memorial in the book and repeat it to Joshua, 'I will completely wipe out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens.'\" 15 Then Moses built an altar and named it Jehovah-nissi, 16 saying: \"Because his hand is against the throne of Jah, Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.\"\nChapter 18\n1 Now Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, how Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt. 2 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken in Zipporah, Moses' wife, when she was sent back to him, 3 along with her two sons. One son was named Gershom, because Moses said, \"I have become a foreign resident in a foreign land,\" 4 and the other was named Eliezer, because he said, \"The God of my father is my helper, who rescued me from Pharaoh's sword.\"\n5 So Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, along with Moses' sons and his wife, came to Moses into the wilderness where he was camping at the mountain of the true God. 6 Then he sent word to Moses: \"I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.\" 7 At once Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him. Each of them asked about the other's welfare, and then they went into the tent.\n8 Moses related to his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and Egypt in behalf of Israel, all the hardships that had befallen them along the way, and how Jehovah had delivered them. 9 Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done for Israel by rescuing them from Egypt. 10 Then Jethro said: \"Praised be Jehovah, who rescued you from Egypt and from Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from under Egypt's control. 11 Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods, because of what he did to those who acted arrogantly against his people.\" 12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law before the true God.\n13 On the next day, Moses sat down as usual to serve as judge for the people, and the people kept standing before Moses from morning until evening. 14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said: \"What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit here alone with all the people standing before you from morning until evening?\" 15 Moses said to his father-in-law: \"Because the people keep coming to me to inquire of God. 16 When a case arises, it comes to me and I must judge between one person and the other, and I make known the decisions of the true God and his laws.\"\n17 Moses' father-in-law said to him: \"What you are doing is not good. 18 You will surely wear out, both you and this people who are with you, because this is too big a load for you and you cannot carry it by yourself. 19 Now listen to me. I will give you advice, and God will be with you. You serve as representative for the people before the true God, and you must bring the cases to the true God. 20 You should warn them about what the regulations and the laws are and make known to them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do. 21 But you should select from the people capable men fearing God, trustworthy men hating dishonest profit, and appoint these over them as chiefs over thousands, chiefs over hundreds, chiefs over fifties, and chiefs over tens. 22 They should judge the people when cases arise, and they will bring every difficult case to you, but every minor case they will decide. Make it easier for yourself by letting them share the load along with you. 23 If you do this, and God so commands you, you will be able to stand the strain, and everyone will go home satisfied.\"\n24 Moses immediately listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. 25 Moses chose capable men out of all Israel and appointed them heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens. 26 So they judged the people when cases arose. A difficult case they would bring to Moses, but every minor case they would judge. 27 After that Moses saw his father-in-law off, and he went his way to his land.\nChapter 19\n1 In the third month after the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the wilderness of Sinai. 2 They pulled away from Rephidim and came to the wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness. Israel camped there in front of the mountain.\n3 Then Moses went up to the true God, and Jehovah called to him from the mountain, saying: \"This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and to tell the Israelites, 4 'You have seen for yourselves what I did to the Egyptians, in order to carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself. 5 Now if you will strictly obey my voice and keep my covenant, you will certainly become my special property out of all peoples, for the whole earth belongs to me. 6 You will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you are to say to the Israelites.\"\n7 So Moses went and summoned the elders of the people and declared to them all these words that Jehovah had commanded him. 8 After that all the people answered unanimously: \"All that Jehovah has spoken, we are willing to do.\" Moses immediately took the people's response to Jehovah. 9 And Jehovah said to Moses: \"Look! I am coming to you in a dark cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they may always put faith in you as well.\" Then Moses reported the words of the people to Jehovah.\n10 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and they must wash their clothing. 11 And they must be ready for the third day, because on the third day Jehovah will come down upon Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people. 12 You must set boundaries for the people all around it and tell them, 'Beware of going up to the mountain or touching its border. Anybody touching the mountain will surely be put to death. 13 No hand is to touch him, but he will either be stoned or be shot through. Whether beast or man, he will not live.' But at the sound of the ram's horn they may come up to the mountain.\"\n14 Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and he began to sanctify the people, and they washed their clothing. 15 He said to the people: \"Get ready for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.\"\n16 On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning, and there was a heavy cloud on the mountain and a very loud sound of a horn, and all the people in the camp began to tremble. 17 Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true God, and they took their place at the base of the mountain. 18 Mount Sinai smoked all over, because Jehovah came down upon it in fire; and its smoke was rising like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling violently. 19 As the sound of the horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and the voice of the true God answered him.\n20 So Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain. Then Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. 21 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Go down and warn the people not to try to force their way through to look at Jehovah, or many of them will perish. 22 And let the priests who regularly come near to Jehovah sanctify themselves, so that Jehovah may not strike them.\" 23 Moses then said to Jehovah: \"The people are not able to come up to Mount Sinai because you already warned us, saying, 'Set boundaries around the mountain, and make it sacred.'\" 24 However, Jehovah said to him: \"Go, descend, and come back up, you and Aaron with you, but do not let the priests and the people force their way through to come up to Jehovah, so that he may not strike them.\" 25 So Moses descended to the people and told them.\nChapter 20\n1 Then God spoke all these words:\n2 \"I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 3 You must not have any other gods besides me.\n4 \"You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth. 5 You must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them, for I, Jehovah your God, am a God who requires exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n7 \"You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave unpunished the one who takes up His name in a worthless way.\n8 \"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it sacred. 9 You are to labor and do all your work for six days, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work, neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your domestic animal nor your foreign resident who is inside your settlements. 11 For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and he began to rest on the seventh day. That is why Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and made it sacred.\n12 \"Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live a long time in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.\n13 \"You must not murder.\n14 \"You must not commit adultery.\n15 \"You must not steal.\n16 \"You must not testify falsely when you are a witness against your fellow man.\n17 \"You must not desire your fellow man's house. You must not desire your fellow man's wife nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man.\"\n18 Now all the people were witnessing the thunder and lightning, the sound of the horn, and the mountain smoking; and seeing this made them tremble and stand at a distance. 19 So they said to Moses: \"You speak with us, and we will listen, but do not let God speak with us, for fear that we will die.\" 20 So Moses said to the people: \"Do not be afraid, for the true God has come to put you to the test, in order that the fear of him may continue with you so that you may not sin.\" 21 So the people kept standing at a distance, but Moses went near to the dark cloud where the true God was.\n22 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"This is what you are to say to the Israelites, 'You have seen for yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven. 23 You must not make gods of silver alongside me, and you must not make gods of gold for yourselves. 24 An altar of earth you are to make for me, and you will sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, your communion sacrifices, your flock, and your herd. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and I will bless you. 25 If you make an altar of stones for me, you must not build it using stones cut with tools. For if you do use your chisel on it, you will profane it. 26 And you must not go up by steps to my altar, that your private parts may not be exposed upon it.'\nChapter 21\n1 \"These are the judicial decisions that you are to convey to them:\n2 \"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve as a slave for six years, but in the seventh year, he will be set free without paying anything. 3 If he came by himself, he will go out by himself. If he is the husband of a wife, then his wife must go out with him. 4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will become her master's, and he will go out by himself. 5 But if the slave should insist and say, 'I love my master, my wife, and my sons; I do not want to be set free,' 6 his master must bring him before the true God. Then he will bring him up against the door or the doorpost, and his master will pierce his ear through with an awl, and he will be his slave for life.\n7 \"If a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not go free the same way that a slave man does. 8 If her master is not pleased with her and he does not designate her as a concubine but causes her to be purchased by someone else, he will not be entitled to sell her to foreigners, for he has betrayed her. 9 If he selects her for his son, he is to grant her the rights of a daughter. 10 If he takes another wife for himself, the sustenance, the clothing, and the marriage due of the first wife are not to be diminished. 11 If he will not render these three things to her, then she is to go free without paying any money.\n12 \"Anyone who strikes a man so that he dies must be put to death. 13 But if he does it unintentionally and the true God lets it happen, I will designate for you a place where he can flee. 14 If a man becomes very angry with his fellow man and he deliberately kills him, the man must die even if you have to take him from my altar. 15 One who strikes his father or his mother must be put to death.\n16 \"If anyone kidnaps a man and sells him or is caught holding him, he must be put to death.\n17 \"Anyone who curses his father or his mother must be put to death.\n18 \"This is what should happen if men quarrel and one strikes his fellow man with a stone or a fist and he does not die but is confined to his bed: 19 If he is able to get up and walk around outdoors with the aid of a staff, then the one who struck him must be free from punishment. He will only make compensation for the time the injured man lost from his work until he is completely healed.\n20 \"If a man strikes his slave man or his slave girl with a stick and that one dies by his hand, that one must be avenged. 21 However, if he survives for one or two days, he is not to be avenged, because he is someone bought with his owner's money.\n22 \"If men should struggle with each other and they hurt a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but no fatality results, the offender must pay the damages imposed on him by the husband of the woman; and he must pay it through the judges. 23 But if a fatality does occur, then you must give life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, blow for blow.\n26 \"If a man strikes the eye of his slave man or the eye of his slave girl and he destroys it, he is to let the slave go free in compensation for his eye. 27 And if he knocks out the tooth of his slave man or of his slave girl, he is to let the slave go free in compensation for his tooth.\n28 \"If a bull gores a man or a woman and that one dies, the bull must be stoned to death and its meat is not to be eaten; but the owner of the bull is free from punishment. 29 But if a bull was in the habit of goring and its owner had been warned but he would not keep it under guard and it killed a man or a woman, the bull is to be stoned and its owner is also to be put to death. 30 If a ransom is imposed on him, he must give as the redemption price for his life all that may be imposed on him. 31 Whether it gored a son or a daughter, it is to be done to the bull's owner according to this judicial decision. 32 If the bull gored a slave man or a slave girl, he will give the price of 30 shekels to that one's master, and the bull will be stoned to death.\n33 \"If a man uncovers or digs a pit and does not cover it and a bull or a donkey falls into it, 34 the owner of the pit is to make compensation. He is to pay the price to its owner, and the dead animal will become his. 35 If a man's bull hurts another's bull and it dies, then they must sell the live bull and divide the price paid for it; they should also divide the dead animal. 36 Or if it was known that a bull had been in the habit of goring but its owner would not keep it under guard, he must make compensation with bull for bull, and the dead one will become his own.\nChapter 22\n1 \"If a man steals a bull or a sheep and he slaughters or sells it, he is to compensate with five bulls for the bull and four sheep for the sheep.\n2 (\"If a thief is found in the act of breaking in and he gets struck and dies, there is no bloodguilt for him. 3 But if it happens after sunrise, there is bloodguilt for him.)\n\"He must make compensation. If he has nothing, then he must be sold for the things he stole. 4 If what he stole is found alive in his possession, whether it is a bull or a donkey or a sheep, he is to make double compensation.\n5 \"If anyone puts his animals out to graze in a field or a vineyard and lets them graze in someone else's field, he is to make compensation with the best of his own field or with the best of his own vineyard.\n6 \"If a fire starts and spreads to thornbushes and it causes sheaves or standing grain or a field to be consumed, the one who started the fire must make compensation for what was burned.\n7 \"If a man gives his fellow man money or articles to keep and these are stolen from the fellow man's house, if the thief is found, he must make double compensation. 8 If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must be brought before the true God in order to determine whether he put his hand on the goods of his fellow man. 9 In all cases of illegal possession of goods, concerning a bull, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or anything lost of which he may say, 'This is mine!' both parties will present their case before the true God. The one whom God pronounces guilty is to make double compensation to his fellow man.\n10 \"If a man gives his fellow man a donkey or a bull or a sheep or any domestic animal to keep and it dies or gets maimed or gets led away while nobody is looking, 11 there should be an oath made between them before Jehovah, that he did not lay his hand on the goods of his fellow man; and the owner must accept it. The other man is not to make compensation. 12 But if the animal has been stolen from him, he is to make compensation to its owner. 13 If it was torn by a wild animal, he is to bring it as evidence. He is not to make compensation for something torn by a wild animal.\n14 \"But if anybody asks to borrow an animal from his fellow man and it gets maimed or it dies while its owner is not with it, the man who borrowed it must make compensation. 15 If its owner is with it, he is not to make compensation. If it was hired, the money paid for the hire is the compensation.\n16 \"Now if a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and he lies down with her, he must pay the bride-price for her to become his wife. 17 If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he is to pay the money at the rate of the bride-price.\n18 \"You must not allow a sorceress to live.\n19 \"Anyone lying down with an animal must surely be put to death.\n20 \"Whoever sacrifices to any gods but Jehovah alone is to be devoted to destruction.\n21 \"You must not mistreat a foreign resident or oppress him, for you were foreign residents in the land of Egypt.\n22 \"You must not afflict any widow or fatherless child. 23 If you afflict him at all, so that he cries out to me, I will unfailingly hear his outcry; 24 and my anger will blaze, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will become widows, and your children will be fatherless.\n25 \"If you lend money to anyone poor of my people, someone who is dwelling with you, you must not become like a moneylender to him. You must not charge him interest.\n26 \"If you seize the garment of your fellow man as security for a loan, you are to return it to him by sunset. 27 For it is his only covering, his clothing to cover his body; in what will he lie down to sleep? When he cries out to me, I will certainly hear, for I am compassionate.\n28 \"You must not curse God nor curse a chieftain among your people.\n29 \"You must not hesitate to make offerings from your abundant produce and the overflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you are to give to me. 30 This is what you should do with your bull and your sheep: Seven days it will continue with its mother. On the eighth day, you are to give it to me.\n31 \"You should prove yourselves holy people to me, and you must not eat the flesh of anything in the field that has been torn by a wild animal. You should throw it to the dogs.\nChapter 23\n1 \"You must not spread a report that is not true. Do not cooperate with a wicked one by becoming a malicious witness. 2 You must not follow after the crowd to do evil, and you must not pervert justice by giving testimony to go along with the crowd. 3 You must show impartiality in the dispute of a poor person.\n4 \"If you come upon your enemy's bull or his donkey straying, you must return it to him. 5 If you see that the donkey of someone who hates you has fallen under its load, you must not ignore it and leave. You must help him release the animal.\n6 \"You are not to pervert the judgment of the poor one among you in his legal case.\n7 \"Have nothing to do with a false accusation, and do not kill the innocent and the righteous, for I will not declare the wicked one righteous.\n8 \"You must not accept a bribe, for the bribe blinds clear-sighted men and can distort the words of righteous men.\n9 \"You must not oppress a foreign resident. You know how it feels to be a foreigner, because you were foreign residents in the land of Egypt.\n10 \"You are to sow your land with seed and gather its produce for six years. 11 But the seventh year you should leave it uncultivated and let it lie fallow, and the poor among your people will eat of it, and what they leave, the wild animals of the field will eat. That is what you should do with your vineyard and your olive grove.\n12 \"Six days you are to do your work; but on the seventh day, you are to cease from your labor, in order that your bull and your donkey may rest and the son of your slave girl and the foreign resident may refresh themselves.\n13 \"You must be careful to do all that I have said to you, and you must not mention the names of other gods; they should not be heard on your lips.\n14 \"Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me. 15 You will observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You will eat unleavened bread for seven days, just as I have commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for at that time you came out of Egypt. No one is to appear before me empty-handed. 16 Also, you are to observe the Festival of Harvest of the first ripe fruits of your labors, of what you sow in the field; and the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in from the field the results of your labors. 17 Three times a year all your men are to appear before the true Lord, Jehovah.\n18 \"You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened. And the sacrifices of fat offered at my festivals should not stay overnight until the morning.\n19 \"You are to bring the best of the first ripe fruits of your ground to the house of Jehovah your God.\n\"You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.\n20 \"I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you on the way and to bring you into the place that I have prepared. 21 Pay attention to him, and obey his voice. Do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, because my name is in him. 22 However, if you strictly obey his voice and do all that I say, I will show hostility to your enemies and oppose those who oppose you. 23 For my angel will go ahead of you and will bring you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I will annihilate them. 24 You must not bow down to their gods or be persuaded to serve them, and you must not imitate their practices. Instead, you must demolish them and smash their sacred pillars. 25 You must serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless your bread and your water. I will remove sickness from among you. 26 The women in your land will not suffer a miscarriage or be barren, and I will give you a full life span.\n27 \"I will send the fear of me ahead of you, and I will throw into confusion all the people you encounter, and I will cause all your enemies to flee from you in defeat. 28 I will send the feeling of dejection ahead of you, and it will drive the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites out from before you. 29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year, so that the land does not become desolate and the wild animals of the field multiply against you. 30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land.\n31 \"I will set your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines and from the wilderness to the River; for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out from before you. 32 You must not make a covenant with them or their gods. 33 They should not dwell in your land, so that they may not cause you to sin against me. If you should serve their gods, it would surely become a snare to you.\"\nChapter 24\n1 Then he said to Moses: \"Go up to Jehovah, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of the elders of Israel, and bow down from a distance. 2 Moses should approach Jehovah by himself; but the others should not approach, and the people should not go up with him.\"\n3 Then Moses came and related to the people all the words of Jehovah and all the judicial decisions, and all the people answered with one voice: \"All the words that Jehovah has spoken, we are willing to do.\" 4 So Moses wrote down all the words of Jehovah. Then he got up early in the morning and built at the foot of the mountain an altar and 12 pillars corresponding to the 12 tribes of Israel. 5 After that he sent young Israelite men, and they offered up burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as communion sacrifices to Jehovah. 6 Then Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 7 Then he took the book of the covenant and read it aloud to the people. And they said: \"All that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do, and we will be obedient.\" 8 So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said: \"This is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has made with you in harmony with all these words.\"\n9 Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of the elders of Israel went up, 10 and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was what seemed like a sapphire pavement, and it was as pure as the heavens themselves. 11 He did not harm the distinguished men of Israel, and they saw a vision of the true God and ate and drank.\n12 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Come up to me on the mountain and stay there. I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment that I will write for their instruction.\" 13 So Moses got up with his attendant Joshua, and Moses went up the mountain of the true God. 14 But to the elders he had said: \"Wait here for us until we return to you. You have Aaron and Hur with you. Whoever has a legal case may go to them.\" 15 Then Moses went up the mountain while the cloud was covering it.\n16 Jehovah's glory remained on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 17 To the Israelites who were watching, the appearance of Jehovah's glory was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop. 18 Moses then entered into the cloud and went up the mountain. And Moses stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights.\nChapter 25\n1 Jehovah then said to Moses: 2 \"Tell the people of Israel to take up a contribution for me; from every person whose heart moves him, you are to take up my contribution. 3 This is the contribution that you are to accept from them: gold, silver, copper, 4 blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, 5 ram skins dyed red, sealskins, acacia wood, 6 oil for the lamps, balsam for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense, 7 and onyx stones and other stones to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece. 8 They are to make a sanctuary for me, and I will reside among them. 9 You are to make it, the tabernacle and all its furnishings, following exactly the pattern that I am showing you.\n10 \"They are to make an ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high. 11 Then you will overlay it with pure gold. Inside and outside you are to overlay it, and you will make a border of gold all around it. 12 And you will cast four rings of gold for it and attach them above its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other side. 13 And you will make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 14 You will put the poles through the rings on the sides of the Ark in order to carry the Ark with them. 15 The poles will stay in the rings of the Ark; they are not to be removed from it. 16 You will place in the Ark the Testimony that I will give you.\n17 \"You will make a cover of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 18 You are to make two cherubs of gold; you will make them of hammered work on the two ends of the cover. 19 Make the cherubs on the two ends, one cherub on each end of the cover. 20 The cherubs are to spread out their two wings upward, overshadowing the cover with their wings, and they will face each other. The faces of the cherubs will be turned toward the cover. 21 You will put the cover on the Ark, and in the Ark you will place the Testimony that I will give you. 22 I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover. From between the two cherubs that are on the ark of the Testimony, I will make known to you all that I will command you for the Israelites.\n23 \"You will also make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high. 24 You will overlay it with pure gold and make a golden border around it. 25 You will make a rim around it a handbreadth wide and a border of gold to go around the rim. 26 You will make for it four rings of gold and place the rings on the four corners, where the four legs are attached. 27 The rings are to be close to the rim as holders for the poles for carrying the table. 28 You will make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold and carry the table with them.\n29 \"You will also make its dishes, its cups, and its pitchers and bowls from which they will pour drink offerings. You are to make them out of pure gold. 30 And you will put the showbread on the table before me constantly.\n31 \"You will make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand is to be made of hammered work. Its base, its stem, its branches, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms will be one piece. 32 And six branches will extend out from the sides of the lampstand, three branches from one side and three branches from the other side. 33 Three cups shaped like almond flowers will be on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like almond flowers on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. This is how the six branches will extend out from the stem of the lampstand. 34 On the stem of the lampstand are four cups shaped like almond flowers, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating. 35 A knob will be under the first two branches that extend out of the stem and a knob under the next two branches and a knob under the next two branches, for the six branches extending out from the stem. 36 The knobs and the branches and the whole lampstand are to be one piece of pure, hammered gold. 37 You will make seven lamps for it, and when the lamps are lit, they will shine on the area in front of it. 38 Its snuffers and its fire holders are to be of pure gold. 39 It should be made, along with these utensils, from a talent of pure gold. 40 See that you make them after their pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.\nChapter 26\n1 \"You are to make the tabernacle with ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen, blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material. You are to make them with embroidered cherub designs. 2 Each tent cloth will be 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. All the tent cloths are to be the same size. 3 Five tent cloths are to be joined one to another to form a series, and the other five tent cloths will be joined in a series. 4 You will make loops of blue thread on the edge of the one tent cloth at the end of the series, and you are to do the same on the outermost edge of the other set where it will join. 5 You will make 50 loops on the one tent cloth and 50 loops on the edge of the other tent cloth so that they will be opposite each other where they join. 6 You are to make 50 gold clasps and join the tent cloths together with the clasps, and the tabernacle will form one unit.\n7 \"You will also make cloths of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle. You will make 11 tent cloths. 8 Each tent cloth will be 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. All 11 tent cloths are to be the same size. 9 You are to join five of the tent cloths together and join the other six tent cloths together, and you are to fold over the sixth tent cloth at the front of the tent. 10 And you are to make 50 loops on the edge of the one tent cloth, the outermost one in the series, and 50 loops on the edge of the tent cloth at the other place where they join. 11 You are to make 50 copper clasps and put the clasps in the loops and join the tent together, and it will become one unit. 12 The remaining part of the tent cloths will serve as an overhanging. Half of the tent cloth that remains will hang over the back of the tabernacle. 13 The remaining length of the cloths of the tent will serve as an overhanging for the tabernacle by one cubit on each side, in order to cover it.\n14 \"You will also make a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red and over that a covering of sealskins.\n15 \"You will make the panel frames for the tabernacle out of acacia wood standing upright. 16 Each panel frame is to be ten cubits high and a cubit and a half wide. 17 Each panel frame has two tenons joined to each other. That is how you should make all the panel frames of the tabernacle. 18 You are to make 20 panel frames for the south side of the tabernacle, facing south.\n19 \"You will make 40 silver socket pedestals under the 20 panel frames: two socket pedestals under the one panel frame for its two tenons and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame for its two tenons. 20 For the other side of the tabernacle, the northern side, make 20 panel frames 21 and their 40 silver socket pedestals, two socket pedestals under one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame. 22 For the rear section of the tabernacle to the west, you will make six panel frames. 23 You will make two panel frames to serve as the two rear corner posts of the tabernacle. 24 They should be doubled from the bottom to the top, up to the first ring. This should be done for both of them, and they will form the two corner posts. 25 And there will be eight panel frames and their 16 silver socket pedestals, two socket pedestals under the one panel frame and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame.\n26 \"You will make bars of acacia wood, five for the panel frames of the one side of the tabernacle, 27 and five bars for the panel frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the panel frames of the side of the tabernacle to the west, for the rear section. 28 The middle bar that runs along the center of the panel frames should extend from end to end.\n29 \"You will overlay the panel frames with gold, and you will make their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and you will overlay the bars with gold. 30 You must set up the tabernacle according to its plan that you were shown in the mountain.\n31 \"You are to make a curtain of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. It will be made with cherubs embroidered on it. 32 You will hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold. Their hooks are to be of gold. The pillars are set on four socket pedestals of silver. 33 You will hang the curtain under the clasps and bring the ark of the Testimony there within the curtain. The curtain will make a division for you between the Holy and the Most Holy. 34 You must put the cover on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy.\n35 \"You will place the table outside the curtain, with the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle; and the table you will put on the north side. 36 You will make a screen for the entrance of the tent out of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen woven together. 37 You will make five pillars of acacia for the screen and overlay them with gold. Their hooks are to be of gold, and you will cast five socket pedestals of copper for them.\nChapter 27\n1 \"You will make the altar of acacia wood; it will be five cubits long and five cubits wide. The altar should be square and three cubits high. 2 You will make horns on its four corners; the horns will be part of the altar, and you will overlay the altar with copper. 3 You will make buckets for clearing away its ashes, along with shovels, bowls, forks, and fire holders, and you will make all its utensils of copper. 4 You will make a grating for the altar, a network of copper, and on the network four rings of copper at its four corners. 5 You will set it down below the rim of the altar, and the network will extend partway down into the altar. 6 You will make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with copper. 7 The poles will be inserted into the rings so that the poles are on the two sides of the altar when it is carried. 8 You will make the altar in the form of a hollow chest of planks. It should be made just as He showed you on the mountain.\n9 \"You will make the courtyard of the tabernacle. For the south side, facing south, the courtyard will have hanging curtains of fine twisted linen, 100 cubits long for the one side. 10 It will have 20 pillars with 20 copper socket pedestals. The hooks of the pillars and their connectors are of silver. 11 The hanging curtains for the north side will also be 100 cubits long, along with its 20 pillars and their 20 copper socket pedestals, with silver hooks and connectors for the pillars. 12 There are to be hanging curtains on the west side for 50 cubits across the width of the courtyard, with ten pillars and ten socket pedestals. 13 The width of the courtyard on the east side toward the sunrise is 50 cubits. 14 There will be 15 cubits of hanging curtains on the one side, with three pillars and three socket pedestals. 15 And for the other side, there will be 15 cubits of hanging curtains, with three pillars and three socket pedestals.\n16 \"The entrance of the courtyard should have a screen 20 cubits long made of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen woven together, with four pillars and their four socket pedestals. 17 All the pillars surrounding the courtyard will have silver fasteners and silver hooks, but their socket pedestals will be of copper. 18 The courtyard is to be 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 5 cubits high, made from fine twisted linen, and it should have copper socket pedestals. 19 All the utensils and the items used in the service of the tabernacle, as well as its tent pins and all the pins of the courtyard, are to be of copper.\n20 \"You are to command the Israelites to bring you pure, beaten olive oil for the lighting, in order to keep the lamps burning constantly. 21 In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain that is near the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will arrange to keep the lamps lit from evening until morning before Jehovah. It is a lasting statute for all their generations to be carried out by the Israelites.\nChapter 28\n1 \"You are to summon from the Israelites your brother Aaron, along with his sons, so that he may serve as priest to me-Aaron, along with Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron. 2 You are to make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and beauty. 3 You are to speak to all those who are skillful, those whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, and they will make Aaron's garments for his sanctification, so that he may serve as priest to me.\n4 \"These are the garments that they will make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a sleeveless coat, a checkered robe, a turban, and a sash; they will make these holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so that he may serve as priest to me. 5 The skilled workers will use the gold, the blue thread, the purple wool, the scarlet material, and the fine linen.\n6 \"They are to make the ephod of gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, and it should be embroidered. 7 It is to have two shoulder pieces that are joined at the two top edges. 8 The woven belt, which is attached to the ephod for tying it securely in position, should be of the same materials: gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen.\n9 \"You are to take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel, 10 six names on the one stone and the six remaining names on the other stone, in the order of their births. 11 A stone engraver will engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones as he would engrave a seal. Then you are to have them mounted in gold settings. 12 You are to put the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, and Aaron must carry their names before Jehovah on his two shoulder pieces as a memorial. 13 You are to make settings of gold 14 and two chains of pure gold twisted like a cord, and you must attach the corded chains to the settings.\n15 \"You are to have an embroiderer make the breastpiece of judgment. It should be made like the ephod, out of gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. 16 It should be square when doubled, a span long and a span wide. 17 You should set in it mounted stones, four rows of stones. The first row is ruby, topaz, and emerald. 18 The second row is turquoise, sapphire, and jasper. 19 The third row is leshem stone, agate, and amethyst. 20 The fourth row is chrysolite, onyx, and jade. They should be mounted in settings of gold. 21 The stones will correspond to the names of the 12 sons of Israel. Each one should be engraved like a seal, each name representing one of the 12 tribes.\n22 \"You are to make wreathed chains on the breastpiece, like cords of pure gold. 23 You are to make two rings of gold for the breastpiece and attach the two rings to the two ends of the breastpiece. 24 You are to put the two cords of gold through the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece. 25 You will put the two ends of the two cords through the two settings, and you must attach them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod, at the front. 26 You are to make two rings of gold and set them at the two ends on the inside edge of the breastpiece, facing the ephod. 27 You should make two more rings of gold on the front of the ephod, below the two shoulder pieces, close to where it is joined, above the woven belt of the ephod. 28 The breastpiece should be held in place by a blue cord, tying its rings to the rings of the ephod. This will keep the breastpiece in place on the ephod, above the woven belt.\n29 \"Aaron must carry the names of the sons of Israel on the breastpiece of judgment over his heart when he comes into the Holy as a constant memorial before Jehovah. 30 You will put the Urim and the Thummim into the breastpiece of judgment, and they must be over Aaron's heart when he comes in before Jehovah, and Aaron must carry the means for making judgments of the Israelites over his heart before Jehovah constantly.\n31 \"You are to make the sleeveless coat of the ephod entirely of blue thread. 32 There will be an opening at the top in the middle of it. Its opening should have a border woven all around it by a loom worker. It should be like the opening of a coat of mail, so that it will not be torn. 33 You should make pomegranates of blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material all around its hem, along with bells of gold in between them. 34 You should alternate a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the sleeveless coat. 35 It must be worn by Aaron so that he may minister, and the sound from it must be heard when he goes into the sanctuary before Jehovah and when he comes out, so that he will not die.\n36 \"You are to make a shining plate of pure gold and engrave on it as one would engrave a seal: 'Holiness belongs to Jehovah.' 37 You must fasten it to the turban with a blue cord; it is to remain on the front of the turban. 38 It will be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron will bear responsibility when someone commits an error against the holy things, which the Israelites sanctify when they offer them as holy gifts. It must always remain on his forehead, so that they may gain approval before Jehovah.\n39 \"You are to weave the checkered robe of fine linen, make a turban of fine linen, and make a woven sash.\n40 \"You will also make robes, sashes, and headgear for Aaron's sons, for glory and beauty. 41 You will clothe your brother Aaron and his sons with him, and you are to anoint them and install them and sanctify them, and they will serve as priests to me. 42 Also make linen shorts for them to cover their naked flesh. These are to extend from the hips to the thighs. 43 These must be worn by Aaron and his sons when they come into the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place, so that they may not incur guilt and die. It is a permanent statute for him and his offspring after him.\nChapter 29\n1 \"This is what you are to do to sanctify them to serve as priests to me: Take a young bull, two unblemished rams, 2 unleavened bread, unleavened ring-shaped loaves mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil. You are to make them with fine wheat flour 3 and put them in a basket and present them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams.\n4 \"You will present Aaron and his sons at the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water. 5 Then you are to take the garments and clothe Aaron with the robe, the sleeveless coat of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastpiece, and you are to tie the woven belt of the ephod securely around his waist. 6 You will put the turban on his head and put the holy sign of dedication on the turban; 7 and take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.\n8 \"Then bring his sons forward and clothe them with the robes 9 and wrap the sashes around them, Aaron as well as his sons, and put on their headgear; and the priesthood will become theirs as a permanent statute. This is how you should install Aaron and his sons to serve as priests.\n10 \"You are now to present the bull before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons will lay their hands on the bull's head. 11 Slaughter the bull before Jehovah, at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 12 Take some of the bull's blood on your finger and put it on the horns of the altar, and pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 13 Then take all the fat that covers the intestines, the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn them so that they smoke on the altar. 14 But the bull's flesh and its skin and its dung, you will burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.\n15 \"Then take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the ram's head. 16 Slaughter the ram and take its blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar. 17 Cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its intestines and its shanks, and arrange the pieces together with its head. 18 You must burn the entire ram, making it smoke on the altar. It is a burnt offering to Jehovah, a pleasing aroma. It is an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\n19 \"Next you are to take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands on the ram's head. 20 Slaughter the ram and take some of its blood and put it on Aaron's right earlobe and on his sons' right earlobe and on the thumb of their right hand and the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar. 21 Then take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil and spatter it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and his sons' garments, so that he and his garments and his sons and their garments may be holy.\n22 \"Then take from the ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat that covers the intestines, the appendage of the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and the right leg, for it is a ram of installation. 23 Take also a round loaf of bread and a ring-shaped loaf of oiled bread and a wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Jehovah. 24 You must place them all in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and you are to wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 25 Then you will take them out of their hands and burn them on the altar, on top of the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before Jehovah. It is an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\n26 \"Then take the breast of the ram of installation, which is offered in behalf of Aaron, and wave it back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah, and it will become your portion. 27 You are to sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion that was waved and that was taken from the ram of installation, from what was offered for Aaron and for his sons. 28 It is to become Aaron's and his sons' by a permanent regulation to be carried out by the Israelites, for it is a sacred portion, and it will become a sacred portion to be given by the Israelites. It is their sacred portion for Jehovah from their communion sacrifices.\n29 \"The holy garments that belong to Aaron will be used by his sons after him when they are anointed and installed as priests. 30 The priest from among his sons who succeeds him and who comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place will wear them for seven days.\n31 \"You will take the ram of installation and boil its flesh in a holy place. 32 Aaron and his sons will eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 33 They are to eat the things with which atonement was made to install them as priests and to sanctify them. But an unauthorized person may not eat them, for they are something holy. 34 If any of the flesh of the installation sacrifice and of the bread is left over until the morning, then you must burn what is left with fire. It must not be eaten, for it is something holy.\n35 \"You are to do this way to Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. You will take seven days to install them as priests. 36 You will offer the bull of the sin offering daily for an atonement, and you are to purify the altar from sin by making atonement for it, and you must anoint it to sanctify it. 37 You will take seven days to make atonement for the altar, and you must sanctify it so that it may become a most holy altar. Anyone who touches the altar is to be holy.\n38 \"This is what you will offer on the altar: two one year old rams each day, continually. 39 Offer the one young ram in the morning and the other ram at twilight. 40 A tenth part of an ephah measure of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a drink offering of a fourth of a hin of wine, will go for the first young ram. 41 You will offer the second young ram at twilight, along with the same grain and drink offerings as in the morning. You will render it as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 42 It is to be a regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will present myself to you to speak to you there.\n43 \"I will present myself there to the Israelites, and it will be sanctified by my glory. 44 I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar, and I will sanctify Aaron and his sons so that they may serve as priests to me. 45 I will reside among the people of Israel, and I will be their God. 46 And they will certainly know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I may reside among them. I am Jehovah their God.\nChapter 30\n1 \"You are to make an altar as a place for burning incense; you will make it of acacia wood. 2 It should be square, one cubit long, one cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns will be one piece with it. 3 You are to overlay it with pure gold: its top surface, its sides all around, and its horns; and you are to make a gold border around it. 4 You will also make two rings of gold for it below its border on two opposite sides, and these will hold the poles used to carry it. 5 Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. 6 You are to put it before the curtain that is near the ark of the Testimony, before the cover that is over the Testimony, where I will present myself to you.\n7 \"Aaron will burn perfumed incense on it, making it smoke on the altar when he maintains the lamps each morning. 8 Also, when Aaron lights the lamps at twilight, he will burn the incense. It is a regular incense offering before Jehovah throughout your generations. 9 You must not offer on it unauthorized incense or a burnt offering or a grain offering, and you must not pour a drink offering on it. 10 Aaron must make atonement on its horns once a year. With some of the blood of the sin offering of the atonement, he will make atonement for it once a year throughout your generations. It is most holy to Jehovah.\"\n11 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 12 \"Whenever you take a census and count the sons of Israel, each one must give a ransom for his life to Jehovah at the time of the census. This is so that no plague may be brought upon them when they are registered. 13 This is what all those who are registered will give: a half shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place. Twenty gerahs equal a shekel. A half shekel is the contribution to Jehovah. 14 Everyone registered who is 20 years old and up will give Jehovah's contribution. 15 The rich should not give more and the poor should not give less than the half shekel as a contribution to Jehovah to make atonement for your lives. 16 You are to take the silver money of the atonement from the Israelites and give it in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting, that it may serve as a remembrance before Jehovah for the Israelites, to make atonement for your lives.\"\n17 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 18 \"Make a copper basin and its stand for washing; then place it between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water into it. 19 Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and their feet there. 20 When they go into the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar to minister and to make offerings of fire and smoke to Jehovah, they will wash with water so that they do not die. 21 They must wash their hands and their feet so that they may not die, and it must serve as a permanent regulation for them, for him and his offspring, throughout their generations.\"\n22 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses: 23 \"Next, take the choicest perfumes: 500 units of solidified myrrh, and half that amount, 250 units, of sweet cinnamon, 250 units of sweet calamus, 24 and 500 units of cassia, measured by the standard shekel of the holy place, along with a hin of olive oil. 25 Then make out of it a holy anointing oil; it should be skillfully blended together. It is to be a holy anointing oil.\n26 \"You are to anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the Testimony with it, 27 as well as the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 28 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand. 29 You must sanctify them that they may become most holy. Anyone touching them is to be holy. 30 And you will anoint Aaron and his sons and sanctify them to serve as priests to me.\n31 \"You will speak to the Israelites, saying, 'This is to continue as a holy anointing oil to me during your generations. 32 It is not to be applied to the flesh of mankind, and you must not make anything with a composition like it. It is something holy. It is to continue as something holy for you. 33 Anyone who makes an ointment like it and who puts some of it on an unauthorized person must be cut off from his people.'\"\n34 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Take equal portions of these perfumes: stacte drops, onycha, perfumed galbanum, and pure frankincense. 35 Make it into an incense; the spice mixture should be skillfully blended, salted, pure, and holy. 36 You are to pound some of it into fine powder and put some of it before the Testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will present myself to you. It should be most holy to you. 37 You must not make for your own use the incense that you make with this composition. You are to regard it as something holy to Jehovah. 38 Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its smell must be cut off from his people.\"\nChapter 31\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 \"See, I have chosen Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah. 3 I will fill him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge of every kind of craftsmanship, 4 for making artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper, 5 for cutting and setting stones, and for making every kind of wood product. 6 Moreover, to assist him I have appointed Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, and I am putting wisdom into the heart of all those who are skillful, so that they may make everything I have commanded you: 7 the tent of meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the cover that is on it, all the equipment of the tent, 8 the table and its utensils, the lampstand of pure gold and all its utensils, the altar of incense, 9 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin and its stand, 10 the finely woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to serve as priests, 11 the anointing oil, and the perfumed incense for the sanctuary. They will do everything I have commanded you.\"\n12 Jehovah said further to Moses: 13 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'Especially, you are to keep my sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you during your generations in order that you may know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you. 14 You must keep the Sabbath, for it is something holy to you. Whoever profanes it must be put to death. If anyone does any work on it, then that person must be cut off from among his people. 15 Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest. It is something holy to Jehovah. Anyone doing work on the Sabbath day must be put to death. 16 The Israelites must keep the Sabbath; they must observe the Sabbath during all their generations. It is a lasting covenant. 17 It is an enduring sign between me and the people of Israel, for in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he rested and refreshed himself.'\"\n18 Now as soon as he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone written on by God's finger.\nChapter 32\n1 Meanwhile, the people saw that Moses was taking a long time coming down from the mountain. So the people gathered around Aaron and said to him: \"Get up, make for us a god who will go ahead of us, because we do not know what has happened to this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt.\" 2 At this Aaron said to them: \"Take the gold earrings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring them to me.\" 3 So all the people began taking off the gold earrings that were in their ears and bringing them to Aaron. 4 Then he took the gold from them, and he formed it with an engraving tool and made it into a statue of a calf. They began to say: \"This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.\"\n5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. Then Aaron called out: \"There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.\" 6 So they got up early on the next day and began offering up burnt offerings and presenting communion sacrifices. After that the people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to have a good time.\n7 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Go, descend, because your people, whom you led up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. 8 They have quickly deviated from the way I commanded them to go. They have made for themselves a statue of a calf, and they keep bowing down to it and sacrificing to it and saying, 'This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.'\" 9 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: \"I have seen that this is an obstinate people. 10 So now let me be, and I will exterminate them in my burning anger, and let me make a great nation from you instead.\"\n11 Then Moses appealed to Jehovah his God and said: \"Why, O Jehovah, should you turn your burning anger against your people after bringing them out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'He had evil intentions when he led them out. He wanted to kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the surface of the earth'? Turn from your burning anger and reconsider your decision to bring this calamity on your people. 13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom you swore by yourself and said: 'I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the heavens, and I will give all this land that I have designated to your offspring, so that they may take it as a permanent possession.'\"\n14 So Jehovah began to reconsider the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on his people.\n15 Moses then turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand. The tablets were inscribed on both sides; they were written on the front and on the back. 16 The tablets were the workmanship of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets. 17 When Joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting, he said to Moses: \"There is the sound of battle in the camp.\" 18 But Moses said:\n\"It is not the sound of singing over a victory,\nAnd it is not the sound of wailing over a defeat;\nI hear the sound of another kind of singing.\"\n19 As soon as Moses got near the camp and saw the calf and the dances, his anger began to blaze, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain. 20 He took the calf that they had made and he burned it with fire and crushed it into powder; then he scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it. 21 And Moses said to Aaron: \"What did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?\" 22 Aaron replied: \"Do not be enraged, my lord. You well know that the people are inclined to do evil. 23 So they said to me, 'Make for us a god who will go ahead of us, for we do not know what has happened to this Moses, the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt.' 24 So I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold must take it off and give it to me.' Then I threw it into the fire and out came this calf.\"\n25 Moses saw that the people were unrestrained, for Aaron had let them go unrestrained, so that they were a disgrace before their opposers. 26 Then Moses took his position in the gate of the camp and said: \"Who is on Jehovah's side? Come to me!\" And all the Levites gathered around him. 27 He now said to them: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, 'Each of you must fasten on his sword and pass through all the camp from gate to gate, killing his brother, his neighbor, and his close companion.'\" 28 The Levites did what Moses said. So about 3,000 men were killed on that day. 29 Then Moses said: \"Set yourselves apart for Jehovah today, for each of you has gone against his own son and his own brother; today he will give you a blessing.\"\n30 On the very next day, Moses said to the people: \"You committed a very great sin, and now I will go up to Jehovah to see if I can make amends for your sin.\" 31 So Moses returned to Jehovah and said: \"What a great sin this people has committed! They made themselves a god of gold! 32 But now if you are willing, pardon their sin; if not, please wipe me out from your book that you have written.\" 33 However, Jehovah said to Moses: \"Whoever has sinned against me, I will wipe him out of my book. 34 Go now, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you. Look! My angel will go ahead of you, and on the day when I make an accounting, I will bring punishment on them for their sin.\" 35 Then Jehovah began plaguing the people because they had made the calf, the one that Aaron had made.\nChapter 33\n1 Jehovah said further to Moses: \"Go on your way from here with the people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt. Journey to the land about which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.' 2 I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 3 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go in the midst of you, for you are an obstinate people, and I might exterminate you on the way.\"\n4 When the people heard this harsh word, they began to mourn, and not one of them put on his ornaments. 5 Jehovah said to Moses: \"Say to the Israelites, 'You are an obstinate people. In one moment I could go through the midst of you and exterminate you. So now keep your ornaments off while I consider what to do to you.'\" 6 So from Mount Horeb onward, the Israelites refrained from wearing their ornaments.\n7 Now Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, at some distance from the camp, and he called it a tent of meeting. Everyone inquiring of Jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp. 8 As soon as Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of their own tents, and they would gaze after Moses until he entered into the tent. 9 As soon as Moses would go into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance of the tent while God spoke with Moses. 10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, each of them rose and bowed down at the entrance of his own tent. 11 Jehovah spoke to Moses face-to-face, just as one man would speak to another man. When he returned to the camp, Joshua the son of Nun, his minister and attendant, would not depart from the tent.\n12 Now Moses said to Jehovah: \"See, you are saying to me, 'Lead this people up,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Moreover, you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my eyes.' 13 Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, make me know your ways, so that I may know you and continue to find favor in your eyes. Consider, too, that this nation is your people.\" 14 So he said: \"I myself will go with you, and I will give you rest.\" 15 Then Moses said to him: \"If you yourself are not going along, do not lead us up from here. 16 How will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going along with us, so that I and your people will be distinguished from every other people on the face of the earth?\"\n17 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: \"I will also do this thing that you request, because you have found favor in my eyes and I know you by name.\" 18 Then he said: \"Please show me your glory.\" 19 But he said: \"I will make all my goodness pass before your face, and I will declare before you the name of Jehovah; and I will favor the one whom I favor, and I will show mercy to the one to whom I show mercy.\" 20 But he added: \"You cannot see my face, for no man can see me and live.\"\n21 Jehovah said further: \"Here is a place near me. Station yourself on the rock. 22 When my glory is passing by, I will place you in a crevice of the rock, and I will shield you with my hand until I have passed by. 23 After that I will take my hand away, and you will see my back. But my face may not be seen.\"\nChapter 34\n1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets, which you shattered. 2 Get ready for the morning, as you will go up in the morning to Mount Sinai and station yourself before me there on the top of the mountain. 3 But nobody may go up with you, and nobody else should be seen anywhere on the mountain. Not even the flocks or herds should graze in front of that mountain.\"\n4 So Moses carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and got up early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, just as Jehovah had commanded him, and he took the two tablets of stone in his hand. 5 Then Jehovah came down in the cloud and stationed himself with him there and declared the name of Jehovah. 6 Jehovah was passing before him and declaring: \"Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth, 7 showing loyal love to thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons and upon grandsons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.\"\n8 Moses hurried to bow low to the earth and prostrate himself. 9 Then he said: \"If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, O Jehovah, then please, Jehovah, go along with us in our midst, although we are an obstinate people, and forgive our error and our sin, and take us as your own possession.\" 10 In turn he said: \"Here I am making a covenant: Before all your people, I will do wonderful things that have never been done in all the earth or among all the nations, and all the people among whom you live will see the work of Jehovah, for it is an awe-inspiring thing that I am doing with you.\n11 \"Pay attention to what I am commanding you today. Here I am driving out from before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 12 Be careful that you do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it may prove to be a snare among you. 13 But you are to pull down their altars, you are to shatter their sacred pillars, and their sacred poles you are to cut down. 14 You must not bow down to another god, for Jehovah is known for requiring exclusive devotion. Yes, he is a God who requires exclusive devotion. 15 Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, because when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone will invite you and you will eat from his sacrifice. 16 Then you will surely take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves to their gods.\n17 \"You must not make gods of cast metal.\n18 \"You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. You will eat unleavened bread, just as I have commanded you; do this for seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, because it was in the month of Abib that you came out of Egypt.\n19 \"Every firstborn male is mine, including all your livestock, whether the first male bull or sheep. 20 The firstling of a donkey you are to redeem with a sheep. But if you do not redeem it, then you must break its neck. You are to redeem every firstborn of your sons. No one may appear before me empty-handed.\n21 \"Six days you are to work, but on the seventh day you will rest. Even during plowing time and in harvest, you will rest.\n22 \"And you will celebrate your Festival of Weeks with the first ripe fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.\n23 \"Three times a year, all your men are to appear before the true Lord, Jehovah, the God of Israel. 24 For I will drive the nations away from before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of Jehovah your God three times a year.\n25 \"You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice along with anything leavened. The sacrifice of the festival of the Passover should not be kept overnight until the morning.\n26 \"The best of the first ripe fruits of your soil you are to bring to the house of Jehovah your God.\n\"You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.\"\n27 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: \"You are to write down these words, because in accordance with these words, I am making a covenant with you and with Israel.\" 28 And he remained there with Jehovah 40 days and 40 nights. He ate no bread and drank no water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.\n29 Moses then came down from Mount Sinai, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand. When he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face was emitting rays because he had been speaking with God. 30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, they noticed that the skin of his face emitted rays and they were afraid to go near him.\n31 But Moses called to them, so Aaron and all the chieftains of the assembly came to him, and Moses spoke with them. 32 After that all the Israelites came near to him, and he gave them all the commands that Jehovah had given him on Mount Sinai. 33 When Moses would finish speaking with them, he would put a veil over his face. 34 But when Moses would go in before Jehovah to speak with him, he would take off the veil until he went out. Then he went out and revealed to the Israelites the commands he had received. 35 And the Israelites saw that the skin of Moses' face emitted rays; then Moses put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with God.\nChapter 35\n1 Moses later gathered the entire assembly of the Israelites together and said to them: \"These are the things that Jehovah has commanded to be done: 2 Work may be done for six days, but the seventh day will become something holy to you, a sabbath of complete rest to Jehovah. Anybody doing work on it will be put to death. 3 You must not light a fire in any of your dwelling places on the Sabbath day.\"\n4 Moses then said to the entire assembly of the Israelites: \"This is what Jehovah has commanded, 5 'Take up a contribution for Jehovah from among yourselves. Let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution for Jehovah: gold, silver, copper, 6 blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, 7 ram skins dyed red, sealskins, acacia wood, 8 oil for the lamps, balsam for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense, 9 onyx stones, and other stones for setting in the ephod and the breastpiece.\n10 \"'Let all who are skilled among you come and make everything that Jehovah has commanded, 11 namely, the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, its clasps and its panel frames, its bars, its pillars, and its socket pedestals; 12 the Ark and its poles, the cover, and the curtain for the screen; 13 the table and its poles and all its utensils and the showbread; 14 the lampstand for light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for lighting; 15 the altar of incense and its poles; the anointing oil and the perfumed incense; the screen for the tabernacle's entrance; 16 the altar of burnt offering and its copper grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin and its stand; 17 the hanging curtains of the courtyard, its pillars and its socket pedestals; the screen of the entrance to the courtyard; 18 the tent pins of the tabernacle and the tent pins of the courtyard and their cords; 19 the finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons for serving as priests.'\"\n20 So all the assembly of the Israelites went out from before Moses. 21 Then everyone whose heart impelled him and everyone whose spirit incited him came and brought their contribution for Jehovah to be used for the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments. 22 They kept coming, the men along with the women, each with a willing heart, bringing brooches, earrings, rings, and other jewelry, as well as all sorts of articles of gold. They all presented their offerings of gold to Jehovah. 23 And all who had blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, and sealskins brought them. 24 All those contributing silver and copper brought Jehovah's contribution, and all who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.\n25 All the skilled women spun with their hands, and they brought what they had spun: blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine linen. 26 And all the skilled women whose hearts impelled them spun the goat hair.\n27 And the chieftains brought onyx stones and other stones to be set in the ephod and the breastpiece, 28 and the balsam and the oil for lighting and for the anointing oil and for the perfumed incense. 29 All the men and women whose hearts incited them brought something for the work that Jehovah, through Moses, had commanded to be done; the Israelites brought it as a voluntary offering to Jehovah.\n30 Then Moses said to the Israelites: \"See, Jehovah has chosen Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah. 31 He has filled him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship 32 for making artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper, 33 for cutting and setting stones, and for making all kinds of artistic wood products. 34 And he has put it into his heart to teach, he and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan. 35 He has filled them with skill to do all the work of a craftsman, an embroiderer, and a weaver using blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine linen, and of a loom worker. These men will do every sort of work and prepare every sort of design.\nChapter 36\n1 \"Bezalel will work along with Oholiab and every skilled man to whom Jehovah has given wisdom and understanding so as to know how to do all the work of the holy service just as Jehovah has commanded.\"\n2 Moses then called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled man into whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, everyone whose heart impelled him to volunteer to do the work. 3 Then they took from Moses all the contribution that the Israelites had brought for the work of the holy service. However, these continued to bring him voluntary offerings, morning after morning.\n4 Then after they started the holy work, all the skilled workers were coming, one after another, 5 and they were telling Moses: \"The people are bringing much more than what is required for the work that Jehovah has commanded to be done.\" 6 So Moses commanded that an announcement be made throughout the camp, saying: \"Men and women, do not bring any more goods for the holy contribution.\" With that the people were restrained from bringing in anything else. 7 The goods were enough for all the work to be done, and more than enough.\n8 So all the skilled workers made the tabernacle of ten tent cloths of fine twisted linen, blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material; he made them with cherubs embroidered on them. 9 Each tent cloth was 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. All the tent cloths were the same size. 10 Then he joined five of the tent cloths together, and the other five tent cloths he joined together. 11 After that he made loops of blue thread on the edge of the one tent cloth where it would join. He did the same on the edge of the outermost tent cloth at the corresponding place where it would join. 12 He made 50 loops on the one tent cloth and 50 loops on the other edge of the tent cloth at the place where it would join so that the loops would be opposite one another. 13 Finally, he made 50 gold clasps and joined the tent cloths together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle became one unit.\n14 Then he made tent cloths of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle. He made 11 tent cloths. 15 Each tent cloth was 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide. The 11 tent cloths were the same size. 16 Then he joined five of the tent cloths together, and he joined the other six tent cloths together. 17 Next he made 50 loops along the edge of the outermost tent cloth where it joined, and he made 50 loops along the edge of the other tent cloth that joined with it. 18 And he made 50 copper clasps for joining the tent together to become one unit.\n19 He made a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red and a covering out of sealskins to go over that.\n20 Then he made out of acacia wood the tabernacle's panel frames, which stood upright. 21 Each panel frame was ten cubits high and one and a half cubits wide. 22 Each panel frame had two tenons joined to each other. That is how he made all the panel frames of the tabernacle. 23 Thus he made the panel frames for the south side of the tabernacle, 20 panel frames, facing south. 24 Then he made 40 socket pedestals of silver to go under the 20 panel frames, two socket pedestals beneath one panel frame for its two tenons and two socket pedestals under each following panel frame for its two tenons. 25 For the other side of the tabernacle, the northern side, he made 20 panel frames 26 and their 40 socket pedestals of silver, two socket pedestals beneath the one panel frame and two socket pedestals beneath each of the other panel frames.\n27 For the rear section of the tabernacle to the west, he made six panel frames. 28 He made two panel frames as corner posts of the tabernacle at the two rear corners. 29 The posts were doubled from the bottom to the top, up to the first ring. That is what he did with the two corner posts. 30 So they amounted to eight panel frames along with their 16 socket pedestals of silver, two socket pedestals under each panel frame.\n31 Then he made bars of acacia wood, five bars for the panel frames of the one side of the tabernacle 32 and five bars for the panel frames of the other side of the tabernacle and five for the panel frames of the tabernacle for the rear section to the west. 33 He made the middle bar to extend along the middle of the panel frames from one end to the other. 34 He overlaid the panel frames with gold, and he made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.\n35 Then he made a curtain of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. He made it with cherubs embroidered on it. 36 Then he made for it four acacia pillars and overlaid them with gold, along with hooks of gold, and cast four socket pedestals of silver for them. 37 Next he made a screen for the entrance of the tent out of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen woven together, 38 as well as its five pillars and their hooks. He overlaid their tops and their connectors with gold, but their five socket pedestals were of copper.\nChapter 37\n1 Bezalel then made the Ark of acacia wood. It was two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high. 2 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and made a border of gold around it. 3 After that he cast four rings of gold for it, for above its four feet, with two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side. 4 He next made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 5 Then he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the Ark for carrying the Ark.\n6 He made the cover of pure gold. It was two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. 7 He then made two cherubs of hammered gold on both ends of the cover. 8 One cherub was on one end, and the other cherub on the other end. He made the cherubs on both ends of the cover. 9 The two cherubs spread out their wings upward, overshadowing the cover with their wings. They were facing each other, and their faces were turned toward the cover.\n10 He then made the table of acacia wood. It was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold and made a border of gold around it. 12 Next he made a rim the width of a handbreadth to go around it and a border of gold to go around the rim. 13 Further, he cast four rings of gold for it and placed the rings on the four corners where the four legs were attached. 14 The rings were near the rim, as holders for the poles used for carrying the table. 15 Then he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold for carrying the table. 16 After that he made out of pure gold the utensils that went on the table-its dishes, its cups, and its bowls and pitchers from which drink offerings would be poured.\n17 Then he made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work. Its base, its stem, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms were one piece. 18 Six branches were extending out from its stem, three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches from its other side. 19 Three cups shaped like almond flowers were on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like almond flowers were on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. This was done for the six branches extending out from the stem of the lampstand. 20 And on the stem of the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers, with knobs and blossoms alternating. 21 There was a knob under the first two branches that extended out of the stem and a knob under the next two branches and a knob under the next two branches, for the six branches extending out from the stem of the lampstand. 22 The knobs and the branches and the whole lampstand were made to be one piece of pure, hammered gold. 23 Then he made its seven lamps and its snuffers and its fire holders out of pure gold. 24 He made it, along with all its utensils, from a talent of pure gold.\n25 He now made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns were one piece with it. 26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top surface and its sides all around and its horns, and he made a border of gold around it. 27 He made two rings of gold for it below its border on two opposite sides to hold the poles used for carrying it. 28 After that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 29 He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, perfumed incense, skillfully blended.\nChapter 38\n1 He made the altar of burnt offering out of acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 2 Then he made its horns on its four corners. Its horns were one piece with it. Next he overlaid it with copper. 3 After that he made all the utensils of the altar, the buckets, the shovels, the bowls, the forks, and the fire holders. All its utensils he made of copper. 4 He also made a grating for the altar, a network of copper, under its rim, down toward its center. 5 He cast four rings on the four corners near the grating of copper, as holders for the poles. 6 After that he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with copper. 7 He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. He made the altar in the form of a hollow chest of planks.\n8 Then he made the basin of copper and its copper stand; he used the mirrors of the women who were organized to serve at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\n9 Then he made the courtyard. For the south side of the courtyard, facing south, he made the hanging curtains of fine twisted linen, for 100 cubits. 10 There were 20 pillars and 20 socket pedestals of copper, and the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver. 11 Also, for the north side, there were 100 cubits of hanging curtains. Their 20 pillars and their 20 socket pedestals were of copper. The hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver. 12 But for the west side, the hanging curtains were for 50 cubits. There were ten pillars and ten socket pedestals, and the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver. 13 The width of the east side, toward the sunrising, was 50 cubits. 14 There were 15 cubits of hanging curtains on the one wing, with three pillars and three socket pedestals. 15 And for the other wing on the other side of the entrance of the courtyard, there were hanging curtains for 15 cubits, with three pillars and three socket pedestals. 16 All the hanging curtains around the courtyard were of fine twisted linen. 17 The socket pedestals for the pillars were of copper, the hooks of the pillars and their connectors were of silver, the tops were overlaid with silver, and there were silver fasteners for all the pillars of the courtyard.\n18 The screen of the entrance of the courtyard was woven of blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. It was 20 cubits long and 5 cubits high, the same height as the hanging curtains of the courtyard. 19 Their four pillars and their four socket pedestals were made of copper. Their hooks and connectors were of silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver. 20 All the tent pins for the tabernacle and around the courtyard were of copper.\n21 The following is the inventory of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, which was inventoried at the command of Moses, as the responsibility of the Levites under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 22 Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah did all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. 23 With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman and an embroiderer and a weaver of the blue thread, the purple wool, the scarlet material, and the fine linen.\n24 All the gold that was used for all the work of the holy place equaled the amount of the gold of the wave offering, 29 talents and 730 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place. 25 And the silver of the ones registered of the assembly was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place. 26 The half shekel for each individual was half a shekel by the standard shekel of the holy place for every man who was among those registered from 20 years of age and up, amounting to 603,550.\n27 The casting of the socket pedestals of the holy place and the socket pedestals of the curtain amounted to 100 talents; 100 socket pedestals equaled 100 talents, one talent for each socket pedestal. 28 From the 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and joined them together.\n29 The copper of the offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels. 30 With this he made the socket pedestals of the entrance of the tent of meeting, the copper altar and its copper grating, all the utensils of the altar, 31 the socket pedestals around the courtyard, the socket pedestals of the entrance of the courtyard, and all the tent pins of the tabernacle and all the tent pins around the courtyard.\nChapter 39\n1 From the blue thread, the purple wool, and the scarlet material, they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place. They made the holy garments that were for Aaron, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n2 He made the ephod of gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. 3 They hammered plates of gold into thin sheets, and he cut it into threads to work in with the blue thread, the purple wool, the scarlet material, and the fine linen, and it was embroidered. 4 They made shoulder pieces for it that were joined at its two top edges. 5 And the woven belt, which was attached to the ephod for tying it securely in position, was made of the same material, of gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n6 Then they mounted the onyx stones in gold settings, and they engraved them with the names of the sons of Israel, as they would engrave a seal. 7 He placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 8 Then he made the breastpiece with the workmanship of an embroiderer, like the workmanship of the ephod, out of gold, blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine twisted linen. 9 It was square when doubled. They made the breastpiece, which, when doubled, was as long and as wide as the span of the hand. 10 They set four rows of stones in it. The first row was ruby, topaz, and emerald. 11 The second row was turquoise, sapphire, and jasper. 12 The third row was leshem stone, agate, and amethyst. 13 And the fourth row was chrysolite, onyx, and jade. They were mounted in settings of gold. 14 The stones corresponded to the names of the 12 sons of Israel, and the names were engraved like a seal, each name representing one of the 12 tribes.\n15 Then they made wreathed chains on the breastpiece, like cords of pure gold. 16 And they made two settings of gold and two rings of gold and attached the two rings to the two corners of the breastpiece. 17 After that they put the two cords of gold through the two rings at the corners of the breastpiece. 18 Then they put the two ends of the two cords through the two settings and attached them to the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod. 19 Next they made two rings of gold and set them at the two ends on the inside edge of the breastpiece, facing the ephod. 20 Then they made two more rings of gold and put them on the front of the ephod, below the two shoulder pieces, close to where it is joined, above the woven belt of the ephod. 21 Finally, they tied the breastpiece with a blue cord from its rings to the rings of the ephod, in order to keep the breastpiece in its place on the ephod, above the woven belt, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n22 Then he made the sleeveless coat of the ephod, woven by a loom worker, all of blue thread. 23 The opening of the sleeveless coat was in the middle of it, like the opening of a coat of mail. Its opening had a border around it, so that it would not be torn. 24 Next they made on the hem of the sleeveless coat pomegranates of blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material, twisted together. 25 And they made bells of pure gold and put the bells in between the pomegranates all around the hem of the sleeveless coat, in between the pomegranates; 26 they alternated a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the sleeveless coat, which was used for ministering, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n27 And they made the robes of fine linen, woven by a loom worker, for Aaron and his sons, 28 and the turban of fine linen, the ornamental headgear of fine linen, the linen shorts of fine twisted linen, 29 and the sash of fine twisted linen, blue thread, purple wool, and scarlet material woven together, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n30 Finally, they made the shining plate, the holy sign of dedication, out of pure gold and inscribed on it an inscription as one would engrave a seal: \"Holiness belongs to Jehovah.\" 31 They attached to it a cord made from blue thread in order to put it on the turban, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n32 So all the work for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed, and the Israelites did everything that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.\n33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its equipment: its clasps, its panel frames, its bars and its pillars and its socket pedestals; 34 its covering of ram skins dyed red, its covering of sealskins, the curtain for the screen; 35 the ark of the Testimony and its poles and the cover; 36 the table, all its utensils and the showbread; 37 the lampstand of pure gold, its lamps, the row of lamps, and all its utensils and the oil for lighting; 38 the altar of gold, the anointing oil, the perfumed incense, the screen for the entrance of the tent; 39 the altar of copper and its grating of copper, its poles, all its utensils, the basin and its stand; 40 the hanging curtains of the courtyard, its pillars and its socket pedestals, the screen for the entrance of the courtyard, its tent cords and its tent pins and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; 41 the finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons for serving as priests.\n42 According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, that was how the Israelites did all the work. 43 When Moses inspected all their work, he saw that they had done it just as Jehovah had commanded; and Moses blessed them.\nChapter 40\n1 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 2 \"On the first day of the first month, you are to set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting. 3 Place the ark of the Testimony in it, and screen off the Ark with the curtain. 4 You are to bring the table in and arrange the things that belong on it and bring in the lampstand and light its lamps. 5 Then put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the Testimony and put the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle in place.\n6 \"You are to put the altar of burnt offering before the entrance of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, 7 and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it. 8 Then set up the courtyard around it and put up the screen for the entrance of the courtyard. 9 Next you are to take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and sanctify it and all its utensils, so that it will become something holy. 10 You are to anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils and sanctify the altar, so that it will become a most holy altar. 11 And anoint the basin and its stand and sanctify it.\n12 \"Then bring Aaron and his sons near to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water. 13 And you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him, and he will serve as priest to me. 14 After that bring his sons near, and clothe them with robes. 15 You are to anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they will serve as priests to me, and their anointing will serve continually for them as a lasting priesthood during their generations.\"\n16 Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.\n17 In the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up. 18 When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put its socket pedestals down, set up the panel frames, put its bars in, and set up its pillars. 19 He spread out the tent over the tabernacle and placed the covering of the tent over it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n20 After that he took the Testimony and put it into the Ark and placed the poles on the Ark and put the cover on the Ark. 21 He brought the Ark into the tabernacle and put the curtain of the screen in place and screened off the ark of the Testimony, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n22 Next he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain, 23 and he arranged the row of bread on it before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n24 He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting in front of the table, on the south side of the tabernacle. 25 He lit the lamps before Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n26 He next placed the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the curtain, 27 in order to make perfumed incense smoke on it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n28 Then he put the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle in place.\n29 He placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, so that he might offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on it, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n30 He then placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing. 31 Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet at it. 32 Whenever they went into the tent of meeting or approached the altar, they would wash, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n33 Finally he set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar and put up the screen for the entrance of the courtyard.\nSo Moses finished the work. 34 And the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting, and Jehovah's glory filled the tabernacle. 35 Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting because the cloud remained over it, and Jehovah's glory filled the tabernacle.\n36 And when the cloud lifted from the tabernacle, the Israelites would break camp during all stages of their journey. 37 However, if the cloud did not lift up, then they would not break camp until the day it lifted. 38 For Jehovah's cloud was over the tabernacle by day, and a fire remained over it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel during all stages of their journey. \n",

He should present it of his own free will before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 4 He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted in his behalf to make atonement for him.\n5 \"'Then the young bull must be slaughtered before Jehovah, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, will present the blood and sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 6 The burnt offering should be skinned and cut into pieces. 7 The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 8 The sons of Aaron, the priests, will arrange the pieces of the offering with the head and the suet over the wood that is on the fire on the altar. 9 Its intestines and its shanks will be washed with water, and the priest is to make all of it smoke on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\n10 \"'If his offering for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the young rams or the goats, he should present a sound male. 11 It is to be slaughtered at the north side of the altar before Jehovah, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar. 12 He will cut it up into pieces, and with its head and its suet, the priest will arrange them over the wood on the fire on the altar. 13 He will wash the intestines and the shanks with water, and the priest will present all of it and make it smoke on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\n14 \"'However, if he offers birds as a burnt offering to Jehovah, he will present his offering from the turtledoves or the young pigeons. 15 The priest will present it at the altar and nip off its head and make it smoke on the altar, but its blood should be drained out on the side of the altar. 16 He should remove its crop and its feathers and throw them beside the altar, to the east, to the place for the ashes. 17 He will split it at its wings without dividing it into two parts. Then the priest will make it smoke on the altar over the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\nChapter 2\n1 \"'Now if someone presents a grain offering to Jehovah, his offering must be fine flour, and he should pour oil on it and put frankincense on it. 2 Then he will bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests, and the priest will take a handful of the fine flour and oil and all its frankincense, and he will make it smoke as a token offering on the altar, an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 3 Whatever is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons as something most holy from Jehovah's offerings made by fire.\n4 \"'If you present a grain offering that has been baked in the oven, it should be of fine flour, unleavened ring-shaped loaves mixed with oil or unleavened wafers spread with oil.\n5 \"'If your offering is a grain offering from the griddle, it should be of fine, unleavened flour mixed with oil. 6 It should be broken into pieces, and you are to pour oil on it. It is a grain offering.\n7 \"'If your offering is a grain offering prepared in a pan, it should be made of fine flour with oil. 8 You should bring the grain offering that was made of these to Jehovah, and it will be presented to the priest, who will bring it near to the altar. 9 And the priest will lift off some of the grain offering as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar as an offering made by fire of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 10 What is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons as something most holy of Jehovah's offerings by fire.\n11 \"'No grain offering that you present to Jehovah should be leavened, for you must not make any sourdough or honey smoke as an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\n12 \"'You may present them to Jehovah as an offering of the firstfruits, but they must not be brought to the altar as a pleasing aroma.\n13 \"'Every grain offering you make is to be seasoned with salt; and you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing from your grain offering. Along with every offering of yours, you will present salt.\n14 \"'If you present the grain offering of the first ripe fruits to Jehovah, you should present new grain roasted with fire, coarsely crushed new kernels, as the grain offering of your first ripe fruits. 15 You are to put oil on it and place frankincense on it. It is a grain offering. 16 The priest will make it smoke as a token offering, that is, some of the coarse grain and oil along with all its frankincense, as an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\nChapter 3\n1 \"'If his offering is a communion sacrifice and if he is presenting it from the herd, whether a male or a female, he should present a sound animal before Jehovah. 2 He is to lay his hand on the head of his offering, and it will be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons, the priests, will sprinkle the blood on all sides of the altar. 3 He will present part of the communion sacrifice as an offering made by fire to Jehovah: the fat that covers the intestines, all the fat that surrounds the intestines, 4 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins. He will also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 5 Aaron's sons will make it smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering that is placed on the wood that is over the fire; it is an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\n6 \"'If his offering is from the flock for a communion sacrifice to Jehovah, he will present a sound male or a female animal. 7 If he is presenting a young ram as his offering, then he will present it before Jehovah. 8 He will lay his hand on the head of his offering, and it will be slaughtered in front of the tent of meeting. Aaron's sons will sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar. 9 He will present the fat from the communion sacrifice as an offering made by fire to Jehovah. He will remove the entire fat tail near the backbone, the fat that covers the intestines, all the fat that surrounds the intestines, 10 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins. He will also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 11 And the priest will make it smoke on the altar as food, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\n12 \"'If his offering is a goat, then he will present it before Jehovah. 13 He will lay his hand on its head, and it will be slaughtered before the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons must sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar. 14 The part he will present as his offering made by fire to Jehovah is the fat that covers the intestines, all the fat that surrounds the intestines, 15 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins. He will also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 16 The priest will make them smoke on the altar as food, an offering made by fire for a pleasing aroma. All the fat belongs to Jehovah.\n17 \"'It is a lasting statute for your generations, in all your dwelling places: You must not eat any fat or any blood at all.'\"\nChapter 4\n1 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: 2 \"Tell the Israelites, 'If someone sins unintentionally by doing any of the things that Jehovah commanded should not be done:\n3 \"'If the anointed priest sins and brings guilt on the people, then he must present a sound young bull to Jehovah as a sin offering for the sin he committed. 4 He will bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah and lay his hand on the bull's head, and he is to slaughter the bull before Jehovah. 5 Then the anointed priest will take some of the bull's blood and bring it into the tent of meeting; 6 and the priest will dip his finger in the blood and spatter some of the blood seven times before Jehovah in front of the curtain of the holy place. 7 The priest will also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of perfumed incense, which is before Jehovah in the tent of meeting; and he will pour all the rest of the bull's blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\n8 \"'He will then remove all the fat of the bull of the sin offering, including the fat that covers the intestines and the fat that surrounds the intestines, 9 and the two kidneys with the fat on them that is near the loins. And he will remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 10 It will be the same as what is removed from a bull of the communion sacrifice. And the priest will make them smoke on the altar of burnt offering.\n11 \"'But as for the skin of the bull and all its flesh along with its head, its shanks, its intestines, and its dung- 12 all the rest of the bull-he will have it taken to the outskirts of the camp to a clean place where the ashes are discarded, and he will burn it on wood in the fire. It should be burned where the ashes are discarded.\n13 \"'Now if the entire assembly of Israel has become guilty by committing a sin unintentionally, but the congregation was unaware that they had done something that Jehovah commanded them not to do, 14 and then the sin becomes known, the congregation must present a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting. 15 The elders of the assembly will lay their hands on the bull's head before Jehovah, and the bull will be slaughtered before Jehovah.\n16 \"'Then the anointed priest will bring some of the bull's blood into the tent of meeting. 17 The priest is to dip his finger into the blood and spatter some of it seven times before Jehovah in front of the curtain. 18 He will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and he will pour all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 19 He will remove all its fat and make it smoke on the altar. 20 He is to do to the bull just as he did to the other bull of the sin offering. That is how he will do it, and the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven. 21 He will have the bull taken to the outskirts of the camp and will burn it, just as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering for the congregation.\n22 \"'When a chieftain unintentionally sins by doing one of all the things that Jehovah his God commands should not be done and has become guilty, 23 or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has committed against the commandment, then he must bring a sound young male goat as his offering. 24 He will lay his hand on the head of the young goat and slaughter it in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before Jehovah. It is a sin offering. 25 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he will pour the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. 26 He will make all its fat smoke on the altar like the fat of the communion sacrifice; and the priest will make atonement for him for his sin, and it will be forgiven him.\n27 \"'If any one of the people of the land sins unintentionally and becomes guilty by doing one of the things that Jehovah commands should not be done, 28 or if he becomes aware of a sin that he has committed, then he should bring a sound young female goat as his offering for the sin he has committed. 29 He will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the same place as the burnt offering. 30 The priest will take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he will pour all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 31 He will remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from the communion sacrifice, and the priest will make it smoke on the altar as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah; and the priest will make atonement for him, and it will be forgiven him.\n32 \"'But if he offers a lamb as his sin offering, he should bring a sound female lamb. 33 He will lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. 34 The priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he will pour all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 35 He will remove all its fat the same way that the fat of the young ram of the communion sacrifice is removed, and the priest will make them smoke on the altar on top of Jehovah's offerings made by fire; and the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and it will be forgiven him.\nChapter 5\n1 \"'If someone sins because he has heard a public call to testify and he is a witness or has seen or learned about it and he does not report it, then he will answer for his error.\n2 \"'Or when a person touches anything unclean, whether the dead body of an unclean wild animal, an unclean domestic animal, or an unclean swarming creature, he is unclean and has become guilty even if he does not realize it. 3 Or in case someone without being aware of it touches human uncleanness-anything unclean that may make him unclean-and he comes to know it, then he becomes guilty.\n4 \"'Or if someone rashly swears to do something-whether it is to do good or to do evil, no matter what it may be-and he was unaware of it, but then he realizes that he has sworn rashly, he becomes guilty.\n5 \"'If he becomes guilty as respects one of these things, then he must confess in what way he has sinned. 6 He will also bring his guilt offering to Jehovah for the sin that he committed, namely, a female from the flock, either a female lamb or a young female goat, for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement for him for his sin.\n7 \"'If, though, he cannot afford a sheep, he must bring to Jehovah two turtledoves or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for the sin, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering. 8 He is to bring them to the priest, who will present first the one for the sin offering and nip off its head at the front of its neck, without severing it. 9 He will spatter some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, but the remainder of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering. 10 He will handle the other one as a burnt offering according to the regular procedure; and the priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and it will be forgiven him.\n11 \"'Now if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he must bring as his offering for his sin a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering. He should not add oil to it or place frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering. 12 He will bring it to the priest, and the priest will take from it his handful as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar on top of Jehovah's offerings made by fire. It is a sin offering. 13 The priest will make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, any one of these sins, and it will be forgiven him. The remainder of the offering will become the priest's, just like the grain offering.'\"\n14 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 15 \"If someone behaves unfaithfully by unintentionally sinning against the holy things of Jehovah, he is to bring to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock as a guilt offering; its value in silver shekels is set according to the standard shekel of the holy place. 16 And he will make compensation for the sin he has committed against the holy place and he will also add a fifth of its value. He will give it to the priest, so that the priest may make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him.\n17 \"If someone sins by doing any of the things that Jehovah commands should not be done, even if he is not aware of it, he is still guilty and will answer for his error. 18 He should bring to the priest a sound ram from the flock according to the estimated value, for a guilt offering. Then the priest will make atonement for him for the unintentional mistake that he unknowingly committed, and it will be forgiven him. 19 It is a guilt offering. He has certainly become guilty of sinning against Jehovah.\"\nChapter 6\n1 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: 2 \"If someone sins and behaves unfaithfully toward Jehovah by deceiving his neighbor in connection with something entrusted to him, or something deposited with him, or he robs or defrauds his neighbor, 3 or he finds something lost and is deceptive about it, and if he swears falsely over any such sin he may commit, this is what he should do: 4 If he has sinned and is guilty, he must return what he stole, what he extorted, what he took by fraud, what was entrusted to him, or the lost thing that he found, 5 or anything about which he swore falsely, and he must make full compensation for it, and he will add to it a fifth of its value. He will give it to the owner on the day his guilt is proved. 6 And he will bring to the priest as his guilt offering to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock according to the assessed value, for a guilt offering. 7 The priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done resulting in his guilt.\"\n8 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 9 \"Command Aaron and his sons and say, 'This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering will remain on the hearth on the altar all night long until the morning, and the fire will be kept burning on the altar. 10 The priest will clothe himself with his official dress of linen, and he will put the linen shorts on over his flesh. Then he will remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire had consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar. 11 Then he will take off his garments and put on other garments and take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp. 12 The fire will be kept burning on the altar. It must not go out. The priest must burn wood on it each morning and arrange the burnt offering over it, and he will make the fat of the communion sacrifices smoke over it. 13 Fire will be kept constantly burning on the altar. It must not go out.\n14 \"'Now this is the law of the grain offering: You sons of Aaron are to present it before Jehovah in front of the altar. 15 One of them will take a handful from the fine flour of the grain offering and some of its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering, and he will make it smoke on the altar as a pleasing aroma for a token offering to Jehovah. 16 Aaron and his sons will eat what is left of it. It will be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place. They will eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting. 17 It should not be baked with anything leavened. I have given it as their share out of my offerings made by fire. It is something most holy, like the sin offering and like the guilt offering. 18 Every male among the sons of Aaron will eat it. It is their permanent allowance throughout your generations from Jehovah's offerings made by fire. Everything that touches them will become holy.'\"\n19 Jehovah spoke again to Moses: 20 \"This is the offering that Aaron and his sons will present to Jehovah on the day he is anointed: the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. 21 It will be made with oil on a griddle. You will bring it well-mixed with oil and present it in pieces as a baked product of the grain offering as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 22 The anointed priest who succeeds him from among his sons will make it. It is a lasting regulation: As a whole offering it will be made to smoke to Jehovah. 23 Every grain offering of a priest should be a whole offering. It must not be eaten.\"\n24 Jehovah spoke again to Moses and said: 25 \"Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering will also be slaughtered before Jehovah. It is a most holy thing. 26 The priest who offers it for sin will eat it. It will be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.\n27 \"'Everything that touches its flesh will become holy, and when anyone spatters some of its blood on his garment, you should wash what was spattered with blood in a holy place. 28 The earthenware vessel in which it was boiled is to be shattered. But if it was boiled in a copper vessel, then the vessel must be scoured and washed with water.\n29 \"'Every male among the priests will eat it. It is something most holy. 30 However, no sin offering is to be eaten if some of its blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place. It is to be burned with fire.\nChapter 7\n1 \"'This is the law of the guilt offering: It is something most holy. 2 They will slaughter the guilt offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offerings, and its blood should be sprinkled on all sides of the altar. 3 He will present all its fat, including the fat tail, the fat that covers the intestines, 4 and the two kidneys with their fat that is near the loins. He will also remove the appendage of the liver along with the kidneys. 5 The priest will make them smoke on the altar as an offering made by fire to Jehovah. It is a guilt offering. 6 Every male among the priests will eat it, and it should be eaten in a holy place. It is something most holy. 7 The law regarding the sin offering applies to the guilt offering; it belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.\n8 \"'When the priest presents the burnt offering for someone, the skin of the burnt offering that was presented to the priest will become his.\n9 \"'Every grain offering that is baked in the oven or prepared in the pan or on the griddle belongs to the priest who presents it. It will become his. 10 But every grain offering that is mixed with oil or that is dry will be for all of Aaron's sons; each will have an equal share.\n11 \"'Now this is the law of the communion sacrifice that one may present to Jehovah: 12 If he presents it as an expression of thanksgiving, he will present along with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened ring-shaped loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and ring-shaped loaves made with fine flour, well-mixed and blended with oil. 13 He will present his offering along with ring-shaped loaves of leavened bread and the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices. 14 He is to present from it one of each offering as a sacred portion to Jehovah; it will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the communion sacrifices. 15 The flesh of the thanksgiving sacrifice of his communion sacrifices is to be eaten on the day he offers it. He must not save any of it until morning.\n16 \"'If the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it is to be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, and what is left of it may also be eaten on the next day. 17 But whatever is left of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day is to be burned with fire. 18 However, if any of the flesh of his communion sacrifice is eaten on the third day, the one presenting it will not be accepted with approval. It will not be credited to him; it is an offensive thing, and the person who eats some of it will answer for his error. 19 Flesh that touches anything unclean is not to be eaten. It is to be burned with fire. Everyone who is clean may eat the clean flesh.\n20 \"'But any person who is unclean and eats the flesh of the communion sacrifice, which is for Jehovah, that person must be cut off from his people. 21 If someone touches anything unclean, whether the uncleanness of a man or an unclean animal or any unclean disgusting thing, and eats some of the flesh of the communion sacrifice, which is for Jehovah, that person must be cut off from his people.'\"\n22 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 23 \"Tell the Israelites, 'You must not eat any fat of a bull or a young ram or a goat. 24 The fat of an animal found dead and the fat of an animal killed by another animal may be used for any other purpose, but you must never eat it. 25 For whoever eats fat from an animal that he presents as an offering made by fire to Jehovah must be cut off from his people.\n26 \"'You must not eat any blood in any of your dwelling places, whether that of birds or that of animals. 27 Anyone who eats any blood must be cut off from his people.'\"\n28 Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying: 29 \"Tell the Israelites, 'Whoever presents his communion sacrifice to Jehovah will bring part of the offering from his communion sacrifice to Jehovah. 30 He will bring in his own hands the fat along with the breast as an offering made by fire to Jehovah, and he will wave it back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 31 The priest will make the fat smoke on the altar, but the breast will belong to Aaron and his sons.\n32 \"'You will give the right leg as a sacred portion to the priest from your communion sacrifices. 33 The son of Aaron who presents the blood of the communion sacrifices and the fat will have the right leg as his portion. 34 For I take the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion from the communion sacrifices of the Israelites, and I give them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a lasting regulation for the Israelites.\n35 \"'This was the portion from Jehovah's offerings made by fire to be set aside for the priests, for Aaron and his sons, on the day he presented them to serve as priests to Jehovah. 36 Jehovah commanded to give them this portion from the Israelites on the day he anointed them. It is a permanent statute for their generations.'\"\n37 This is the law concerning the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the installation sacrifice, and the communion sacrifice, 38 just as Jehovah commanded Moses on Mount Sinai in the day he commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai.\nChapter 8\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 \"Take Aaron and his sons with him, the garments, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread, 3 and make all the assembly gather together at the entrance of the tent of meeting.\"\n4 Then Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him, and the assembly gathered together at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 5 Moses now said to the assembly: \"This is what Jehovah has commanded us to do.\" 6 So Moses brought Aaron and his sons near and washed them with water. 7 After that he put the robe on him, wrapped him with the sash, clothed him with the sleeveless coat, and put the ephod on him and tied it with the woven belt of the ephod, binding it securely on him. 8 Next he placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastpiece. 9 Then he placed the turban on his head, and he put on the front of the turban the shining plate of gold, the holy sign of dedication, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n10 Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and sanctified them. 11 After that he spattered some of it seven times on the altar and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its stand in order to sanctify them. 12 Finally he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him in order to sanctify him.\n13 Moses then brought Aaron's sons near and clothed them with robes and wrapped them with sashes and put headgear on them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n14 Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering. 15 Moses slaughtered it and took the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides, and he purified the altar from sin, but the rest of the blood he poured at the base of the altar, in order to sanctify it to make atonement on it. 16 After that he took all the fat that was on the intestines, the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses made them smoke on the altar. 17 Then he had the rest of the bull, its skin, its flesh, and its dung, burned with fire outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n18 He now brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 19 Moses then slaughtered it and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar. 20 He cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses made the head, the pieces, and the suet smoke. 21 He washed the intestines and the shanks with water, and Moses made the entire ram smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n22 Then he brought the second ram, the ram of the installation, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram's head. 23 Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on Aaron's right earlobe and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 24 Next Moses brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on their right earlobe and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot; but Moses sprinkled the rest of the blood on all sides of the altar.\n25 Then he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the intestines, the appendage of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right leg. 26 He took out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah one unleavened ring-shaped loaf, one ring-shaped loaf of oiled bread, and one wafer. He then placed them on the pieces of fat and the right leg. 27 After that he put all of them on the palms of Aaron and the palms of his sons and began to wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 28 Then Moses took them from their hands and made them smoke on the altar on top of the burnt offering. They were an installation sacrifice as a pleasing aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\n29 Moses then took the breast and waved it back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. From the installation ram it became the portion for Moses, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n30 And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and spattered it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and the garments of his sons who were with him. Thus he sanctified Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.\n31 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons: \"Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and you will eat it there with the bread that is in the installation basket, just as I was commanded, 'Aaron and his sons will eat it.' 32 What is left over of the flesh and the bread you will burn with fire. 33 You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days for completing your installation are over, because it will take seven days to install you as priests. 34 Jehovah commanded that we do what we have done today in order to make atonement for you. 35 You will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and carry out your obligation to Jehovah, so that you may not die; for so I have been commanded.\"\n36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses.\nChapter 9\n1 On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. 2 He said to Aaron: \"Take for yourself a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, sound ones, and present them before Jehovah. 3 But you will say to the Israelites, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a young ram, each a year old, sound ones, for a burnt offering, 4 and a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices, to sacrifice them before Jehovah, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today Jehovah will appear to you.'\"\n5 So they took what Moses had commanded before the tent of meeting. Then the whole assembly came forward and stood before Jehovah. 6 And Moses said: \"This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, so that the glory of Jehovah may appear to you.\" 7 Then Moses said to Aaron: \"Approach the altar and present your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement in your own behalf and in behalf of your house; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement in their behalf, just as Jehovah has commanded.\"\n8 Aaron immediately approached the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering that was for him. 9 Then Aaron's sons presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and he poured the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 10 He made the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver from the sin offering smoke on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 11 And he burned the flesh and the skin with fire outside the camp.\n12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar. 13 They handed him the pieces of the burnt offering along with the head, and he made them smoke on the altar. 14 Further, he washed the intestines and the shanks and made them smoke on the burnt offering on the altar.\n15 He then presented the offering of the people and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and slaughtered it and made a sin offering with it like the first one. 16 And he presented the burnt offering and handled it according to the regular procedure.\n17 He next presented the grain offering, filling his hand with some of it and making it smoke on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.\n18 After that he slaughtered the bull and the ram of the communion sacrifice that was for the people. Then Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around on all sides of the altar. 19 As for the pieces of fat of the bull, the fat tail of the ram, the fat covering the internal organs, the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver, 20 they placed all those pieces of fat on the breasts, after which he made the pieces of fat smoke on the altar. 21 But the breasts and the right leg Aaron waved back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.\n22 Then Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices. 23 Finally Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and blessed the people.\nJehovah's glory now appeared to all the people, 24 and fire came out from Jehovah and began consuming the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they started shouting and they fell with their faces to the ground.\nChapter 10\n1 Later Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took his fire holder and put fire in it and placed incense on it. Then they began offering before Jehovah unauthorized fire, which he had not commanded them to do. 2 At this a fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, so that they died before Jehovah. 3 Then Moses said to Aaron: \"This is what Jehovah has said, 'I will be made holy among those near to me, and I will be glorified before all the people.'\" And Aaron kept silent.\n4 So Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them: \"Come here, carry your brothers from in front of the holy place to a place outside the camp.\" 5 So they came forward and carried the men away in their robes to a place outside the camp, just as Moses had told them.\n6 Moses then said to Aaron and his other sons Eleazar and Ithamar: \"Do not let your heads go ungroomed or tear your garments, so that you may not die and that God may not become indignant against all the assembly. Your brothers of the whole house of Israel will weep over those whom Jehovah has killed by the fire. 7 You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting or you will die, for Jehovah's anointing oil is upon you.\" So they did according to Moses' word.\n8 Then Jehovah said to Aaron: 9 \"Do not drink wine or other alcoholic beverages, you and your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die. It is a permanent statute for your generations. 10 This is to distinguish between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean, 11 and to teach the Israelites all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses.\"\n12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: \"Take what was left of the grain offering from Jehovah's offerings made by fire and eat it as unleavened bread near the altar, because it is something most holy. 13 You must eat it in a holy place, because it is your allowance and the allowance of your sons from Jehovah's offerings made by fire, for this is what I have been commanded. 14 You will also eat the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the sacred portion in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because these things have been given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion sacrifices of the Israelites. 15 They will bring the leg of the sacred portion and the breast of the wave offering along with the offerings of fat made by fire, in order to wave the wave offering back and forth before Jehovah; and it will serve as a permanent allowance for you and your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.\"\n16 And Moses diligently searched for the goat of the sin offering, and he discovered that it had been burned up. So he grew indignant at Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons who were left, and he said: 17 \"Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place, since it is something most holy and he has given it to you so that you may answer for the error of the assembly and make atonement for them before Jehovah? 18 Look! Its blood has not been brought inside the holy place. You certainly should have eaten it in the holy place, just as I was commanded.\" 19 Aaron replied to Moses: \"Look! Today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and yet these things happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would that have been pleasing to Jehovah?\" 20 When Moses heard that, he was satisfied.\nChapter 11\n1 Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: 2 \"Tell the Israelites, 'These are the living creatures of the earth that you may eat: 3 Every animal that has a split hoof and a cleft in its hooves and that chews the cud may be eaten.\n4 \"'But you must not eat these animals that chew the cud or have a split hoof: the camel, which chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. It is unclean for you. 5 Also the rock badger, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. It is unclean for you. 6 Also the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. It is unclean for you. 7 Also the pig, because it has a split hoof and a cleft in the hoof but does not chew the cud. It is unclean for you. 8 You must not eat any of their flesh or touch their dead body. They are unclean for you.\n9 \"'This is what you may eat of everything in the waters: Anything in the waters that has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers, it you may eat. 10 But anything in the seas and in the rivers that has no fins and scales, among all the swarming creatures and of every other living creature that is in the waters, it is a loathsome thing for you. 11 Yes, they should be loathsome to you, and you must not eat any of their flesh and you must loathe their carcasses. 12 Everything in the waters that has no fins and scales is a loathsome thing to you.\n13 \"'These are the flying creatures that you are to loathe; they should not be eaten, for they are loathsome: the eagle, the osprey, the black vulture, 14 the red kite and every kind of black kite, 15 every kind of raven, 16 the ostrich, the owl, the gull, every kind of falcon, 17 the little owl, the cormorant, the long-eared owl, 18 the swan, the pelican, the vulture, 19 the stork, every kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat. 20 Every winged swarming creature that goes on all fours is something loathsome to you.\n21 \"'Of the winged swarming creatures that move on all fours, you may eat only those that have jointed legs above their feet for leaping on the ground. 22 Of these you may eat: various kinds of migratory locusts, other edible locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers. 23 All other winged swarming creatures with four legs are something loathsome to you. 24 By these you would make yourselves unclean. Everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the evening. 25 Anyone carrying any of their dead bodies should wash his garments; he will be unclean until the evening.\n26 \"'Any animal that has a split hoof but does not have a cleft and does not chew its cud is unclean to you. Everyone touching them will be unclean. 27 Every living creature that walks on paws among the creatures that walk on all fours is unclean to you. Everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the evening. 28 The one who carries their dead bodies should wash his garments, and he will be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you.\n29 \"'These are the swarming creatures of the earth that are unclean to you: the mole rat, the mouse, every kind of lizard, 30 the gecko, the large lizard, the newt, the sand lizard, and the chameleon. 31 These swarming creatures are unclean to you. Everyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean until the evening.\n32 \"'Now anything they fall on when they die will be unclean, whether a wooden utensil, a garment, a skin, or a piece of sackcloth. Any utensil that is used should be immersed in water, and it will be unclean until the evening; then it will be clean. 33 If they fall into an earthenware vessel, you are to smash it, and anything that was in it will be unclean. 34 Any kind of food that comes in contact with water from such a vessel will be unclean, and any drinkable liquid in such a vessel will be unclean. 35 Anything their dead bodies fall on will be unclean. Whether oven or small stove, it should be broken into pieces. They are unclean, and they will remain unclean to you. 36 Only a spring and a cistern for storing water will continue clean, but anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean. 37 If their dead bodies fall on a plant seed that is to be sown, it is clean. 38 But if water is put on a seed and part of their dead body falls on it, the seed is unclean to you.\n39 \"'Now if an animal that you use for food dies, whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until the evening. 40 Whoever eats any of its dead body should wash his garments, and he will be unclean until the evening. Whoever carries off its dead body should wash his garments, and he will be unclean until the evening. 41 Every swarming creature of the earth is something loathsome. It must not be eaten. 42 You must not eat any creature that crawls on its belly, any creature that goes on all fours, or any of earth's swarming creatures with a great number of legs, for they are something loathsome. 43 Do not make yourselves loathsome by means of any swarming creature, and do not defile yourselves and become unclean by them. 44 For I am Jehovah your God, and you must sanctify yourselves and become holy, because I am holy. So you must not make yourselves unclean by any swarming creature that moves on the earth. 45 For I am Jehovah, who is leading you up out of the land of Egypt to prove myself God to you, and you must be holy, because I am holy.\n46 \"'This is the law about the animals, the flying creatures, every living creature that moves through the waters, and concerning every creature that swarms on the earth, 47 in order to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.'\"\nChapter 12\n1 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: 2 \"Tell the Israelites, 'If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a male, she will be unclean for seven days, just as she is in the days of the impurity when she is menstruating. 3 On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin will be circumcised. 4 She will continue cleansing herself from the blood for the next 33 days. She should not touch any holy thing, and she should not come into the holy place until she fulfills the days of her purification.\n5 \"'If she should give birth to a female, she will then be unclean for 14 days, just as she would be during her menstruation. She will continue cleansing herself from the blood for the next 66 days. 6 When the days of her purification for a son or a daughter are completed, she will bring a young ram in its first year for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest. 7 He will present it before Jehovah and make atonement for her, and she will be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law about the woman who gives birth to either a male or a female. 8 But if she cannot afford a sheep, she must then take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'\"\nChapter 13\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 \"If a man develops on his skin a swelling, a scab, or a blotch and it could become the disease of leprosy on his skin, he must then be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests. 3 The priest will examine the infection on his skin. When the hair in the infection has turned white and the appearance of the infection is deeper than the skin, it is the disease of leprosy. The priest will examine it and declare him unclean. 4 But if the blotch on his skin is white and its appearance is not deeper than the skin and the hair has not turned white, the priest will then quarantine the infected person for seven days. 5 The priest will then examine him on the seventh day, and if it appears that the infection has stopped and has not spread on the skin, the priest will quarantine him for another seven days.\n6 \"The priest should examine him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and has not spread in the skin, the priest will declare him clean; it was only a scab. The man will then wash his garments and be clean. 7 But if the scab has definitely spread on the skin after he appears before the priest to establish his purification, he will then appear again before the priest. 8 The priest will examine it, and if the scab has spread in the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is leprosy.\n9 \"If the disease of leprosy develops in a man, he must then be brought to the priest, 10 and the priest will examine him. If there is a white swelling on the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is an open sore in the swelling, 11 it is chronic leprosy on his skin, and the priest will declare him unclean. He should not quarantine him, for he is unclean. 12 Now if the leprosy breaks out all over the skin and the leprosy covers the person with the disease from head to foot, as far as the priest can see, 13 and the priest has examined him and sees that the leprosy has covered all his skin, he will then declare the infected person clean. All of it has turned white, and he is clean. 14 But whenever an open sore appears in it, he will be unclean. 15 When the priest sees the open sore, he will declare him unclean. The open sore is unclean. It is leprosy. 16 But if the open sore again turns white, he will then come to the priest. 17 The priest will examine him, and if the infection has turned white, the priest will then declare the infected person clean. He is clean.\n18 \"If a person develops a boil on his skin and it heals, 19 but in the place of the boil a white swelling or a reddish-white blotch has developed, he must then show himself to the priest. 20 The priest will examine it, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and its hair has turned white, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy that has broken out in the boil. 21 But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and appears faded, the priest will then quarantine him for seven days. 22 And if it has clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is a disease. 23 But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread, it is only the inflammation from the boil, and the priest will declare him clean.\n24 \"Or if someone has a scar from the fire and the raw flesh of the scar becomes a reddish-white blotch or a white one, 25 the priest will then examine it. If the hair in the blotch has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the scar, and the priest will declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy. 26 But if the priest examines it and sees that there is no white hair in the blotch and it is not deeper than the skin and it is faded, the priest will then quarantine him for seven days. 27 The priest will examine him on the seventh day, and if it has clearly spread on the skin, the priest will then declare him unclean. It is the disease of leprosy. 28 But if the blotch stays in one place and has not spread over the skin and it is faded, it is only a swelling of the scar, and the priest will declare him clean, because it is an inflammation of the scar.\n29 \"When a man or a woman develops an infection on the head or on the chin, 30 the priest will then examine the infection. If it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair is yellow and thin, the priest will then declare such one unclean; it is an infection of the scalp or the beard. It is leprosy of the head or of the chin. 31 But if the priest sees that the infection does not appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest should quarantine the infected person for seven days. 32 The priest will examine the infection on the seventh day, and if the infected area has not spread and no yellow hair has developed in it and the appearance of the infected area is not deeper than the skin, 33 the person should have himself shaved, but he will not have the infected area shaved. Then the priest will quarantine the infected person for seven days.\n34 \"The priest will again examine the infected area on the seventh day, and if the infection of the scalp and beard has not spread on the skin and it does not appear deeper than the skin, the priest must then declare him clean, and he should wash his garments and be clean. 35 But if the infection clearly spreads on the skin after his purification, 36 the priest will examine him, and if the infection has spread on the skin, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair; that person is unclean. 37 But if the examination shows that the infection has not spread and black hair has grown on it, the infection has been healed. He is clean, and the priest will declare him clean.\n38 \"If a man or a woman develops blotches on the skin and the blotches are white, 39 the priest will examine them. If the skin blotches are faded white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin. That person is clean.\n40 \"If a man loses the hair of his head and becomes bald, he is clean. 41 If he loses the hair on the front of his head and becomes bald there, he is clean. 42 But if a reddish-white sore develops on the bald part of his scalp or on his forehead, it is leprosy breaking out on his scalp or on his forehead. 43 The priest will examine him, and if the swelling from the infection is reddish-white on the bald spot on top of his head or on his forehead and it looks like leprosy on his skin, 44 he is a leper. He is unclean, and the priest should declare him unclean because of the disease on his head. 45 As for the leper who has the disease, his garments should be torn and his head should be left ungroomed and he should cover over his mustache and call out, 'Unclean, unclean!' 46 He will be unclean the whole time that he has the disease. Since he is unclean, he should live in isolation. His dwelling place will be outside the camp.\n47 \"If the disease of leprosy contaminates a garment, whether a woolen or a linen garment, 48 either in the warp or in the woof of the linen or of the wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin, 49 and the yellowish-green or reddish stain from the disease contaminates the garment, a skin, the warp, the woof, or any article of skin, it is a contamination from leprosy, and it should be shown to the priest. 50 The priest will examine the disease, and he must quarantine the disease for seven days. 51 When he examines the disease on the seventh day and sees that it has spread in the garment, in the warp, in the woof, or in the skin (regardless of what the skin is used for), the disease is malignant leprosy, and it is unclean. 52 He should burn the garment or the warp or the woof in the wool or in the linen or any article of skin in which the disease has developed, for it is malignant leprosy. It should be burned in the fire.\n53 \"But if the priest examines it and the disease has not spread in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, 54 the priest will then command that they should wash the contaminated item, and he will quarantine it for another seven days. 55 The priest will then examine the contaminated item after it has been thoroughly washed. If the appearance of the contamination has not changed, even if the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You should burn it in the fire because it has been eaten away, either from its underside or from its outside.\n56 \"But if the priest has examined it and the contaminated part is faded after it has been thoroughly washed, he will then tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof. 57 However, if it still appears in another part of the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is spreading, and you should burn any contaminated item in the fire. 58 But when the contamination disappears from the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of skin that you wash, it should then be washed a second time, and it will be clean.\n59 \"This is the law of the disease of leprosy in a garment of wool or of linen, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of skin, for declaring it clean or unclean.\"\nChapter 14\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 \"This is to be the law of the leper on the day his purification is established, when he is to be brought to the priest. 3 The priest will go outside the camp and examine him. If the leper has been cured of the leprosy, 4 the priest will command him to bring two live clean birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop for his cleansing. 5 The priest will command that the one bird be killed in an earthenware vessel over running water. 6 But he should take the living bird along with the cedarwood, the scarlet material, and the hyssop, and dip them together in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 7 Then he will spatter it seven times on the one cleansing himself from the leprosy and declare him clean, and he will set the living bird free in the open field.\n8 \"The one cleansing himself must wash his garments and shave off all his hair and bathe in water, and he will be clean. Afterward, he may come into the camp, but he will dwell outside his tent for seven days. 9 On the seventh day, he should shave off all the hair on his head and his chin and his eyebrows. After he shaves off all his hair, he will wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and he will be clean.\n10 \"On the eighth day, he will take two sound young rams, one sound female lamb in its first year, three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log measure of oil; 11 and the priest who declares him clean will present the man who is cleansing himself, along with the offerings, before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 12 The priest will take the one young ram and offer it as a guilt offering together with the log measure of oil, and he will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 13 Then he will slaughter the young ram in the place where the sin offering and the burnt offering are usually slaughtered, in a holy place, because, like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is something most holy.\n14 \"Then the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest will put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 15 And the priest will take some of the log measure of oil and pour it into his own left palm. 16 The priest will then dip his right finger into the oil that is in his left palm and spatter some of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah. 17 Then the priest will put some of the remaining oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot over the blood of the guilt offering. 18 The priest will put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself, and the priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah.\n19 \"The priest will sacrifice the sin offering and make atonement for the one cleansing himself from his impurity, and afterward he will slaughter the burnt offering. 20 And the priest will offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar, and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be clean.\n21 \"However, if he is poor and does not have enough means, he will then take one young ram as a guilt offering for a wave offering, in order to make atonement for himself, along with one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log measure of oil, 22 and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, according to his means. The one will serve as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering. 23 On the eighth day, he will bring them for establishing his purification to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting before Jehovah.\n24 \"The priest will take the young ram of the guilt offering and the log measure of oil, and the priest will wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. 25 He will then slaughter the young ram of the guilt offering, and the priest will take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. 26 The priest will pour some of the oil into his own left palm, 27 and he will then spatter with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before Jehovah. 28 And the priest will put some of the oil that is in his palm on the right earlobe of the one cleansing himself and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot on the same places that he put the blood of the guilt offering. 29 The priest will then put what is left over of the oil in his palm on the head of the one cleansing himself, in order to make atonement for him before Jehovah.\n30 \"He will offer up one of the turtledoves or one of the young pigeons, according to his means, 31 the one he can afford, as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering along with the grain offering; and the priest will make atonement for the one cleansing himself before Jehovah.\n32 \"This is the law for the one in whom the disease of leprosy was but who does not have the means when establishing his purification.\"\n33 Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron: 34 \"When you come into the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I contaminate a house in your land with the disease of leprosy, 35 the one to whom the house belongs should then come and tell the priest, 'Some kind of contamination has appeared in my house.' 36 The priest will give orders to clear out the house before he comes to examine the contamination, in order that he may not declare everything that is in the house unclean; and after that the priest will come in to inspect the house. 37 He will examine the affected area, and if the walls of the house are contaminated with yellowish-green or reddish depressions and they appear to be deeper than the wall surface, 38 the priest will then go out of the house to the entryway of the house and quarantine the house for seven days.\n39 \"Then the priest will return on the seventh day and make an inspection. If the contamination has spread in the walls of the house, 40 the priest will then give orders, and the contaminated stones must be torn out and thrown outside the city into an unclean place. 41 Then he is to have the inside of the house thoroughly scraped, and the plaster and mortar that is removed should be discarded outside the city in an unclean place. 42 They will then insert other stones in the place of the stones they removed, and he should use different mortar and have the house plastered.\n43 \"If, though, the contamination returns and breaks out in the house after the stones were torn out and the house was scraped and replastered, 44 the priest will then go in and inspect it. If the contamination has spread in the house, it is malignant leprosy in the house. The house is unclean. 45 He will then have the house pulled down-its stones, its timbers, and all the plaster and mortar of the house-and carried outside the city to an unclean place. 46 But whoever enters the house any of the days it is quarantined will be unclean until the evening; 47 and whoever lies down in the house should wash his garments, and whoever eats in the house should wash his garments.\n48 \"However, if the priest comes and sees that the contamination has not spread in the house after the house was replastered, the priest will then declare the house clean, because the contamination has been healed. 49 In order to purify the house from uncleanness, he will take two birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop. 50 He is to kill the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water. 51 Then he will take the cedarwood, the hyssop, the scarlet material, and the live bird and dip them in the blood of the bird that was killed and in the running water, and he must spatter it toward the house seven times. 52 And he will purify the house from uncleanness with the blood of the bird, the running water, the live bird, the cedarwood, the hyssop, and the scarlet material. 53 He will then set the live bird free outside the city in the open field and make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.\n54 \"This is the law respecting any case of leprosy, infection of the scalp or the beard, 55 leprosy of the garment or the house, 56 and respecting swellings, scabs, and blotches, 57 in order to determine when something is unclean and when something is clean. This is the law about leprosy.\"\nChapter 15\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'If a man has a discharge from his genital organ, this discharge makes him unclean. 3 He is unclean from the discharge, whether the discharge continues to flow from his genitals or is obstructed, he is still unclean.\n4 \"'Any bed that the one with the discharge lies on will be unclean, and anything he sits on will be unclean. 5 A man who touches his bed must wash his garments, and he should bathe in water and be unclean until the evening. 6 Anyone who sits on an article that the one having a discharge sat on should wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 7 Whoever touches the flesh of the one having a discharge should wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 8 If the one who has a discharge spits on someone clean, that person must wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 9 Any saddle that the one with the discharge rides on will be unclean. 10 Anyone touching anything that was under him will be unclean until the evening, and anyone who carries those items will wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 11 If the one with the discharge has not washed his hands in water and he touches someone, that person must then wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 12 An earthenware vessel that the one having a discharge touches should be smashed, and any wooden vessel should be washed with water.\n13 \"'When the discharge stops and the person becomes clean from it, he will then count seven days for his purification, and he must wash his garments, bathe himself in running water, and he will be clean. 14 On the eighth day, he should take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest. 15 And the priest will offer them, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and the priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah concerning his discharge.\n16 \"'Now if a man has an emission of semen, he should bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until the evening. 17 He must wash with water any garment and any skin with semen on it, and it will be unclean until the evening.\n18 \"'When a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, they should bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.\n19 \"'If a woman has a discharge of blood from her body, she will continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days. Anyone touching her will be unclean until the evening. 20 Anything she lies down on in her menstrual impurity will be unclean, and everything she sits on will be unclean. 21 Anyone touching her bed should wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 22 Anyone touching any article she sat on should wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening. 23 If she sat on the bed or on another article, his touching it will make him unclean until the evening. 24 And if a man lies down with her and her menstrual impurity comes on him, he will then be unclean for seven days, and any bed on which he lies down will be unclean.\n25 \"'When a woman's discharge of blood flows for many days when it is not the regular time of her menstruation, or if she should have a flow longer than her usual menstruation, she will be unclean during all the days of her discharge, as in the days of her menstrual impurity. 26 Any bed she lies on during the days of her discharge will become like the bed of her menstrual impurity, and any article she sits on will become unclean like the uncleanness of her menstrual impurity. 27 Anyone touching them will be unclean, and he must wash his garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.\n28 \"'However, when she is clean from her discharge, she will count for herself seven days, and afterward she will be clean. 29 On the eighth day, she should take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and she will bring them to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 30 The priest will make the one a sin offering and the other a burnt offering, and the priest will make atonement for her before Jehovah concerning her unclean discharge.\n31 \"'Thus you must keep the Israelites separate from their uncleanness, so that they do not die in their uncleanness by defiling my tabernacle, which is in their midst.\n32 \"'This is the law about the man having a discharge, the man who is unclean because of an emission of semen, 33 the woman during her menstrual impurity, any male or female who has a discharge flowing from the body, and a man who lies down with an unclean woman.'\"\nChapter 16\n1 Jehovah spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron's two sons who died for approaching Jehovah. 2 Jehovah said to Moses: \"Tell Aaron your brother that he may not come at just any time into the holy place inside the curtain, in front of the cover on the Ark, so that he may not die, for I will appear over the cover in a cloud.\n3 \"This is what Aaron should bring when he comes into the holy place: a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 4 He should put on the holy linen robe, and the linen shorts should cover his body, and he should wrap himself with the linen sash and his head with the linen turban. They are holy garments. He will bathe himself in water and put them on.\n5 \"He should take from the assembly of the Israelites two young male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.\n6 \"Aaron must then present the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and he will make atonement in behalf of himself and his house.\n7 \"He will then take the two goats and make them stand before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 8 Aaron will draw lots over the two goats, the one lot for Jehovah and the other lot for Azazel. 9 Aaron will present the goat that was designated by lot for Jehovah and make it a sin offering. 10 But the goat designated by lot for Azazel should be brought alive to stand before Jehovah in order to perform the atonement upon it, so that it may be sent away for Azazel into the wilderness.\n11 \"Aaron will present the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement in behalf of himself and his house; afterward he will slaughter the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself.\n12 \"He will then take the fire holder full of burning coals from the altar before Jehovah and two handfuls of fine perfumed incense, and he will bring them inside the curtain. 13 He will also put the incense on the fire before Jehovah, and the cloud of the incense will envelop the Ark cover, which is on the Testimony, so that he may not die.\n14 \"He will take some of the bull's blood and spatter it with his finger in front of the cover on the east side, and he will spatter some of the blood with his finger seven times before the cover.\n15 \"He will then slaughter the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the curtain and do with its blood the same as he did with the bull's blood; he is to spatter it toward the cover and before the cover.\n16 \"He must make atonement for the holy place concerning the acts of uncleanness of the Israelites and concerning their transgressions and their sins, and that is what he should do for the tent of meeting, which is located among them in the midst of their acts of uncleanness.\n17 \"No other man should be in the tent of meeting from the time he goes in to make atonement in the holy place until he comes out. He will make atonement in behalf of himself and his house and in behalf of the entire congregation of Israel.\n18 \"He will then come out to the altar, which is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and he will take some of the bull's blood and some of the goat's blood and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides. 19 He will also spatter some of the blood on it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and sanctify it from the acts of uncleanness of the Israelites.\n20 \"When he has finished making atonement for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he will also present the live goat. 21 Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the errors of the Israelites and all their transgressions and all their sins, and he will put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man designated to do this. 22 The goat will carry upon itself all their errors into a desert land, and he will send the goat away into the wilderness.\n23 \"Aaron will then enter into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the holy place, and he will lay them down there. 24 He must bathe himself in water in a holy place and put on his garments; then he will come out and offer up his burnt offering and the people's burnt offering and make atonement in his own behalf and in behalf of the people. 25 He will make the fat of the sin offering smoke on the altar.\n26 \"The man who sent away the goat for Azazel should wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and after that he may come into the camp.\n27 \"And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the holy place to make atonement, will be taken outside the camp, and their skins and their flesh and their dung will be burned in the fire. 28 The one who burns them should wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and after that he may come into the camp.\n29 \"It will serve as a lasting statute for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, you should afflict yourselves, and you must not do any work, whether a native or a foreigner who is residing among you. 30 On this day atonement will be made for you, to declare you clean. You will be clean from all your sins before Jehovah. 31 It is a sabbath of complete rest for you, and you should afflict yourselves. It is a lasting statute.\n32 \"The priest who is anointed and installed to serve as priest in place of his father will make atonement and put on the linen garments, the holy garments. 33 He will make atonement for the holy sanctuary, the tent of meeting, and the altar; and he will make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the congregation. 34 This will serve as a lasting statute for you, to make atonement for the Israelites concerning all their sins once each year.\"\nSo he did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\nChapter 17\n1 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: 2 \"Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and say to them, 'This is what Jehovah has commanded:\n3 \"'\"If any man of the house of Israel slaughters a bull or a young ram or a goat in the camp or if he slaughters it outside the camp, 4 instead of bringing it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah, bloodguilt will be counted to that man. He has shed blood, and that man must be cut off from among his people. 5 This is so that the Israelites will bring the sacrifices, which they now sacrifice in the open field, to Jehovah, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, to the priest. They are to sacrifice these as communion sacrifices to Jehovah. 6 And the priest will sprinkle the blood on Jehovah's altar at the entrance of the tent of meeting and make the fat smoke as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 7 So they should no longer offer sacrifices to the goatlike demons, with which they are prostituting themselves. This will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations.\"'\n8 \"You should say to them, 'Any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst who offers up a burnt offering or a sacrifice 9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to Jehovah must be cut off from his people.\n10 \"'If any man of the house of Israel or any foreigner who is residing in your midst eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people. 11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I myself have given it on the altar for you to make atonement for yourselves, because it is the blood that makes atonement by means of the life in it. 12 That is why I have said to the Israelites: \"None of you should eat blood, and no foreigner who is residing in your midst should eat blood.\"\n13 \"'If one of the Israelites or some foreigner who is residing in your midst is hunting and catches a wild animal or a bird that may be eaten, he must pour its blood out and cover it with dust. 14 For the life of every sort of flesh is its blood, because the life is in it. Consequently, I said to the Israelites: \"You must not eat the blood of any sort of flesh because the life of every sort of flesh is its blood. Anyone eating it will be cut off.\" 15 If anyone, whether a native or a foreigner, eats an animal found dead or one torn by a wild animal, he must then wash his garments and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening; then he will be clean. 16 But if he does not wash them and does not bathe himself, he will answer for his error.'\"\nChapter 18\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and say to them, 'I am Jehovah your God. 3 You must not behave as they do in the land of Egypt, where you were dwelling, and you must not do what they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you.

Slaves born in his house may also share in eating his food. 12 If the daughter of a priest should marry someone who is not a priest, she may not eat of the contribution of the holy things. 13 But if the daughter of a priest should become a widow or is divorced and she has no offspring and she returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat some of her father's food; but no unauthorized person may eat it.\n14 \"'Now if a man eats a holy thing by mistake, he must add a fifth of its value and give the holy offering to the priest. 15 So they should not profane the holy things of the Israelites that they contribute to Jehovah 16 and cause them to incur punishment for their guilt because of eating their holy things; for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying them.'\"\n17 Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying: 18 \"Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and say to them, 'When an Israelite man or a foreign resident in Israel presents a burnt offering to Jehovah to fulfill his vows or to make a voluntary offering, 19 he should present a sound male from the herd, the young rams, or the goats, in order to gain approval. 20 You must not present anything with a defect, for it will not serve to gain approval for you.\n21 \"'If a man presents a communion sacrifice to Jehovah to pay a vow or as a voluntary offering, it should be a sound animal from the herd or the flock, in order to gain approval. No defect at all should be in it. 22 No offering should be blind, have a fracture, a cut, a wart, scabbiness, or ringworm; you must not present any of these to Jehovah or make such an offering on the altar for Jehovah. 23 You may present a bull or a sheep with a limb that is too long or too short as a voluntary offering, but it will not be accepted with approval as a vow offering. 24 You must not present to Jehovah one having the testicles damaged or crushed or pulled off or cut off, and you should not offer such animals in your land. 25 And you must not present any of these from the hand of a foreigner as the bread of your God, for they are corrupted and defective. They will not be accepted with approval for you.'\"\n26 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 27 \"When a bull or a young ram or a goat is born, it will continue with its mother for seven days, but from the eighth day forward it will be accepted with approval as an offering, an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 28 As for a bull or a sheep, you must not slaughter it and its young on the same day.\n29 \"If you sacrifice a thanksgiving sacrifice to Jehovah, you should sacrifice it to gain approval for yourselves. 30 It should be eaten on that day. You must not leave any of it until morning. I am Jehovah.\n31 \"You must keep my commandments and carry them out. I am Jehovah. 32 You must not profane my holy name, and I must be sanctified in the midst of the Israelites. I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying you, 33 the one bringing you out of the land of Egypt to prove myself God to you. I am Jehovah.\"\nChapter 23\n1 Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'The seasonal festivals of Jehovah that you should proclaim are holy conventions. These are my seasonal festivals:\n3 \"'Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convention. You may not do any sort of work. It is to be a sabbath to Jehovah wherever you dwell.\n4 \"'These are the seasonal festivals of Jehovah, holy conventions that you should proclaim at the times appointed for them: 5 In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, at twilight is the Passover to Jehovah.\n6 \"'On the 15th day of this month is the Festival of Unleavened Bread to Jehovah. Seven days you should eat unleavened bread. 7 On the first day, you will observe a holy convention. You should not do any hard work. 8 But you are to present an offering made by fire to Jehovah for seven days. There will be a holy convention on the seventh day. You should not do any hard work.'\"\n9 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 10 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'When you eventually come into the land that I am giving you and you have reaped its harvest, you must bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest. 11 And he will wave the sheaf back and forth before Jehovah to gain approval for you. The priest should wave it on the day after the Sabbath. 12 On the day you have the sheaf waved, you must offer a sound young ram in its first year, as a burnt offering to Jehovah. 13 Its grain offering will be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as an offering made by fire to Jehovah, a pleasing aroma. Its drink offering will be a fourth of a hin of wine. 14 You must not eat any bread, roasted grain, or new grain until this day, until you bring the offering of your God. It is a lasting statute for all your generations wherever you dwell.\n15 \"'You are to count seven sabbaths from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you bring the sheaf of the wave offering. They should be complete weeks. 16 You will count off 50 days until the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then you should present a new grain offering to Jehovah. 17 You should bring from your dwelling places two loaves as a wave offering. These should be made of two tenths of an ephah of fine flour. They should be baked with leaven, as first ripe fruits to Jehovah. 18 And you should present along with the loaves seven sound male lambs, each a year old, and one young bull and two rams. They will serve as a burnt offering to Jehovah along with the corresponding grain offering and drink offerings, as an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 19 And you must offer one young goat as a sin offering and two male lambs, each a year old, as a communion sacrifice. 20 The priest will wave them back and forth along with the loaves of the first ripe fruits, as a wave offering before Jehovah, together with the two male lambs. They should serve as something holy to Jehovah for the priest. 21 On this day you will make a proclamation for a holy convention for yourselves. You may not do any hard work. It is a lasting statute in all your dwelling places for all your generations.\n22 \"'When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not reap the edge of your field completely and you should not pick up what is left from your harvest. You should leave it for the poor and for the foreign resident. I am Jehovah your God.'\"\n23 Jehovah went on speaking to Moses, saying: 24 \"Tell the Israelites, 'In the seventh month, on the first of the month, you should observe a complete rest, a memorial signaled by a trumpet blast, a holy convention. 25 You may not do any hard work, and you will present an offering made by fire to Jehovah.'\"\n26 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 27 \"However, on the tenth of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. You should observe a holy convention, and you must afflict yourselves and present an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 28 You are not to do any sort of work on this particular day because it is a day of atonement to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God. 29 Anyone who will not afflict himself on this day will be cut off from his people. 30 And I will destroy from among his people every person who does any sort of work on this day. 31 You must not do any sort of work. It is a lasting statute for all your generations wherever you dwell. 32 It is a sabbath of complete rest for you, and you will afflict yourselves on the ninth of the month in the evening. You should observe your sabbath from evening to evening.\"\n33 Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying: 34 \"Tell the Israelites, 'On the 15th day of this seventh month is the Festival of Booths for seven days to Jehovah. 35 There is to be a holy convention on the first day, and you should not do any hard work. 36 Seven days you must present an offering made by fire to Jehovah. On the eighth day, you should observe a holy convention, and you should present an offering made by fire to Jehovah. It is a solemn assembly. You may not do any hard work.\n37 \"'These are the seasonal festivals of Jehovah that you should proclaim as holy conventions for presenting an offering made by fire to Jehovah: the burnt offering and the grain offering of the sacrifice and the drink offerings according to the daily schedule. 38 These are in addition to what is offered on Jehovah's sabbaths, and your gifts, your vow offerings, and your voluntary offerings, which you should give to Jehovah. 39 However, on the 15th day of the seventh month, when you have gathered the produce of the land, you should celebrate the festival of Jehovah for seven days. On the first day is a complete rest and on the eighth day is a complete rest. 40 On the first day, you will take the fruit of majestic trees, the fronds of palm trees, the branches of leafy trees and poplars of the valley, and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days. 41 You will celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah for seven days in the year. As a lasting statute during all your generations, you should celebrate it in the seventh month. 42 You should dwell in the booths for seven days. All the natives in Israel should dwell in the booths, 43 so that your future generations may know that it was in the booths that I made the Israelites dwell when I was bringing them out of the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.'\"\n44 So Moses spoke of the seasonal festivals of Jehovah to the Israelites.\nChapter 24\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 \"Command the Israelites to bring to you pure, beaten olive oil for the lights, to keep the lamps lit constantly. 3 Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron should arrange to keep the lamps lit from evening to morning before Jehovah constantly. It is a permanent statute for all your generations. 4 He should set the lamps in order on the lampstand of pure gold before Jehovah constantly.\n5 \"You will take fine flour and bake it into 12 ring-shaped loaves. Two tenths of an ephah should go into each loaf. 6 You will place them in two sets of layers, six to the layer set, on the table of pure gold before Jehovah. 7 You should put pure frankincense on each layer set, and it will serve as the bread for a token offering made by fire to Jehovah. 8 On each Sabbath day, he should regularly arrange it before Jehovah. It is a lasting covenant with the Israelites. 9 It will become Aaron's and his sons', and they will eat it in a holy place, because it is something most holy for him from Jehovah's offerings made by fire, as a lasting regulation.\"\n10 Now among the Israelites was a son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man, and a fight broke out between him and an Israelite man in the camp. 11 The son of the Israelite woman began to abuse the Name and to curse it. So they brought him to Moses. Incidentally, his mother was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan. 12 They placed him in custody until Jehovah's decision was made clear to them.\n13 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 14 \"Bring the one who cursed to the outside of the camp, and all those who heard him must lay their hands on his head, and then the entire assembly must stone him. 15 And you should tell the Israelites, 'If any man curses his God, he will answer for his sin. 16 So the abuser of Jehovah's name should be put to death without fail. The entire assembly should stone him without fail. The foreign resident should be put to death the same as the native for his abusing the Name.\n17 \"'If a man takes a human life, he should be put to death without fail. 18 Anyone who strikes and kills a domestic animal should make compensation for it, life for life. 19 If a man injures his fellow man, then what he has done should be done to him. 20 Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, the same sort of injury he inflicted should be inflicted on him. 21 The man who strikes and kills an animal should make compensation for it, but the one who strikes and kills a man should be put to death.\n22 \"'One judicial decision will apply for you, whether a foreign resident or a native, because I am Jehovah your God.'\"\n23 Moses then spoke to the Israelites, and they brought the one who uttered the curse to the outside of the camp, and they stoned him. Thus the Israelites did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\nChapter 25\n1 Jehovah spoke further to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'When you eventually come into the land that I am giving you, then the land will observe a sabbath to Jehovah. 3 Six years you should sow your field with seed, and six years you should prune your vineyard, and you will gather the land's produce. 4 But in the seventh year, there should be a sabbath of complete rest for the land, a sabbath to Jehovah. You should not sow your field with seed or prune your vineyard. 5 You must not reap what grows on its own from the grain left after the harvest, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you must not gather. There should be a year of complete rest for the land. 6 However, you may eat the food that grows in the land during its sabbath; you, your male and female slaves, your hired worker, and the foreign settlers who are residing with you may eat it, 7 as well as the domestic and the wild animals in your land. Everything the land produces may be eaten.\n8 \"'You will count off seven sabbath years, seven times seven years, and the days of the seven sabbath years will amount to 49 years. 9 You will then sound the horn loudly in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month; on the Day of Atonement, you should cause the sound of the horn to be heard in all your land. 10 You must sanctify the 50th year and proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants. It will become a Jubilee for you, and each of you will return to his property and each of you should return to his family. 11 A Jubilee is what that 50th year will become for you. You will not sow seed or reap what grew on its own from leftover grain nor gather the grapes of unpruned vines. 12 For it is a Jubilee. It is to be holy to you. You may eat only what the land produces by itself.\n13 \"'In this year of the Jubilee, each of you should return to his property. 14 If you sell anything to your fellow man or if you buy from him, do not exploit one another. 15 You should buy from your fellow man, taking into account the number of the years after the Jubilee, and he should sell to you according to the remaining years for crops. 16 If there are many years remaining, he may increase its purchase price, and when there are few years left, he should reduce its purchase price, because he is selling you the number of crops to be produced. 17 No one among you should exploit his fellow man, and you must be in fear of your God, for I am Jehovah your God. 18 By your carrying out my statutes and keeping my judicial decisions, you will dwell in security in the land. 19 The land will give its fruitage, and you will eat to satisfaction and dwell there in security.\n20 \"'But if you should say: \"What will we eat in the seventh year if we may not sow seed or gather our crops?\" 21 I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year, and the land will yield a crop sufficient for three years. 22 Then you will sow seed in the eighth year and eat from the old crop until the ninth year. Until its crop arrives, you will eat from the old.\n23 \"'The land should not be sold on a permanent basis, because the land is mine. For you are foreign residents and settlers from my standpoint. 24 Throughout the land of your possession, you should grant the right of buying back the land.\n25 \"'If your brother becomes poor and has to sell some of his property, a repurchaser who is closely related to him must come and buy back what his brother sold. 26 If anyone has no repurchaser but he becomes prosperous and finds the means to repurchase it, 27 he should calculate its value for the years since he sold it and refund the difference to the man whom he sold it to. Then he may return to his property.\n28 \"'But if he does not find the means to get it back from him, what he sold will remain with the purchaser until the Jubilee year; and it will revert to him in the Jubilee, and he will return to his property.\n29 \"'Now if a man should sell a home in a walled city, his right of repurchase will also continue until the end of the year from the time of his completing the sale; his right of repurchase will be valid a whole year. 30 But if it is not bought back by the end of one full year, the house within the walled city will become the permanent property of its purchaser throughout his generations. It should not be released in the Jubilee. 31 However, the houses of settlements with no surrounding wall should be considered to be part of the field of the countryside. The right of repurchase should continue for it, and it should be released in the Jubilee.\n32 \"'As for the houses of the Levites within their cities, the Levites will have the permanent right to repurchase them. 33 When the property of the Levites is not bought back, the house sold in the city belonging to them will also be released in the Jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. 34 Moreover, the field of pasture ground surrounding their cities may not be sold, for it is their permanent possession.\n35 \"'If your brother who is nearby becomes poor and cannot support himself, you must sustain him as you would a foreign resident and a settler, so that he may keep alive with you. 36 Do not take interest or make a profit from him. You must be in fear of your God, and your brother will keep alive with you. 37 You must not lend him your money on interest or give out your food for profit. 38 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to prove myself your God.\n39 \"'If your brother who lives nearby becomes poor and he has to sell himself to you, you must not force him to do slave labor. 40 He should be treated like a hired worker, like a settler. He should serve with you until the Jubilee year. 41 Then he will leave you, he and his children with him, and return to his family. He should return to the property of his forefathers. 42 For they are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They should not sell themselves the way a slave is sold. 43 You must not treat him cruelly, and you must be in fear of your God. 44 Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you, from them you may buy a male or a female slave. 45 Also from the sons of the foreign settlers who are residing with you, from them and from their families that are born to them in your land you may buy slaves, and they will become your possession. 46 You may pass them on as an inheritance to your sons after you to inherit as a permanent possession. You may use them as workers, but you must not subject your Israelite brothers to cruel treatment.\n47 \"'But if a foreign resident or a settler among you becomes wealthy and your brother has become poor alongside him and must sell himself to the foreign resident or the settler who lives among you, or to a member of the family of the foreign resident, 48 he will continue to have the right of repurchase after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may buy him back, 49 or his uncle or the son of his uncle may buy him back, or any close relative, one of his family, may buy him back.\n\"'Or if he himself has become wealthy, he may also buy himself back. 50 He should calculate with his purchaser the time from the year he sold himself to him until the Jubilee year, and the money of his sale will correspond to the number of years. His workdays during that time will be assessed at the rate of a hired worker. 51 If there are many years remaining, he should pay his repurchase price in proportion to the years that are left. 52 But if only a few years remain until the Jubilee year, he should then calculate for himself and pay his repurchase price in proportion to the years remaining. 53 He should continue to serve him year by year as a hired worker; and you should see to it that he does not treat him cruelly. 54 However, if he cannot buy himself back on these terms, he will then go free in the year of Jubilee, he and his children with him.\n55 \"'For the Israelites are my own slaves. They are my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.\nChapter 26\n1 \"'You must not make worthless gods for yourselves, and you must not set up a carved image or a sacred pillar for yourselves, and you must not put a stone figure in your land in order to bow down toward it; for I am Jehovah your God. 2 You should keep my sabbaths and show reverence for my sanctuary. I am Jehovah.\n3 \"'If you continue walking in my statutes and keeping my commandments and you carry them out, 4 I will give you showers of rain at their proper time, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will give their fruit. 5 Your threshing season will extend until your grape harvest, and the grape harvest will extend until the sowing season; and you will eat your bread to satisfaction and dwell in security in your land. 6 I will put peace in the land, and you will lie down with no one making you afraid; and I will rid the land of vicious wild animals, and a sword of war will not pass through your land. 7 You will certainly pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword. 8 Five of you will pursue 100, and 100 of you will pursue 10,000, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.\n9 \"'I will direct my favor to you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will keep my covenant with you. 10 While you are still eating the old produce of the preceding year, you will need to clear out the old to make way for the new. 11 And I will place my tabernacle in your midst, and I will not reject you. 12 I will walk among you and be your God, and you for your part will be my people. 13 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be their slaves no longer, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk with heads held high.\n14 \"'However, if you will not listen to me or keep all these commandments, 15 and if you reject my statutes, and if you abhor my judicial decisions so that you do not keep all my commandments, and you violate my covenant, 16 I, for my part, will do the following to you: I will punish you with distress, with tuberculosis and burning fever, making your eyes fail and your life waste away. You will sow your seed simply for nothing, for your enemies will eat it. 17 I will set my face against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies; and those who hate you will tread on you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you.\n18 \"'If even this does not make you listen to me, I will have to chastise you seven times as much for your sins. 19 I will break your stubborn pride and make your heavens like iron and your earth like copper. 20 You will exhaust your strength for nothing, as your land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not produce fruit.\n21 \"'But if you keep walking in opposition to me and refuse to listen to me, I will then have to strike you seven times as much, according to your sins. 22 I will send the wild animals of the field among you, and they will bereave you of children and annihilate your domestic animals and reduce your numbers, and your roads will be deserted.\n23 \"'If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction and you insist on walking in opposition to me, 24 then I too will walk in opposition to you, and I myself will strike you seven times for your sins. 25 I will bring an avenging sword upon you for breaking the covenant. If you gather yourselves into your cities, I will send disease into your midst, and you will be given into the hand of an enemy. 26 When I destroy your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in only one oven and then ration your bread by weight; and you will eat but you will not be satisfied.\n27 \"'If in spite of this you will not listen to me and you insist on walking in opposition to me, 28 I will intensify my opposition to you, and I myself will have to chastise you seven times for your sins. 29 So you will have to eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters. 30 I will annihilate your sacred high places and cut down your incense stands and pile your carcasses on the carcasses of your disgusting idols, and I will turn away from you in disgust. 31 I will give your cities to the sword and make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell the pleasing aromas of your sacrifices. 32 I myself will make the land desolate, and your enemies who are dwelling in it will stare in amazement over it. 33 And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will unsheathe a sword after you; and your land will be made desolate, and your cities will be devastated.\n34 \"'At that time the land will pay off its sabbaths all the days it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time the land will rest, as it must repay its sabbaths. 35 All the days it lies desolate it will rest, because it did not rest during your sabbaths when you were dwelling on it.\n36 \"'As for those who survive, I will fill their hearts with despair in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a blowing leaf will cause them to flee, and they will flee like someone running from the sword and fall without anyone pursuing them. 37 They will stumble over one another like those running from a sword, though no one is pursuing them. You will not be able to resist your enemies. 38 You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you. 39 Those of you who remain will be left to rot in the lands of your enemies because of your error. Yes, they will rot away because of the errors of their fathers. 40 Then they will confess their own error and the error and unfaithfulness of their fathers and admit that they behaved unfaithfully by walking in opposition to me. 41 Then I also walked in opposition to them by bringing them into the land of their enemies.\n\"'Perhaps then their uncircumcised heart will be humbled, and then they will pay off their error. 42 And I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and my covenant with Isaac, and I will remember my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. 43 While the land was abandoned by them, it was paying off its sabbaths and lying desolate without them, and they were paying for their error, because they rejected my judicial decisions and they abhorred my statutes. 44 But despite all of this, while they are in the land of their enemies, I will never completely reject them nor cast them away to the point of exterminating them, which would violate my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God. 45 For their sakes I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Egypt under the eyes of the nations, in order to prove myself their God. I am Jehovah.'\"\n46 These are the regulations, the judicial decisions, and the laws that Jehovah established between himself and the Israelites on Mount Sinai through Moses.\nChapter 27\n1 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'If a man makes a special vow to offer the estimated value of a person to Jehovah, 3 the estimated value of a male from 20 to 60 years old will be 50 shekels of silver by the standard shekel of the holy place. 4 But if it is a female, the estimated value will be 30 shekels. 5 If the age is from 5 to 20 years old, the estimated value of the male will be 20 shekels and 10 shekels for the female. 6 If the age is from one month up to five years old, the estimated value of the male will be five shekels of silver and three shekels of silver for the female.\n7 \"'If the age is 60 years and over, the estimated value will be 15 shekels for the male and 10 shekels for the female. 8 But if he is too poor to pay the estimated value, the person will stand before the priest, and the priest will set a value on him. The priest will make the valuation according to what the one making the vow can afford.\n9 \"'If the vow involves an animal that is suitable for offering to Jehovah, whatever may be given to Jehovah will become something holy. 10 He may not replace it or exchange it with good for bad or with bad for good. But if he should exchange it with one animal for another animal, the original and what is exchanged for it will both become holy. 11 If it is an unclean animal that may not be presented as an offering to Jehovah, he will then stand the animal before the priest. 12 The priest will then set its value, as to whether it is good or bad. The value estimated by the priest will stand. 13 But if he ever wants to buy it back, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to the estimated value.\n14 \"'Now if a man should sanctify his house as something holy to Jehovah, the priest will then set its value, whether it is good or bad. According to the value that the priest sets, that is what it will cost. 15 But if the one who sanctifies his house wants to buy it back, he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it, and it will become his.\n16 \"'If a man sanctifies to Jehovah some of the field that he possesses, the value will be estimated in proportion to the seed needed to sow it: a homer of barley seed will be 50 shekels of silver. 17 If he sanctifies his field from the year of Jubilee, the estimated value stands. 18 If he sanctifies his field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate for him the price in proportion to the years that are left until the next year of Jubilee, and a deduction should be made from the estimated value. 19 But if the one who sanctified it should ever buy the field back, he must then give a fifth of the money of the estimated value in addition to it, and it will remain his. 20 Now if he should not buy the field back and the field is sold to another man, it may not be bought back again. 21 When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become something holy to Jehovah, as a field that is devoted to him. It will become the property of the priests.\n22 \"'If a man sanctifies to Jehovah a field he purchased that is not part of his hereditary property, 23 the priest will calculate for him the amount of the valuation up until the year of Jubilee, and he will give the estimated value on that day. It is something holy to Jehovah. 24 In the year of Jubilee, the field will return to the one he bought it from, to the one the land belongs to.\n25 \"'Every value should be estimated by the standard shekel of the holy place. The shekel should amount to 20 gerahs.\n26 \"'However, no one should sanctify the firstborn of the animals, since it is born as the firstborn for Jehovah. Whether bull or sheep, it already belongs to Jehovah. 27 If it is among the unclean animals and he redeems it according to the estimated value, he should give a fifth of it in addition to it. But if it is not bought back, it will be sold according to the estimated value.\n28 \"'But no devoted thing that a man devotes unconditionally to Jehovah from his belongings may be sold or bought back, whether from mankind or animals or the field he possesses. Every devoted thing is something most holy to Jehovah. 29 Furthermore, no condemned person who is set apart for destruction may be redeemed. He should be put to death without fail.\n30 \"'Every tenth part of the land, whether from the produce of the field or the fruit of the trees, belongs to Jehovah. It is something holy to Jehovah. 31 If a man ever wants to buy any of his tenth part back, he should give a fifth of it in addition to it. 32 As for every tenth part of the herd and flock, everything that passes under the shepherd's staff, the tenth animal should become something holy to Jehovah. 33 He should not examine whether it is good or bad, neither should he exchange it. But if he would ever try to exchange it, both the original and what is exchanged for it should become something holy. It may not be bought back.'\"\n34 These are the commandments that Jehovah gave to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai. \n",

He said: 2 \"Take a census of the whole assembly of the Israelites individually according to their families, according to their paternal houses, according to the count of the names of all the males. 3 You and Aaron are to register by their companies all those from 20 years old and up who can serve in the army in Israel.\n4 \"Take with you one man from each tribe; each one is to be a head of his paternal house. 5 These are the names of the men who will stand with you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur; 6 of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai; 7 of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab; 8 of Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar; 9 of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon; 10 of the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur; 11 of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni; 12 of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai; 13 of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran; 14 of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel; 15 of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan. 16 These are the ones summoned from the assembly. They are the chieftains of the tribes of their fathers, the heads of the thousands of Israel.\"\n17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name. 18 They gathered all the assembly on the first day of the second month, so that they might be registered individually by name, by family, and by their paternal houses, from 20 years old and up, 19 just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. So he registered them in the wilderness of Sinai.\n20 The sons of Reuben, the descendants of Israel's firstborn, were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted individually, 21 and the number registered of the tribe of Reuben was 46,500.\n22 The descendants of Simeon were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted individually, 23 and the number registered of the tribe of Simeon was 59,300.\n24 The descendants of Gad were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 25 and the number registered of the tribe of Gad was 45,650.\n26 The descendants of Judah were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 27 and the number registered of the tribe of Judah was 74,600.\n28 The descendants of Issachar were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 29 and the number registered of the tribe of Issachar was 54,400.\n30 The descendants of Zebulun were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 31 and the number registered of the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400.\n32 The descendants of Joseph through Ephraim were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 33 and the number registered of the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500.\n34 The descendants of Manasseh were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 35 and the number registered of the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200.\n36 The descendants of Benjamin were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 37 and the number registered of the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400.\n38 The descendants of Dan were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 39 and the number registered of the tribe of Dan was 62,700.\n40 The descendants of Asher were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 41 and the number registered of the tribe of Asher was 41,500.\n42 The descendants of Naphtali were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 43 and the number registered of the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400.\n44 These were registered by Moses together with Aaron and the 12 chieftains of Israel, each representing his paternal house. 45 All the Israelites from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army in Israel were registered by their paternal house, 46 and the total number registered was 603,550.\n47 But the Levites were not registered in among them by the tribe of their fathers. 48 So Jehovah told Moses: 49 \"Only the tribe of Levi you are not to register, and you should not include the number of them along with the other Israelites. 50 You should appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony and over all its utensils and over everything that belongs to it. They will carry the tabernacle and all its utensils, and they will minister at it, and they are to camp around the tabernacle. 51 Whenever the tabernacle is to be moved, the Levites should take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be reassembled, the Levites should set it up; and any unauthorized person who comes near should be put to death.\n52 \"Each Israelite should set up his tent in his assigned camp, each man according to his three-tribe division by their companies. 53 And the Levites should encamp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, so that no indignation may arise against the assembly of the Israelites; and the Levites must be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony.\"\n54 The people of Israel did all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.\nChapter 2\n1 Jehovah now spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 \"The Israelites should encamp where their three-tribe division is assigned, each man near the banner of his paternal house. They should camp facing the tent of meeting, all around it.\n3 \"Those camping on the east side, toward the sunrise, will be the three-tribe division of the encampment of Judah by their companies; the chieftain for the sons of Judah is Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 4 Those registered in his army are 74,600. 5 Camping alongside him will be the tribe of Issachar; the chieftain for the sons of Issachar is Nethanel the son of Zuar. 6 Those registered in his army are 54,400. 7 Next is the tribe of Zebulun; the chieftain for the sons of Zebulun is Eliab the son of Helon. 8 Those registered in his army are 57,400.\n9 \"All those registered in the armies of the camp of Judah are 186,400. They should break camp first.\n10 \"The three-tribe division of the encampment of Reuben by their companies will be toward the south; the chieftain for the sons of Reuben is Elizur the son of Shedeur. 11 Those registered in his army are 46,500. 12 Camping alongside him will be the tribe of Simeon; the chieftain for the sons of Simeon is Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 13 Those registered in his army are 59,300. 14 Next is the tribe of Gad; the chieftain for the sons of Gad is Eliasaph the son of Reuel. 15 Those registered in his army are 45,650.\n16 \"All those registered in the armies of the camp of Reuben are 151,450, and they should break camp second.\n17 \"When the tent of meeting is moved, the camp of the Levites should be in the middle of the other camps.\n\"They should travel in the same order as they encamp, with each in his place, according to their three-tribe divisions.\n18 \"The three-tribe division of the encampment of Ephraim by their companies will be toward the west; the chieftain for the sons of Ephraim is Elishama the son of Ammihud. 19 Those registered in his army are 40,500. 20 Next to him will be the tribe of Manasseh; the chieftain for the sons of Manasseh is Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 21 Those registered in his army are 32,200. 22 Next is the tribe of Benjamin; the chieftain for the sons of Benjamin is Abidan the son of Gideoni. 23 Those registered in his army are 35,400.\n24 \"All those registered in the armies of the camp of Ephraim are 108,100, and they should break camp third.\n25 \"The three-tribe division of the encampment of Dan by their companies will be toward the north; the chieftain for the sons of Dan is Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 26 Those registered in his army are 62,700. 27 Camping alongside him will be the tribe of Asher; the chieftain for the sons of Asher is Pagiel the son of Ochran. 28 Those registered in his army are 41,500. 29 Next is the tribe of Naphtali; the chieftain for the sons of Naphtali is Ahira the son of Enan. 30 Those registered in his army are 53,400.\n31 \"All those registered in the camp of Dan are 157,600. They should break camp last, according to their three-tribe divisions.\"\n32 These were the Israelites who were registered according to their paternal houses; the total of those in the camps registered for the army was 603,550. 33 But the Levites did not get registered along with the other Israelites, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 34 The Israelites did everything that Jehovah had commanded Moses. This is how they encamped by their three-tribe divisions and how they broke camp, each by family and according to their paternal houses.\nChapter 3\n1 Now these were the family lines of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai. 2 These were the names of Aaron's sons: the firstborn Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3 These were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests who had been installed to serve as priests. 4 However, Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah when they offered unauthorized fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai, and they did not have any sons. But Eleazar and Ithamar continued to serve as priests along with Aaron their father.\n5 Jehovah then said to Moses: 6 \"Bring the tribe of Levi forward, and stand them before Aaron the priest, and they will minister to him. 7 They are to fulfill their responsibilities toward him and toward all the assembly before the tent of meeting by carrying out their service in connection with the tabernacle. 8 They are to take care of all the equipment of the tent of meeting and to carry out their responsibilities toward the Israelites by taking care of the services related to the tabernacle. 9 You are to give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They are given ones, given to him from the Israelites. 10 You should appoint Aaron and his sons, and they are to carry out their priestly duties, and any unauthorized person who comes near should be put to death.\"\n11 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 12 \"As for me, look! I take the Levites from among the Israelites in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the Levites will become mine. 13 For every firstborn is mine. In the day that I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to myself every firstborn in Israel from man to beast. They are to become mine. I am Jehovah.\"\n14 Jehovah spoke further to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying: 15 \"Register the sons of Levi by their paternal houses and by their families. You should register every male from a month old and up.\" 16 So Moses registered them at the order of Jehovah, just as he had been commanded. 17 These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n18 Now these were the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.\n19 The sons of Kohath by their families were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.\n20 The sons of Merari by their families were Mahli and Mushi.\nThese were the families of the Levites by their paternal houses.\n21 From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites. These were the families of the Gershonites. 22 The number of all their males a month old and up who were registered was 7,500. 23 The families of the Gershonites were encamped behind the tabernacle toward the west. 24 The chieftain of the paternal house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael. 25 The responsibility of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was to care for the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, the screen of the entrance of the tent of meeting, 26 the hanging curtains of the courtyard, the screen of the entrance of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, its tent cords, and all the service connected with these.\n27 From Kohath came the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites. These were the families of the Kohathites. 28 The number of all the males from a month old and up was 8,600; they were responsible for taking care of the holy place. 29 The families of the sons of Kohath camped on the south side of the tabernacle. 30 The chieftain of the paternal house of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 31 Their responsibility was to care for the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils used to minister in the holy place, the screen, and all the service connected with these.\n32 The head chieftain of the Levites was Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, who had the oversight of those taking care of the responsibilities of the holy place.\n33 From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites. These were the families of Merari. 34 The number of all the males from a month old and up who were registered was 6,200. 35 The chieftain of the paternal house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were encamped on the north side of the tabernacle. 36 The sons of Merari were responsible for overseeing the panel frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its socket pedestals, all its utensils, and all the service connected with these, 37 as well as the pillars that were all around the courtyard and their socket pedestals, their tent pins, and their tent cords.\n38 Those camping in front of the tabernacle toward the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons. They were responsible for taking care of the sanctuary as their obligation in behalf of the Israelites. Any unauthorized person coming near would be put to death.\n39 All the Levite males from a month old and up, whom Moses and Aaron registered by their families at the order of Jehovah, were 22,000.\n40 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Register all the firstborn males of the Israelites from a month old and up, count them, and make a list of their names. 41 You must take the Levites for me-I am Jehovah-in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and take the domestic animals of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the domestic animals of the Israelites.\" 42 Moses then registered all the firstborn among the Israelites, just as Jehovah had commanded him. 43 The number of all the firstborn males who were registered by name from a month old and up was 22,273.\n44 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 45 \"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and take the domestic animals of the Levites in place of their domestic animals, and the Levites must become mine. I am Jehovah. 46 As the ransom price of the 273 of the firstborn of the Israelites who are in excess of the Levites, 47 you are to take five shekels for each individual, according to the standard shekel of the holy place. A shekel is 20 gerahs. 48 You are to give the money to Aaron and his sons as the ransom price of those who are in excess of them.\" 49 So Moses took the money of the redemption price from those who were in excess of the ransom price of the Levites. 50 He took the money from the firstborn of the Israelites, 1,365 shekels, according to the standard shekel of the holy place. 51 Then Moses gave the money of the ransom price to Aaron and his sons according to the word of Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\nChapter 4\n1 Jehovah now spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 \"A census should be taken of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families and by their paternal houses, 3 all those from 30 to 50 years old who are in the group assigned to work in the tent of meeting.\n4 \"This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting. It is something most holy: 5 Aaron and his sons will come in when the camp is departing and take down the screening curtain and cover the ark of the Testimony with it. 6 They will put a sealskin covering over it and spread out a solid blue cloth over it and put its carrying poles in place.\n7 \"They will also spread out a blue cloth over the table of showbread, and they will put on it the dishes, the cups, the bowls, and the pitchers of the drink offering; the regular offering of bread should remain on it. 8 They will spread out a scarlet cloth over them and cover it with a sealskin covering and put its carrying poles in place. 9 Then they will take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps, its snuffers, its fire holders, and all its containers for oil that are used to maintain it. 10 They will wrap it and all its utensils in a sealskin covering and put it on a carrying bar. 11 And they will spread out a blue cloth over the golden altar, cover it with a sealskin covering, and put its carrying poles in place. 12 They will then take all the utensils of the ministry with which they regularly minister in the holy place and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a sealskin covering and put them on a carrying bar.\n13 \"They should remove the ashes from the altar and spread out a cloth of purple wool over it. 14 They will put on it all its utensils that are used when they minister at the altar: the fire holders, the forks, the shovels, and the bowls, all the utensils of the altar; and they are to spread a sealskin covering over it and put its carrying poles in place.\n15 \"Aaron and his sons must finish covering the holy place and all the equipment of the holy place when the camp is departing. Then the sons of Kohath will come in to carry them, but they must not touch the holy place or they will die. These things are the responsibility of the sons of Kohath in connection with the tent of meeting.\n16 \"Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is responsible for overseeing the oil of the lighting, the perfumed incense, the regular grain offering, and the anointing oil. He has oversight of the entire tabernacle and all that is in it, including the holy place and its utensils.\"\n17 Jehovah spoke further to Moses and Aaron, saying: 18 \"Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites. 19 But do this for them that they may remain alive and not die because of approaching the most holy things. Aaron and his sons will go in and assign each of them to his service and what he is to carry. 20 They must not come in and see the holy things even for an instant, or they will die.\"\n21 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying: 22 \"A census should be taken of the sons of Gershon by their paternal houses and their families. 23 You are to register all those from 30 to 50 years old who are in the group assigned to serve in the tent of meeting. 24 This is what the families of the Gershonites are assigned to care for and to carry: 25 They will carry the tent cloths of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, its covering and the sealskin covering that is on top over it, the screen of the entrance of the tent of meeting, 26 the hanging curtains of the courtyard, the screen of the entrance of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, their tent cords and all their utensils and everything used in its service. This is their assignment. 27 All the service and the loads of the Gershonites should be overseen by Aaron and his sons; you will assign all these loads as their responsibility. 28 This is the service that the families of the Gershonites are to carry out in the tent of meeting, and their responsibilities are under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.\n29 \"As for the sons of Merari, you will register them by family and by their paternal house. 30 From 30 to 50 years old you will register them, all who are in the group assigned to the service of the tent of meeting. 31 This is what they are responsible for carrying in connection with their service at the tent of meeting: the panel frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its socket pedestals; 32 the pillars of the surrounding courtyard, their socket pedestals, their tent pins, and their tent cords together with all their equipment and all the service connected with these. You will assign to them by name the equipment they are responsible for carrying. 33 This is how the families of the sons of Merari are to serve at the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.\"\n34 Moses and Aaron and the chieftains of the assembly then registered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their paternal house, 35 all those from 30 to 50 years old who were in the group assigned to the service of the tent of meeting. 36 The total of those registered by their families was 2,750. 37 These were registered from the families of the Kohathites, all those who were serving at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron registered them at the order of Jehovah through Moses.\n38 The sons of Gershon were registered by their families and by their paternal house, 39 all those from 30 to 50 years old who were in the group assigned to the service at the tent of meeting. 40 The total of those registered by their families and by their paternal house was 2,630. 41 This was the registration of the families of the sons of Gershon, all those who were serving at the tent of meeting. Moses and Aaron had them registered at the order of Jehovah.\n42 The sons of Merari were registered by their families and by their paternal house, 43 all those from 30 to 50 years old who were in the group assigned to the service at the tent of meeting. 44 The total of those registered of them by their families was 3,200. 45 This was the registration of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron registered at the order of Jehovah through Moses.\n46 Moses and Aaron and the chieftains of Israel registered all these Levites by their families and by their paternal houses; 47 they were from 30 to 50 years old, and all were assigned to serve and carry loads in connection with the tent of meeting. 48 The total of those registered was 8,580. 49 They were registered at the order of Jehovah through Moses, each according to his assigned service and his load; they were registered just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\nChapter 5\n1 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 \"Command the Israelites to send out of the camp every leprous person and everyone having a discharge and everyone unclean by a dead person. 3 Whether a male or a female, you should send them out. You should send them outside the camp, so that they may not contaminate the camps of those in whose midst I am dwelling.\" 4 Therefore, the Israelites did so and sent them outside the camp. Just as Jehovah told Moses, so the Israelites did.\n5 Jehovah continued speaking to Moses, saying: 6 \"Tell the Israelites, 'If a man or a woman commits any of the sins of mankind and acts unfaithfully toward Jehovah, that person has become guilty. 7 He must confess the sin that he has committed and return the full amount as compensation for his guilt and also add a fifth of its value; he is to give it to the one he wronged. 8 But if the victim does not have a close relative to receive the compensation, it should be returned to Jehovah and will belong to the priest, apart from the ram of atonement with which he will make atonement for him.\n9 \"'Every holy contribution from the Israelites that is presented to the priest should become his. 10 The holy things of each person will remain his own. Whatever each one gives to the priest, that will belong to the priest.'\"\n11 Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying: 12 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'This is what should be done if a man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him 13 and another man has sexual relations with her, but it was unknown to her husband and remains undiscovered, so that she has defiled herself but there is no witness against her and she has not been caught: 14 Whether the husband becomes jealous and suspicious of his wife's faithfulness when she has defiled herself, or whether he is jealous and suspicious of his wife's faithfulness when she has not defiled herself, 15 the man must bring his wife to the priest, along with an offering for her, a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He must not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering bringing guilt to mind.\n16 \"'The priest will bring her forward and make her stand before Jehovah. 17 The priest will take holy water in an earthenware vessel, and the priest will take some of the dust from the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water. 18 And the priest will make the woman stand before Jehovah and unbind the woman's hair and put in her palms the grain offering for a reminder, that is, the grain offering of jealousy, and the priest will have in his hand the bitter water that brings a curse.\n19 \"'The priest will then make her swear, saying to the woman: \"If no other man had sexual relations with you while you were under your husband's authority and you have not gone astray and become defiled, may you be free of the effect of this bitter water that brings a curse. 20 But if you have gone astray while under your husband's authority by defiling yourself, and you have had sexual relations with another man besides your husband-\" 21 The priest will then make the woman swear an oath that includes a curse, and the priest will say to the woman: \"May Jehovah make you an object for cursing and for an oath among your people, as Jehovah makes your thigh fall away and causes your abdomen to swell. 22 This water that brings a curse will enter into your intestines to cause your abdomen to swell and make your thigh fall away.\" To this the woman should say: \"Amen! Amen!\"\n23 \"'Then the priest should write these curses in the book and wash them off into the bitter water. 24 He will then make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings a curse will enter into her and produce bitterness. 25 And the priest should take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand and wave the grain offering back and forth before Jehovah, and he will bring it near the altar. 26 The priest will take a handful of the grain offering as a token offering and make it smoke on the altar, and afterward he will make the woman drink the water. 27 When he makes her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and committed an act of unfaithfulness toward her husband, the water that brings a curse will then enter into her and become something bitter, and her abdomen will swell, and her thigh will fall away, and the woman will become an object of cursing among her people. 28 However, if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free from such punishment, and she will be able to conceive and produce offspring.\n29 \"'This is the law about jealousy, when a woman may go astray and defile herself while under her husband's authority, 30 or in the case of a man who becomes jealous and suspects his wife of unfaithfulness; he should make his wife stand before Jehovah, and the priest must carry out toward her all this law. 31 The man will be free from guilt, but his wife will answer for her guilt.'\"\nChapter 6\n1 Jehovah spoke further to Moses and said: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'If a man or a woman takes a special vow to live as a Nazirite to Jehovah, 3 he should keep away from wine and other alcoholic beverages. He should not drink the vinegar of wine or the vinegar of anything alcoholic. He should not drink any liquid made from grapes, nor eat grapes, whether fresh or dried. 4 All the days of his Naziriteship he should not eat anything made from the grapevine, from the unripe grapes to the skins.\n5 \"'All the days of the vow of his Naziriteship no razor should pass over his head. He is to remain holy by letting the hair of his head grow until the days of his being set apart to Jehovah are completed. 6 He should not approach a dead person during all the days he remains separated to Jehovah. 7 Even if his father or his mother or his brother or his sister should die, he may not defile himself, because the sign of his Naziriteship to his God is upon his head.\n8 \"'He is holy to Jehovah all the days of his Naziriteship. 9 But if someone should suddenly die alongside him and he defiles the hair symbolizing his separation to God, he must shave his head on the day he establishes his purification. He should shave it on the seventh day. 10 And on the eighth day, he should bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 11 The priest will prepare one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and make atonement for him for his sin in connection with the dead person. Then he must sanctify his head on that day. 12 And he must separate himself again to Jehovah for the days of his Naziriteship, and he will bring a young ram in its first year as a guilt offering. However, the former days will go uncounted because he defiled his Naziriteship.\n13 \"'Now this is the law about the Nazirite: When he completes the days of his Naziriteship, he will be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting. 14 There he must present his offering to Jehovah: one sound young ram in its first year as a burnt offering, one sound female lamb in its first year as a sin offering, one sound ram as a communion sacrifice, 15 a basket of unleavened ring-shaped loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and their grain offering and their drink offerings. 16 The priest will present them before Jehovah and will offer up his sin offering and his burnt offering. 17 He will offer the ram as a communion sacrifice to Jehovah along with the basket of unleavened loaves, and the priest will present its grain offering and its drink offering.\n18 \"'The Nazirite must then shave the uncut hair of his head at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and he will take the hair of his head grown during his Naziriteship and put it on the fire that is under the communion sacrifice. 19 And the priest must take a boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened ring-shaped loaf from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them on the palms of the Nazirite after he has had the sign of his Naziriteship shaved off. 20 And the priest must wave them back and forth as a wave offering before Jehovah. It is something holy for the priest, along with the breast of the wave offering and the leg of the contribution. Afterward, the Nazirite may drink wine.\n21 \"'This is the law about the Nazirite who makes a vow: If he vows and can afford to make an offering to Jehovah that is beyond the requirements of his Naziriteship, he must then carry out his vow out of regard for the law of his Naziriteship.'\"\n22 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 23 \"Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is the way you should bless the people of Israel. Say to them:\n24 \"May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you.\n25 May Jehovah make his face shine upon you, and may he favor you.\n26 May Jehovah lift up his face toward you and grant you peace.\"'\n27 And they must place my name upon the people of Israel, that I may bless them.\"\nChapter 7\n1 On the day that Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and sanctified it, together with all its furnishings, the altar, and all its utensils. When he had anointed and sanctified these things, 2 the chieftains of Israel, the heads of their paternal houses, made an offering. These chieftains of the tribes who presided over the registration 3 brought before Jehovah their offering of six covered wagons and 12 oxen, a wagon for two chieftains and a bull for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle. 4 Jehovah said to Moses: 5 \"Accept these things from them, as they will be used for the service of the tent of meeting, and you should give them to the Levites, to each one as needed for his duties.\"\n6 So Moses accepted the wagons and the cattle and gave them to the Levites. 7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to what was needed for their duties; 8 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to what was needed for their duties, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 9 But he did not give any to the sons of Kohath because their duties involved the service of the holy place, and they carried the holy things on their shoulders.\n10 Now the chieftains made their presentation at the inauguration of the altar on the day it was anointed. When the chieftains presented their offering before the altar, 11 Jehovah said to Moses: \"One chieftain each day, on successive days, will present his offering for the inauguration of the altar.\"\n12 The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab of the tribe of Judah. 13 His offering was one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 14 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 15 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 16 one young goat for a sin offering; 17 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab.\n18 On the second day, Nethanel the son of Zuar, the chieftain of Issachar, made a presentation. 19 He presented as his offering one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 20 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 21 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 22 one young goat for a sin offering; 23 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Nethanel the son of Zuar.\n24 On the third day, the chieftain for the sons of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon, 25 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 26 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 27 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 28 one young goat for a sin offering; 29 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Eliab the son of Helon.\n30 On the fourth day, the chieftain for the sons of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur, 31 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 32 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 33 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 34 one young goat for a sin offering; 35 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Elizur the son of Shedeur.\n36 On the fifth day, the chieftain for the sons of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai, 37 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 38 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 39 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 40 one young goat for a sin offering; 41 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\n42 On the sixth day, the chieftain for the sons of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel, 43 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 44 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 45 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 46 one young goat for a sin offering; 47 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Eliasaph the son of Deuel.\n48 On the seventh day, the chieftain for the sons of Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud, 49 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 50 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 51 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 52 one young goat for a sin offering; 53 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Elishama the son of Ammihud.\n54 On the eighth day, the chieftain for the sons of Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, 55 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 56 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 57 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 58 one young goat for a sin offering; 59 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.\n60 On the ninth day, the chieftain for the sons of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni, 61 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 62 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 63 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 64 one young goat for a sin offering; 65 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Abidan the son of Gideoni.\n66 On the tenth day, the chieftain for the sons of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai, 67 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 68 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 69 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 70 one young goat for a sin offering; 71 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.\n72 On the 11th day, the chieftain for the sons of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran, 73 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 74 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 75 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 76 one young goat for a sin offering; 77 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Pagiel the son of Ochran.\n78 On the 12th day, the chieftain for the sons of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan, 79 made his offering of one silver dish weighing 130 shekels and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; 80 one gold cup weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 81 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; 82 one young goat for a sin offering; 83 and for a communion sacrifice, two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old. This was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan.\n84 This was the inauguration offering of the altar from the chieftains of Israel when it was anointed: 12 silver dishes, 12 silver bowls, 12 gold cups; 85 each silver dish weighing 130 shekels and each bowl weighing 70 shekels, all the silver of the vessels amounting to 2,400 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place; 86 the 12 gold cups full of incense each weighed 10 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, all the gold of the cups amounting to 120 shekels. 87 All the cattle for the burnt offering were 12 bulls, 12 rams, 12 male lambs each a year old and their grain offerings, and 12 young goats for a sin offering; 88 and all the cattle of the communion sacrifice amounted to 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 male goats, and 60 male lambs each a year old. This was the inauguration offering of the altar after it was anointed.\n89 Whenever Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with God, he would hear the voice conversing with him from above the cover of the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubs; and God would speak to him.\nChapter 8\n1 Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying: 2 \"Speak to Aaron and tell him, 'When you light up the lamps, the seven lamps should shine on the area in front of the lampstand.'\" 3 So Aaron did this: He lit up its lamps for the area in front of the lampstand, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 4 This is how the lampstand was made: It was hammered work of gold; from its stem to its blossoms, it was hammered work. The lampstand was made according to the vision that Jehovah had shown Moses.\n5 Jehovah spoke again to Moses, saying: 6 \"Take the Levites from among the Israelites, and cleanse them. 7 This is how you should cleanse them: Sprinkle sin-cleansing water on them, and they must shave their whole body with a razor, wash their garments, and cleanse themselves. 8 Then they will take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you will take another young bull for a sin offering. 9 And you are to present the Levites before the tent of meeting and gather all the assembly of the Israelites. 10 When you present the Levites before Jehovah, the Israelites are to lay their hands on the Levites. 11 And Aaron must offer the Levites before Jehovah as a wave offering from the Israelites, and they will carry out the service of Jehovah.\n12 \"Then the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the bulls. After that, offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to Jehovah to make atonement for the Levites. 13 And you will have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and offer them as a wave offering to Jehovah. 14 You must separate the Levites from among the Israelites, and the Levites will become mine. 15 Afterward, the Levites will come in to serve at the tent of meeting. This is how you should cleanse them and offer them as a wave offering. 16 For they are given ones, given to me from among the Israelites. In place of all those who are firstborn of the Israelites, I will take them for myself. 17 For every firstborn among the Israelites is mine, both man and animal. I sanctified them to myself on the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt. 18 I will take the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites. 19 I will give the Levites as given ones to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to carry out the service in behalf of the Israelites at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the Israelites, so that no plague may occur among the Israelites because the people of Israel come near the holy place.\"\n20 Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the Israelites did this with the Levites. In accord with all that Jehovah had commanded Moses regarding the Levites, that is what the Israelites did with them. 21 So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments, after which Aaron offered them as a wave offering before Jehovah. Then Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. 22 Thereafter, the Levites went in to carry out their service at the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons. Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses respecting the Levites, so they did with them.\n23 Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying: 24 \"This applies to the Levites: From 25 years old and up, a man will join the company of those in the service of the tent of meeting. 25 But after the age of 50 years, he will retire from the service company and not serve any longer. 26 He may minister to his brothers who are taking care of the responsibilities at the tent of meeting, but he must not perform the service there. This is what you are to do regarding the Levites and their responsibilities.\"\nChapter 9\n1 Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: 2 \"The Israelites should prepare the Passover sacrifice at its appointed time. 3 On the 14th day of this month at twilight, you should prepare it at its appointed time. According to all its statutes and all its set procedures, you should prepare it.\"\n4 So Moses told the Israelites to prepare the Passover sacrifice. 5 Then they prepared the Passover sacrifice in the first month, on the 14th day of the month at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the Israelites did.\n6 Now there were men who had become unclean by touching a dead body, so that they were not able to prepare the Passover sacrifice on that day. So those men presented themselves before Moses and Aaron on that day 7 and said to him: \"We are unclean because of touching a dead body. Why should we be kept from presenting the offering to Jehovah at its appointed time among the Israelites?\" 8 At this Moses said to them: \"Wait there, and let me hear what Jehovah may command regarding you.\"\n9 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 10 \"Tell the Israelites, 'Although any man among you or of your future generations should become unclean by touching a dead body or should be off on a distant journey, he must still prepare the Passover sacrifice to Jehovah. 11 They should prepare it in the second month, on the 14th day at twilight. They should eat it together with unleavened bread and bitter greens. 12 They must not let any of it remain until morning, and they should not break any bone in it. They should prepare it according to every statute regarding the Passover. 13 But if a man was clean or was not off on a journey and neglected to prepare the Passover sacrifice, that person must then be cut off from his people, because he did not present the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time. That man will answer for his sin.\n14 \"'And if a foreign resident is residing with you, he should also prepare the Passover sacrifice to Jehovah. He should do so according to the statute of the Passover and its set procedure. There should exist one statute for you, both for the foreign resident and for the native of the land.'\"\n15 Now on the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony, but in the evening what appeared to be fire remained over the tabernacle until morning. 16 That is what continued to take place: The cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 17 Whenever the cloud lifted from the tent, the Israelites would promptly depart, and in the place where the cloud would remain, there is where the Israelites would encamp. 18 At the order of Jehovah the Israelites would depart, and at the order of Jehovah they would encamp. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle, they would remain encamped. 19 When the cloud would stay over the tabernacle for many days, the Israelites would obey Jehovah and not depart. 20 Sometimes the cloud would remain for a few days over the tabernacle. At the order of Jehovah they would remain encamped, and at the order of Jehovah they would depart. 21 Sometimes the cloud would remain only from evening until morning, and when the cloud lifted in the morning, they would depart. Whether it was day or night when the cloud lifted, they would depart. 22 Whether it was two days, a month, or longer, as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, the Israelites remained encamped and would not depart. But when it lifted, they would depart. 23 At the order of Jehovah they would encamp, and at the order of Jehovah they would depart. They kept their obligation to Jehovah at the order of Jehovah through Moses.\nChapter 10\n1 Jehovah then said to Moses: 2 \"Make two trumpets for yourself; make them of hammered silver, and use them to summon the assembly and to break up the camps. 3 When both of them are blown, the whole assembly must be summoned to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 4 If just one is blown, only the chieftains, the heads of the thousands of Israel, will be summoned to you.\n5 \"When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast, the camps of those to the east should depart. 6 When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast a second time, the camps of those to the south should depart. They should sound the trumpet blasts in this way each time one of them departs.\n7 \"Now when calling the congregation together, you should blow the trumpets, but not with fluctuating blasts. 8 Aaron's sons, the priests, should blow the trumpets, and the use of them will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations.\n9 \"If you should go to war in your land against an oppressor who is harassing you, you should sound a war call on the trumpets, and you will be remembered by Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies.\n10 \"Also, on your joyous occasions-your festivals and at the beginning of your months-you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices; they will serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am Jehovah your God.\"\n11 Now in the second year, in the second month, on the 20th day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the Testimony. 12 So the Israelites began to pull away from the wilderness of Sinai in the order established for their departure, and the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paran. 13 This was the first time they departed following the order of Jehovah through Moses.\n14 So the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Judah departed first by their companies, and Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over its company. 15 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 16 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.\n17 When the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who carried the tabernacle, departed.\n18 Then the three-tribe division of the camp of Reuben departed by their companies, and Elizur the son of Shedeur was over its company. 19 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 20 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.\n21 Then the Kohathites, who carried the sanctuary items, departed. The tabernacle was to be set up by the time they arrived.\n22 Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Ephraim departed by their companies, and Elishama the son of Ammihud was over its company. 23 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 24 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.\n25 Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Dan departed by their companies, forming the rear guard for all the camps, and Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over its company. 26 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. 27 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 28 This was the order of departure that the Israelites and their companies followed when they would depart.\n29 Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses: \"We are setting out for the place about which Jehovah said, 'I will give it to you.' Do come with us, and we will treat you well, because Jehovah has promised good things for Israel.\" 30 But he said to him: \"I will not go. I will return to my own country and to my relatives.\" 31 At this he said: \"Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our guide. 32 And if you do come with us, whatever goodness Jehovah shows to us, we will surely show to you.\"\n33 So they began marching from the mountain of Jehovah for a journey of three days, and the ark of Jehovah's covenant traveled before them for the three-day journey to search out a resting-place for them. 34 And Jehovah's cloud was over them by day when they set out from the encampment.\n35 Whenever the Ark was moved, Moses would say: \"Rise up, O Jehovah, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee from before you.\" 36 And when it would rest, he would say: \"Do return, O Jehovah, to the countless thousands of Israel.\"\nChapter 11\n1 Now the people began to complain bitterly before Jehovah. When Jehovah heard it, his anger flared, and a fire from Jehovah began to blaze against them and to consume some on the outskirts of the camp. 2 When the people began to cry out to Moses, he made supplication to Jehovah, and the fire died out. 3 So that place was given the name Taberah, because a fire from Jehovah had blazed against them.\n4 The mixed crowd who were in their midst then expressed selfish longing, and the Israelites too began to weep again and say: \"Who will give us meat to eat? 5 How fondly we remember the fish that we used to eat without cost in Egypt, also the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic! 6 But now we are withering away. We see nothing at all except this manna.\"\n7 Incidentally, the manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium gum. 8 The people would spread out and pick it up and grind it in hand mills or pound it in a mortar. Then they would boil it in cooking pots or make it into round loaves, and it tasted like an oiled sweet cake. 9 When the dew descended on the camp by night, the manna would also descend on it.\n10 Moses heard the people weeping, family after family, each man at the entrance of his tent. And Jehovah became very angry, and Moses was also very displeased. 11 Then Moses said to Jehovah: \"Why have you afflicted your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, so that you put the burden of all this people on me? 12 Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, so that you should tell me, 'Carry them in your bosom, just as an attendant carries the nursing child,' to the land that you swore to give to their forefathers? 13 From where will I get meat to give to all this people? For they keep weeping before me, saying, 'Give us meat to eat!' 14 I am not able to bear all this people by myself; it is too much for me. 15 If this is how you are going to treat me, please kill me right now. If I have found favor in your eyes, do not make me see any more calamity.\"\n16 Jehovah replied to Moses: \"Gather for me 70 men from the elders of Israel, men whom you recognize as elders and officials of the people, and take them to the tent of meeting, and have them stand there with you. 17 I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take away some of the spirit that is on you and place it on them, and they will help you in bearing the burden of the people so that you may not have to bear it alone. 18 You should say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for you will certainly eat meat, because you have wept in Jehovah's hearing and have said: \"Who will give us meat to eat? It was better for us in Egypt.\" Jehovah will certainly give you meat, and you will eat. 19 You will eat, not one day nor 2 days nor 5 days nor 10 days nor 20 days, 20 but for a whole month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and it has become loathsome to you, for you rejected Jehovah, who is in your midst, and you were weeping before him, saying: \"Why is it that we have come out of Egypt?\"'\"\n21 Then Moses said: \"The people I am among number 600,000 men on foot, and yet you yourself have said, 'Meat I will give them, and they will eat enough for a whole month of days'! 22 If whole flocks and herds were slaughtered, would it be enough for them? Or if all the fish of the sea were caught, would it be enough for them?\"\n23 Jehovah then said to Moses: \"Is the hand of Jehovah too short? Now you will see whether what I say will happen to you or not.\"\n24 So Moses went out and spoke the words of Jehovah to the people. And he gathered 70 men from the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent. 25 Then Jehovah came down in a cloud and spoke to him and took away some of the spirit that was on him and put it on each of the 70 elders. And as soon as the spirit settled down on them, they began to behave as prophets, but they did not do it again.\n26 There were two of the men still in the camp. Their names were Eldad and Medad. And the spirit began to settle down on them, as they were among those whose names had been written down, but they had not gone out to the tent. So they began to behave as prophets in the camp. 27 And a young man ran and reported to Moses: \"Eldad and Medad are behaving as prophets in the camp!\" 28 Then Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth, responded and said: \"My lord Moses, restrain them!\" 29 But Moses said to him: \"Are you jealous for me? No, I wish that all of Jehovah's people were prophets and that Jehovah would put his spirit on them!\" 30 Later Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.\n31 Then a wind from Jehovah sprang up and began driving quail from the sea and causing them to fall around the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and they were about two cubits deep on the ground. 32 So all that day and all night and all the next day, the people stayed up and gathered the quail. No one gathered less than ten homers, and they kept spreading them all around the camp for themselves. 33 But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it could be chewed, Jehovah's anger blazed against the people, and Jehovah began striking the people with a very great slaughter.\n34 So they gave that place the name Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who showed selfish craving. 35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the people departed for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.\nChapter 12\n1 Now Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushite wife he had married, for he had taken a Cushite wife. 2 They were saying: \"Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken? Has he not also spoken through us?\" And Jehovah was listening. 3 Now the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men on the face of the earth.\n4 Jehovah suddenly said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam: \"Go out, the three of you, to the tent of meeting.\" So the three of them went out. 5 And Jehovah came down in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam. Both of them went forward. 6 He then said: \"Hear my words, please. If there was a prophet of Jehovah among you, I would make myself known to him in a vision, and I would speak to him in a dream. 7 But it is not that way with my servant Moses! He is being entrusted with all my house. 8 Face-to-face I speak to him, openly, not by riddles; and the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees. Why, then, did you not fear to speak against my servant, against Moses?\"\n9 So Jehovah's anger burned against them, and he departed from them. 10 The cloud moved away from over the tent, and look! Miriam was struck with leprosy as white as snow. Then Aaron turned toward Miriam, and he saw that she was struck with leprosy. 11 Immediately Aaron said to Moses: \"I beg you, my lord! Please do not hold this sin against us! We have acted foolishly in what we have done. 12 Please, do not let her continue like someone dead, whose flesh is half eaten away at birth!\" 13 And Moses began to cry out to Jehovah, saying: \"O God, please heal her! Please!\"\n14 Jehovah replied to Moses: \"If her father would spit directly in her face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? Let her be quarantined for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be brought back in.\" 15 So Miriam was quarantined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not break camp until Miriam was brought back in. 16 Then the people departed from Hazeroth and began camping in the wilderness of Paran.\nChapter 13\n1 Jehovah now spoke to Moses, saying: 2 \"Send out men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. You are to send out one man from each ancestral tribe, each one a chieftain among them.\"\n3 So Moses sent them out from the wilderness of Paran at the order of Jehovah. All the men were heads of the Israelites. 4 These are their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; 5 of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; 6 of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 7 of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; 8 of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; 9 of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; 10 of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; 11 of the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; 12 of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; 13 of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; 14 of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; 15 of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses gave the name Joshua to Hoshea the son of Nun.\n17 When Moses was sending them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them: \"Go up there into the Negeb, and then go up into the mountainous region. 18 You must see what kind of land it is and whether the people who are dwelling in it are strong or weak, few or many, 19 and whether the land is good or bad and whether the cities they are dwelling in are encampments or fortifications. 20 And find out whether the land is rich or poor and whether there are trees in it or not. You must be courageous and take some of the fruitage of the land.\" Now it was the season of the first ripe grapes.\n21 So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near Lebo-hamath. 22 When they went up into the Negeb, they came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the Anakim, were living. Incidentally, Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan of Egypt. 23 When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes, which two of the men had to carry on a bar, as well as some of the pomegranates and figs. 24 They called that place the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster that the Israelites cut down from there.\n25 At the end of 40 days, they returned from spying out the land. 26 So they came back to Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the Israelites in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They brought back a report to all the assembly and showed them the fruitage of the land. 27 This is what they reported to Moses: \"We entered the land into which you sent us, and it is indeed flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruitage. 28 Nevertheless, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the fortified cities are very great. We also saw the Anakim there. 29 The Amalekites are dwelling in the land of the Negeb, and the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites are dwelling in the mountainous region, and the Canaanites are dwelling by the sea and along the Jordan.\"\n30 Then Caleb tried to calm the people as they stood before Moses by saying: \"Let us go up immediately, and we are sure to take possession of it, because we can surely conquer it.\" 31 But the men who went up with him said: \"We are not able to go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are.\" 32 And they kept on giving the Israelites a bad report about the land that they had spied out, saying: \"The land that we passed through to spy out is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of extraordinary size. 33 And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who are from the Nephilim, and in comparison we seemed like grasshoppers, both to us and to them.\"\nChapter 14\n1 Then all the assembly raised their voice, and the people continued crying out and weeping all through that night. 2 All the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly spoke against them, saying: \"If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness! 3 Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?\" 4 They were even saying to one another: \"Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt!\"\n5 At this Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground before the whole assembled congregation of the Israelites. 6 Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who spied out the land, ripped their garments apart, 7 and they said this to all the assembly of the Israelites: \"The land that we passed through to spy out is a very, very good land. 8 If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey. 9 But you must not rebel against Jehovah, and you must not fear the people of the land, for we will devour them. Their protection has been removed from them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.\"\n10 However, all the assembly talked of stoning them. But Jehovah's glory appeared on the tent of meeting to all the people of Israel.\n11 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"How much longer will this people treat me without respect, and how much longer will they not put faith in me in spite of all the signs that I performed among them? 12 Let me strike them with pestilence and drive them away, and let me make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.\"\n13 But Moses said to Jehovah: \"Then the Egyptians, from whose midst you brought this people out by your power, will hear, 14 and they will speak about it to the inhabitants of this land. These also have heard that you, Jehovah, are among this people and have appeared to them face-to-face. You are Jehovah, and your cloud is standing over them, and you are going before them in the pillar of cloud by day and in the pillar of fire by night. 15 If you put this people to death all at once, the nations who have heard of your fame would say this: 16 'Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.' 17 Please, now, Jehovah, let your power be great, as you promised when you said: 18 'Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love, pardoning error and transgression, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation.' 19 Forgive, please, the error of this people according to your great loyal love, just as you have pardoned this people from Egypt until now.\"\n20 Then Jehovah said: \"I forgive them according to your word. 21 But on the other hand, as surely as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah. 22 However, not one of the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness and yet have kept testing me these ten times and have not listened to my voice 23 will ever see the land about which I swore to their fathers. No, not one of those treating me without respect will see it. 24 But because my servant Caleb had a different spirit and kept following after me wholeheartedly, I will certainly bring him into the land where he went, and his offspring will take possession of it. 25 Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are dwelling in the valley, you should turn back tomorrow and set off for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.\"\n26 Jehovah then said to Moses and Aaron: 27 \"How much longer will this evil assembly keep up this murmuring against me? I have heard what the Israelites are murmuring against me. 28 Say to them, '\"As surely as I live,\" declares Jehovah, \"I will do to you just what I have heard you speak! 29 In this wilderness your corpses will fall, yes, the whole number of you from 20 years old and up who were registered, all of you who have murmured against me. 30 None of you will enter into the land that I swore to have you reside in except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.\n31 \"'\"And I will bring in your children, who you said would become plunder, and they will get to know the land that you have rejected. 32 But your own corpses will fall in this wilderness. 33 Now your sons will become shepherds in the wilderness 40 years, and they will have to answer for your acts of unfaithfulness until the last one of your corpses falls in the wilderness. 34 According to the number of the days that you spied out the land, 40 days, a day for a year, a day for a year, you will answer for your errors 40 years, for you will know what it means to oppose me.\n35 \"'\"I, Jehovah, have spoken. This is what I will do to all this evil assembly, those who have gathered together against me: In this wilderness they will come to their end, and here they will die. 36 The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who caused the whole assembly to murmur against him when they returned with a bad report about the land, 37 yes, the men who brought back the bad report about the land will be struck down and die before Jehovah. 38 But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who went to spy out the land, will certainly keep living.\"'\"\n39 When Moses spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people began to mourn a great deal. 40 Moreover, they got up early in the morning and tried to go up to the top of the mountain, saying: \"Here we are ready to go up to the place that Jehovah spoke about, for we have sinned.\" 41 But Moses said: \"Why are you going beyond the order of Jehovah? This will not succeed. 42 Do not go up, for Jehovah is not with you; and you will be defeated by your enemies. 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there to face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you turned away from following Jehovah, Jehovah will not be with you.\"\n44 However, they presumptuously went toward the top of the mountain, but the ark of Jehovah's covenant and Moses did not move away from the middle of the camp. 45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who were dwelling in that mountain came down and struck them, scattering them as far as Hormah.\nChapter 15\n1 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and say to them, 'When you eventually come into the land that I am giving you to dwell in 3 and you make an offering by fire to Jehovah from the herd or from the flock-whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or a voluntary offering or an offering during your seasonal festivals, in order to make a pleasing aroma to Jehovah- 4 the one presenting his offering must also present to Jehovah a grain offering of fine flour, a tenth of an ephah, mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil. 5 You should also offer wine as a drink offering, a fourth of a hin, together with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice of each male lamb. 6 Or for a ram, you should make a grain offering of two tenths of an ephah measure of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil. 7 And you should present wine as a drink offering, a third of a hin, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\n8 \"'But if you should offer a male of the herd as a burnt offering or a sacrifice to perform a special vow or communion sacrifices to Jehovah, 9 you should also present together with the male of the herd a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah measure of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 10 You should also present wine as a drink offering, half a hin, as an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 11 This is what should be done for each bull or for each ram or for each of the male lambs or of the goats. 12 Whatever may be the number that you offer, that is what you should do for each one, according to their number. 13 This is how every native-born Israelite should present an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\n14 \"'If a foreigner who is residing with you or one who has been in your midst for many of your generations should also make an offering by fire, as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah, he should do just as you do. 15 You who are of the congregation and the foreigner who is residing with you will have one statute. It will be a lasting statute for all your generations. The foreign resident should be the same as you before Jehovah. 16 There should be one law and one judicial decision for you and for the foreigner who is residing with you.'\"\n17 Jehovah went on to say to Moses: 18 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'When you come into the land where I am bringing you 19 and you eat any of the bread of the land, you should make a contribution to Jehovah. 20 You should make a contribution of the firstfruits of your coarse meal as ring-shaped loaves. Like the contribution of a threshing floor is the way you should contribute it. 21 Some of the firstfruits of your coarse meal you should give as a contribution to Jehovah throughout your generations.\n22 \"'Now if you make a mistake and fail to observe all these commandments that Jehovah has spoken to Moses, 23 all that Jehovah has commanded you through Moses from the day that Jehovah commanded and onward for your generations, 24 and if it was done by mistake and without the knowledge of the assembly, the whole assembly must offer one young bull as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to Jehovah, together with its grain offering and its drink offering according to the regular procedure, and one young goat as a sin offering. 25 The priest will make atonement for the whole assembly of the Israelites, and it will be forgiven them, because it was a mistake, and they brought as their offering an offering made by fire to Jehovah and their sin offering before Jehovah for their mistake. 26 It will be forgiven the whole assembly of the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst, because it was by mistake on the part of all the people.\n27 \"'If any person should sin by mistake, then he must present a female goat in its first year for a sin offering. 28 And the priest will make atonement for the person who made a mistake by an unintentional sin before Jehovah, so as to make atonement for it, and it will be forgiven him. 29 As for the native-born among the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst, there should be one law for you in the matter of doing something unintentionally.\n30 \"'But the person who does something deliberately, whether he is native-born or a foreign resident, is blaspheming Jehovah and must be cut off from among his people. 31 Because he has despised Jehovah's word and broken his commandment, that person should be cut off without fail. His own error is upon him.'\"\n32 While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man collecting pieces of wood on the Sabbath day. 33 Those who found him collecting wood brought him up to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly. 34 They committed him into custody because it had not been specified what should be done to him.\n35 And Jehovah said to Moses: \"The man should be put to death without fail, and the whole assembly should stone him outside the camp.\" 36 So the whole assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him so that he died, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n37 Jehovah went on to say this to Moses: 38 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them that they must make for themselves fringed edges on the skirts of their garments throughout their generations, and they are to put a blue string above the fringed edge of the skirt. 39 'You must have this fringed edge so that you will see it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and observe them. You must not follow your own hearts and eyes, which are leading you to spiritual prostitution. 40 This will help you remember, and you will observe all my commandments and be holy to your God. 41 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt in order to prove myself your God. I am Jehovah your God.'\"\nChapter 16\n1 Then Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, got up together with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, of the sons of Reuben. 2 They rose up against Moses along with 250 Israelite men, chieftains of the assembly, chosen ones of the congregation, prominent men. 3 So they gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them: \"We have had enough of you! The whole assembly is holy, all of them, and Jehovah is in their midst. Why, then, should you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?\"\n4 When Moses heard this, he at once fell facedown. 5 Then he said to Korah and to all his supporters: \"In the morning Jehovah will make known who belongs to him and who is holy and who should approach him, and whomever he may choose will approach him. 6 Do this: Take fire holders, Korah and all your supporters, 7 and put fire in them and place incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow, and the man whom Jehovah will choose, he is the holy one. You sons of Levi have gone far enough!\"\n8 Moses then said to Korah: \"Listen, please, you sons of Levi. 9 Does it seem to you such a little thing that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel and allowed you to approach him in order to perform the service of Jehovah's tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them, 10 and that he brought you near to him along with all your brothers, the sons of Levi? Must you also try to secure the priesthood? 11 For this reason, you and all your supporters who are gathering together are against Jehovah. As for Aaron, who is he that you should murmur against him?\"\n12 Moses later sent for Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said: \"We are not going to come! 13 Is it so little a thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the wilderness? Now do you also want to make yourself an absolute ruler over us? 14 As it is, you have not brought us into any land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of field and vineyard. Would you bore out the eyes of those men? We are not going to come!\"\n15 So Moses became very angry and said to Jehovah: \"Do not turn to look at their grain offering. Not one donkey have I taken away from them, nor have I harmed one of them.\"\n16 Then Moses said to Korah: \"Present yourself with all your supporters before Jehovah tomorrow, you and they and Aaron. 17 Each one should take his fire holder and put incense on it, and each will present his fire holder before Jehovah, 250 fire holders, together with you and Aaron, each with his fire holder.\" 18 So each of them took his fire holder, and they put fire and incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting together with Moses and Aaron. 19 When Korah had gathered his supporters against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting, Jehovah's glory appeared to all the assembly.\n20 Jehovah now told Moses and Aaron: 21 \"Separate yourselves from among this group, so that I may exterminate them in an instant.\" 22 At this, they fell with their faces to the ground and said: \"O God, the God of the spirit of all people, will one man's sin cause you to become indignant against the entire assembly?\"\n23 Jehovah then said to Moses: 24 \"Speak to the assembly and tell them, 'Get away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!'\"\n25 Then Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel went with him. 26 He told the assembly: \"Move away, please, from the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, so that you may not be swept away in all their sin.\" 27 They immediately moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, from every side, and Dathan and Abiram came out, taking their stand at the entrance of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little children.\n28 Then Moses said: \"By this you will know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these things, that it is not of my own heart: 29 If these people die a natural death as all men do and if their punishment is the same as that of all mankind, then Jehovah has not sent me. 30 But if Jehovah does something extraordinary with them and the ground opens and swallows them and everything that belongs to them and they go down alive into the Grave, you will certainly know that these men have treated Jehovah disrespectfully.\"\n31 As soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground beneath them split apart. 32 And the earth opened and swallowed them up, along with their households and everyone who belonged to Korah and all their goods. 33 So they and all who belonged to them went down alive into the Grave, and the earth covered them over, so that they perished from the midst of the congregation. 34 All the Israelites who were around them fled at their screaming, for they said: \"We are afraid that the earth may swallow us up!\" 35 Then a fire came out from Jehovah and consumed the 250 men offering the incense.\n36 Jehovah now said to Moses: 37 \"Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take the fire holders out of the fire, for they are holy. Also tell him to scatter the fire some distance away. 38 The fire holders of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives should be made into thin metal plates to overlay the altar, because they presented them before Jehovah, and they became holy. They should serve as a sign to the Israelites.\" 39 So Eleazar the priest took the copper fire holders that had been presented by those who were burned up, and beat them to overlay the altar, 40 just as Jehovah had told him through Moses. It was a reminder for the Israelites that no unauthorized person who is not of the offspring of Aaron should approach to burn incense before Jehovah and that no one should become like Korah and his supporters.\n41 On the very next day, the whole assembly of the Israelites began to murmur against Moses and Aaron, saying: \"You two have put Jehovah's people to death.\" 42 When the assembly had gathered together against Moses and Aaron, they then turned toward the tent of meeting, and look! the cloud covered it, and Jehovah's glory began to appear.\n43 Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting, 44 and Jehovah said to Moses: 45 \"You men, remove yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may exterminate them in an instant.\" At this they fell with their faces to the ground. 46 Moses then said to Aaron: \"Take the fire holder and put fire from the altar in it and put incense on it and go quickly to the assembly and make atonement for them, because indignation has gone out from Jehovah. The plague has started!\" 47 Aaron at once took it, just as Moses had said, and ran into the midst of the congregation, and look! the plague had started among the people. So he put the incense on the fire holder and began making atonement for the people. 48 He kept standing between the dead and the living, and the scourge eventually stopped. 49 Those who died from the scourge amounted to 14,700, besides those dead on account of Korah. 50 When at last Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, the scourge had been stopped.\nChapter 17\n1 Jehovah now said to Moses: 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and take from them one rod for each paternal house, from the chieftains of each paternal house, 12 rods in all. Write the name of each one on his rod. 3 You should write Aaron's name on Levi's rod, because there is one rod for the head of each paternal house. 4 Deposit the rods in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I regularly present myself to you. 5 And the rod of the man whom I choose will bud, and I will put a stop to the murmuring of the Israelites against me, which they are also murmuring against you.\"\n6 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and all their chieftains gave him rods-a rod for each chieftain of a paternal house, 12 rods-and Aaron's rod was among their rods. 7 Then Moses deposited the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the Testimony.\n8 On the next day, when Moses went into the tent of the Testimony, look! Aaron's rod for the house of Levi had budded and was bringing forth buds and blossoming flowers and bearing ripe almonds. 9 Moses then brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the people of Israel. They looked at them, and each man took his own rod.\n10 Jehovah then said to Moses: \"Put Aaron's rod back before the Testimony as something to be kept for a sign to the sons of rebelliousness, so that their murmurings against me may cease and so that they may not die.\" 11 Moses immediately did just as Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.\n12 The Israelites then said to Moses: \"Now we will die, we will surely perish, we are all going to perish! 13 Anyone who even comes close to Jehovah's tabernacle will die! Must we end up dying that way?\"\nChapter 18\n1 Jehovah then said to Aaron: \"You and your sons and your paternal house with you will be answerable for any error against the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will be answerable for any error against your priesthood. 2 Also bring near your brothers of the tribe of Levi, your ancestral tribe, so that they may join you and minister to you and your sons before the tent of the Testimony. 3 They are to fulfill their responsibilities to you and to the entire tent. However, they must not come near the utensils of the holy place and the altar, so that neither they nor you may die. 4 They will join you and carry out their responsibilities regarding the tent of meeting and all the service of the tent, and no unauthorized person may come near to you. 5 You must carry out your responsibility toward the holy place and the altar, so that no further indignation may come against the people of Israel. 6 I myself have taken your brothers, the Levites, from among the Israelites as a gift for you. They are given to Jehovah to care for the service of the tent of meeting. 7 You and your sons are responsible for your priestly duties pertaining to the altar and what is inside the curtain, and you are to render this service. I have given the service of the priesthood as a gift to you, and any unauthorized person who approaches should be put to death.\"\n8 Jehovah spoke further to Aaron: \"I myself put you in charge of the contributions made to me. I have given to you and to your sons a portion of all the holy things contributed by the Israelites as a permanent allowance. 9 This will be yours out of the most holy offerings made by fire: every offering they make, including their grain offerings and their sin offerings and their guilt offerings that they bring to me. It is something most holy for you and for your sons. 10 In a most holy place you should eat it. Every male may eat it. It will be something holy to you. 11 This also belongs to you: the gifts they contribute together with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you and your sons and your daughters with you as a permanent allowance. Everyone clean in your house may eat it.\n12 \"All the best of the oil and all the best of the new wine and the grain, their firstfruits, which they give to Jehovah, I give them to you. 13 The first ripe fruits of everything from their land, which they will bring to Jehovah, will become yours. Everyone clean in your house may eat it.\n14 \"Every devoted thing in Israel should become yours.\n15 \"Every firstborn of all living things, which they will present to Jehovah, whether man or animal, should become yours. However, you should without fail redeem the firstborn of mankind, and the firstborn of the unclean animals you should redeem. 16 You should redeem it with the redemption price when it is a month old and up, by the estimated value of five silver shekels, according to the standard shekel of the holy place. It is 20 gerahs. 17 Only the firstborn bull or firstborn male lamb or firstborn goat you should not redeem. They are something holy. You should sprinkle their blood on the altar, and their fat you should make smoke as an offering made by fire for a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. 18 And their flesh should become yours. Like the breast of the wave offering and like the right leg, it should become yours. 19 All the holy contributions that the Israelites will contribute to Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you as a permanent allowance. It is a lasting covenant of salt before Jehovah for you and your offspring with you.\"\n20 Jehovah went on to say to Aaron: \"In their land you will not have an inheritance, and no portion of land among them will become yours. I am your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the Israelites.\n21 \"Now see that I have given to the sons of Levi every tenth part in Israel as an inheritance in return for the service they are carrying out, the service of the tent of meeting. 22 No longer may the people of Israel approach the tent of meeting, or else they will incur sin and die. 23 The Levites themselves are to carry out the service of the tent of meeting, and they are the ones who will answer for their error. It is a lasting statute during all your generations that they should not take possession of an inheritance among the Israelites. 24 For I have given to the Levites as an inheritance the tenth part contributed by the people of Israel, which they will contribute to Jehovah. That is why I have said to them, 'In the midst of the Israelites, they should not take possession of an inheritance.'\"\n25 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 26 \"You should tell the Levites, 'You will receive from the Israelites the tenth part that I have given to you from them for your inheritance, and you should contribute from it a tenth part of the tenth part as a contribution to Jehovah. 27 And it will be considered your contribution, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor or the full production of the winepress or oil press. 28 In this way you will also give a contribution to Jehovah from all the tenth parts that you receive from the Israelites, and from them you are to give the contribution for Jehovah to Aaron the priest. 29 You will make every sort of contribution to Jehovah from the very best of all the gifts given to you as something holy.'\n30 \"And you must say to them, 'When you contribute the best of them, then it will be considered for the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress or oil press. 31 You and your household may eat it in any place, because it is your wages in return for your service at the tent of meeting. 32 You will not incur sin in this as long as you contribute the best from them, and you must not profane the holy things of the Israelites, or you will die.'\"\nChapter 19\n1 Jehovah spoke again to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 \"This is a statute of the law that Jehovah has commanded, 'Tell the Israelites that they should take for you a sound red cow in which there is no defect and upon which no yoke has come. 3 You are to give it to Eleazar the priest, and he will lead it outside the camp, and it will be slaughtered before him. 4 Then Eleazar the priest will take some of its blood with his finger and spatter its blood seven times straight toward the front of the tent of meeting. 5 The cow will then be burned before his eyes. Its skin and its flesh and its blood together with its dung will be burned. 6 And the priest will take cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet material and throw them into the fire where the cow is being burned. 7 The priest will then wash his garments and bathe himself in water, and afterward he may come into the camp; but the priest will be unclean until the evening.\n8 \"'The one who burned the cow will wash his garments in water and bathe himself in water, and he will be unclean until the evening.\n9 \"'A clean man will gather up the ashes of the cow and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and they should be kept by the assembly of the Israelites to prepare water that will be used for cleansing. It is a sin offering. 10 The one gathering the ashes of the cow will wash his garments and be unclean until the evening.\n\"'This will serve the Israelites and the foreigner who is residing in their midst as a lasting statute. 11 Anyone touching any dead person will be unclean for seven days. 12 Such one should purify himself with the water on the third day, and on the seventh day he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day, on the seventh day he will not be clean. 13 Everyone who touches the corpse of any dead person and does not purify himself has defiled Jehovah's tabernacle, and that person must be cut off from Israel. Because the water for cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he continues unclean. His uncleanness remains upon him.\n14 \"'This is the law that applies when a man dies in a tent: Everyone who enters the tent and everyone who was already in the tent will be unclean for seven days. 15 Every opened container with no lid tied on it is unclean. 16 Everyone in the open field who touches someone killed with the sword or a corpse or the bone of a man or a burial place will be unclean for seven days. 17 They should take for the unclean one some of the ashes of the sin offering that was burned and pour running water on them in a container. 18 Then a clean man will take hyssop and dip it into the water and spatter it on the tent and on all the containers and on the people who were there and on the one who touched the bone or the slain one or the corpse or the burial place. 19 The clean person will spatter it on the unclean one on the third day and on the seventh day, and he will purify him from sin on the seventh day; then he should wash his garments and bathe in water, and he will become clean in the evening.\n20 \"'But the man who is unclean and who will not purify himself, that person must be cut off from the congregation, because he has defiled Jehovah's sanctuary. The water for cleansing was not sprinkled on him, so he is unclean.\n21 \"'This will serve as a lasting statute for them: The one spattering the water for cleansing should wash his garments, and the one touching the water for cleansing will be unclean until the evening. 22 Anything the unclean one touches will be unclean, and the person who touches it will be unclean until the evening.'\"\nChapter 20\n1 In the first month, the entire assembly of the Israelites came into the wilderness of Zin, and the people began dwelling in Kadesh. It was there that Miriam died and was buried.\n2 Now there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered together against Moses and Aaron. 3 The people were quarreling with Moses, saying: \"If only we had died when our brothers died before Jehovah! 4 Why have you brought Jehovah's congregation into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here? 5 And why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place? It is no place for seed and figs and vines and pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.\" 6 Then Moses and Aaron came from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell with their faces to the ground, and Jehovah's glory began to appear to them.\n7 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 8 \"Take the rod and call the assembly together, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the crag before their eyes that it may give its water, and you will bring out water for them from the crag and give the assembly and their livestock something to drink.\"\n9 So Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, just as He had commanded him. 10 Then Moses and Aaron called the congregation together before the crag, and he said to them: \"Hear, now, you rebels! Must we bring out water for you from this crag?\" 11 With that Moses lifted his hand up and struck the crag twice with his rod, and much water began to pour out, and the assembly and their livestock began to drink.\n12 Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron: \"Because you did not show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of Israel, you will not bring this congregation into the land that I will give them.\" 13 These are the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah, so that he was sanctified among them.\n14 Then Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: \"This is what your brother Israel says, 'You well know all the hardship that we have experienced. 15 Our fathers went to Egypt, and we dwelled in Egypt many years, and the Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers. 16 Finally we cried out to Jehovah, and he heard us and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt, and here we are in Kadesh, a city on the border of your territory. 17 Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through any field or vineyard, and we will not drink the water of any well. We will march on the King's Road without turning to the right or the left until we pass through your territory.'\"\n18 However, Edom said to him: \"You may not pass through our territory. If you do, I will come out with the sword to meet you.\" 19 In turn the Israelites said to him: \"By the highway we will go up, and if we and our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We want nothing more than to pass through on foot.\" 20 Still he said: \"You may not pass through.\" With that Edom came out to encounter him with many people and a strong army. 21 So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; therefore, Israel turned away from him.\n22 The people of Israel, the entire assembly, departed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. 23 Then Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom: 24 \"Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land that I will give to the Israelites, because you both rebelled against my order regarding the waters of Meribah. 25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up into Mount Hor. 26 Remove Aaron's garments and clothe Eleazar his son with them, and Aaron will die there.\"\n27 So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor before the eyes of all the assembly. 28 Then Moses removed Aaron's garments and clothed Eleazar his son with them. After that Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 29 When all the assembly saw that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel wept for Aaron for 30 days.\nChapter 21\n1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who dwelled in the Negeb, heard that Israel had come by the way of Atharim, he attacked Israel and carried away some of them as captives. 2 So Israel made this vow to Jehovah: \"If you give this people into my hand, I will without fail devote their cities to destruction.\" 3 So Jehovah listened to Israel's voice and gave the Canaanites over to them, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. Therefore, they named the place Hormah.\n4 As they continued their journey from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea in order to go around the land of Edom, the people became weary of the journey. 5 And the people kept speaking against God and Moses, saying: \"Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no food and no water, and we have come to hate this contemptible bread.\" 6 So Jehovah sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they kept biting the people, so that many Israelites died.\n7 So the people came to Moses and said: \"We have sinned by speaking against Jehovah and against you. Intercede with Jehovah so that he may remove the serpents from us.\" And Moses interceded on behalf of the people. 8 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Make a replica of a poisonous snake and put it on a pole. Then when anyone has been bitten, he will have to look at it in order to keep alive.\" 9 Moses at once made a serpent of copper and put it on the pole, and whenever a serpent had bitten a man and he looked at the copper serpent, he survived.\n10 After that the Israelites departed and camped in Oboth. 11 Then they departed from Oboth and camped in Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab, toward the east. 12 From there they departed and camped by the Valley of Zered. 13 From there they departed and camped in the region of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 14 That is why the book of the Wars of Jehovah speaks of \"Vaheb in Suphah and the valleys of Arnon, 15 and the descent of the valleys, which extends toward the settlement of Ar and adjoins the border of Moab.\"\n16 Next they went on to Beer. This is the well about which Jehovah said to Moses: \"Gather the people, and let me give them water.\"\n17 At that time, Israel sang this song:\n\"Spring up, O well!-Respond to it!\n18 The well that princes dug, that nobles of the people excavated,\nWith a commander's staff and with their own staffs.\"\nThen they went from the wilderness on to Mattanah, 19 from Mattanah on to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel on to Bamoth. 20 They went from Bamoth on to the valley that is in the territory of Moab, on top of Pisgah, which overlooks Jeshimon.\n21 Israel now sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, saying: 22 \"Let us pass through your land. We will not turn aside into a field or a vineyard. We will not drink water from any well. We will march on the King's Road until we pass through your territory.\" 23 But Sihon did not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon gathered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness and came to Jahaz and began fighting with Israel. 24 But Israel defeated him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, near the Ammonites, because Jazer borders the territory of the Ammonites.\n25 So Israel took all these cities, and they began dwelling in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and all its dependent towns. 26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who had fought with the king of Moab and taken all his land from him as far as the Arnon. 27 That is what gave rise to the taunting proverbial saying:\n\"Come to Heshbon.\nLet the city of Sihon be built and firmly established.\n28 For a fire came out of Heshbon, a flame from the town of Sihon.\nIt has consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of the Arnon.\n29 Woe to you, Moab! You will be destroyed, O people of Chemosh!\nHe makes his sons fugitives and his daughters captives of Sihon, the king of the Amorites.\n30 Let us shoot at them;\nHeshbon will be destroyed as far as Dibon;\nLet us desolate it as far as Nophah;\nFire will spread as far as Medeba.\"\n31 So Israel began to dwell in the land of the Amorites. 32 Moses then sent some men to spy on Jazer. They captured its dependent towns and drove out the Amorites who were there. 33 After that they turned and went up by the Way of Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out with all his people to meet them in battle at Edrei. 34 Jehovah said to Moses: \"Do not be afraid of him, for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand, and you will do to him just as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.\" 35 So they kept striking him down, along with his sons and all his people, until none of his people survived, and they took possession of his land.\nChapter 22\n1 Then the Israelites departed and camped on the desert plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho. 2 Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 3 and Moab became very frightened of the people, because they were so many; indeed, Moab felt sick with fear because of the Israelites. 4 So Moab said to the elders of Midian: \"Now this congregation will devour all our surroundings, just as a bull devours the grass in the field.\"\nBalak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. 5 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the River in his native land. He summoned him, saying: \"Look! A people has come out of Egypt. Look! They have covered the face of the earth, and they are dwelling right in front of me. 6 Now, please, come and curse this people for me, for they are mightier than I am. Perhaps I can defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I well know that the one whom you bless is blessed and the one whom you curse is cursed.\"\n7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian traveled with the fee for divination in their hands and went to Balaam and conveyed to him Balak's message. 8 At that he said to them: \"Spend the night here, and I will bring back to you whatever word Jehovah speaks to me.\" So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.\n9 Then God came to Balaam and said: \"Who are these men with you?\" 10 Balaam said to the true God: \"Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, has sent me a message, saying, 11 'Look! The people who are coming out of Egypt are covering the face of the earth. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.'\" 12 But God said to Balaam: \"You must not go with them. You must not curse the people, for they are blessed.\"\n13 Balaam got up in the morning and said to the princes of Balak: \"Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.\" 14 So the princes of Moab departed and returned to Balak and said: \"Balaam has refused to come with us.\"\n15 However, Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first group. 16 They came to Balaam and said to him: \"This is what Balak the son of Zippor has said, 'Please do not let anything hinder you from coming to me, 17 for I will honor you greatly and I will do anything you tell me to do. So come, please, and curse this people for me.'\" 18 But Balaam answered the servants of Balak: \"If Balak were to give me his own house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything beyond the order of Jehovah my God, whether small or great. 19 But please stay here tonight also, so that I may learn what else Jehovah will tell me.\"\n20 Then God came to Balaam by night and said to him: \"If these men have come to summon you, go along with them. But you may speak only the words that I tell you to say.\" 21 So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.\n22 But God's anger blazed because he was going, and Jehovah's angel stationed himself in the road to resist him. Now Balaam was riding on his donkey, and two of his attendants were with him. 23 And when the donkey saw Jehovah's angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it tried to turn off the road into the field. But Balaam began to beat the donkey to make it return to the road. 24 Then Jehovah's angel stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with stone walls on both sides. 25 When the donkey saw Jehovah's angel, it began to squeeze itself against the wall and it jammed Balaam's foot against the wall, and Balaam began beating it again.\n26 Jehovah's angel now passed by again and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left. 27 When the donkey saw Jehovah's angel, it lay down under Balaam, so Balaam became furious and kept beating the donkey with his staff. 28 Finally Jehovah caused the donkey to speak, and it said to Balaam: \"What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?\" 29 Balaam replied to the donkey: \"It is because you have made a fool of me. If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you!\" 30 Then the donkey said to Balaam: \"Am I not your donkey that you have ridden on all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?\" He replied: \"No!\" 31 Then Jehovah uncovered Balaam's eyes, and he saw Jehovah's angel standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. At once he bowed low and prostrated himself on his face.\n32 Then Jehovah's angel said to him: \"Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Look! I myself came out to offer resistance, because your way is in defiance of my will. 33 The donkey saw me and tried to turn away from me these three times. Supposing it had not turned away from me! By now I would have killed you and let the donkey live.\" 34 Balaam said to Jehovah's angel: \"I have sinned, because I did not know that it was you standing in the road to meet me. And now if it is bad in your eyes, I will go back.\" 35 But Jehovah's angel said to Balaam: \"Go with the men, but you may speak only the words that I tell you.\" So Balaam continued going with the princes of Balak.\n36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he immediately went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the bank of the Arnon on the border of the territory. 37 Balak said to Balaam: \"Did I not send for you? Why did you not come to me? Did you think I am not able to honor you greatly?\" 38 Balaam replied to Balak: \"Well, I have come to you now. But will I be allowed to say anything? I can only speak words that God puts in my mouth.\"\n39 So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent some to Balaam and the princes who were with him. 41 In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal; from there he could see all the people.\nChapter 23\n1 Then Balaam said to Balak: \"Build on this spot seven altars, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.\" 2 Balak immediately did just as Balaam had said. And Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. 3 Balaam then said to Balak: \"Stay here by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Jehovah will get in touch with me. Whatever he reveals to me, I will tell you.\" So he went to a barren hill.\n4 Then God got in touch with Balaam, who said to Him: \"I set the seven altars in rows, and I offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.\" 5 Jehovah put this word in the mouth of Balaam: \"Return to Balak, and this is what you are to say.\" 6 So he returned and saw that Balak and all the princes of Moab were standing by his burnt offering. 7 Then he spoke this proverbial saying:\n\"Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram,\nFrom the mountains of the east:\n'Do come to curse Jacob for me.\nYes, come to denounce Israel.'\n8 How could I put a curse on those whom God has not cursed?\nAnd how could I denounce those whom Jehovah has not denounced?\n9 From the top of the rocks I see them,\nAnd from the hills I see them.\nAs a people they dwell there alone;\nThey do not count themselves among the nations.\n10 Who can number the dust particles of Jacob\nOr count even the fourth part of Israel?\nLet me die the death of the upright,\nAnd let my end be like theirs.\"\n11 Balak then said to Balaam: \"What have you done to me? I brought you to put a curse on my enemies, and here you have done nothing but bless them.\" 12 He answered: \"Must I not speak whatever Jehovah puts in my mouth?\"\n13 Balak said to him: \"Please come with me to another place from which you can see them. You will see only a part of them; you will not see them all. Put a curse on them for me from there.\" 14 So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. 15 So Balaam said to Balak: \"Stay here by your burnt offering while I get in touch with Him over there.\" 16 And Jehovah got in touch with Balaam and put this word in his mouth: \"Return to Balak, and this is what you are to say.\" 17 So he came to him and saw that he was waiting by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. Balak asked him: \"What has Jehovah said?\" 18 Then he spoke this proverbial saying:\n\"Get up, Balak, and listen.\nHear me, O son of Zippor.\n19 God is not a mere man who tells lies,\nNor a son of man who changes his mind.\nWhen he says something, will he not do it?\nWhen he speaks, will he not carry it out?\n20 Look! I have been taken to bless;\nNow He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.\n21 He does not tolerate any magical power against Jacob,\nAnd he does not allow any trouble against Israel.\nJehovah his God is with them,\nAnd he is loudly hailed as king among them.\n22 God is bringing them out of Egypt.\nHe is like the horns of a wild bull for them.\n23 For there are no omens of doom against Jacob,\nNor any divination against Israel.\nAt this time it may be said about Jacob and Israel:\n'Look at what God has done!'\n24 Here is a people who will rise up like a lion,\nAnd like the lion, it will raise itself up.\nIt will not lie down until it eats prey\nAnd drinks the blood of the slain ones.\"\n25 Balak then said to Balaam: \"If on the one hand you cannot put any curse on him, then on the other hand you should not bless him either.\" 26 Balaam answered Balak: \"Did I not say to you, 'I will do all that Jehovah says'?\"\n27 Balak said to Balaam: \"Please come and let me take you to yet another place. Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of the true God for you to put a curse on him for me from there.\" 28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks toward Jeshimon. 29 Then Balaam said to Balak: \"Build seven altars on this spot, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.\" 30 So Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.\nChapter 24\n1 When Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go away again to search for omens of doom, but he turned his face to the wilderness. 2 When Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel encamped by his tribes, then the spirit of God came upon him. 3 He then spoke this proverbial saying:\n\"The saying of Balaam the son of Beor,\nAnd the saying of a man whose eyes have been opened,\n4 The saying of the one hearing the word of God,\nWho saw a vision of the Almighty,\nWho has bowed down with his eyes uncovered:\n5 How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob,\nYour tabernacles, O Israel!\n6 Like the valleys they have extended a long way,\nLike gardens by the river,\nLike aloes that Jehovah has planted,\nLike cedars by the waters.\n7 Water keeps trickling from his two leather buckets,\nAnd his seed is sown by many waters.\nHis king also will be greater than Agag,\nAnd his kingdom will be exalted.\n8 God is bringing him out of Egypt;\nHe is like the horns of a wild bull for them.\nHe will consume the nations, his oppressors,\nAnd their bones he will gnaw, and he will shatter them with his arrows.\n9 He has crouched down, he has lain down like the lion,\nAnd like a lion, who dares rouse him?\nThose blessing you are blessed,\nAnd those cursing you are cursed.\"\n10 Then Balak became furious with Balaam. Balak scornfully clapped his hands together and said to Balaam: \"It was to put a curse on my enemies that I called you, but now you have done nothing but bless them these three times. 11 Now go home immediately. I intended to honor you greatly, but look! Jehovah has deprived you of honor.\"\n12 Balaam replied to Balak: \"Did I not say to the messengers you sent, 13 'If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not of my own will do anything beyond the order of Jehovah, whether good or bad. I will only speak what Jehovah will tell me'? 14 And now I am going away to my people. Come and let me advise you what this people will do to your people in the future.\" 15 So he spoke this proverbial saying:\n\"The saying of Balaam the son of Beor,\nAnd the saying of a man whose eyes have been opened,\n16 The saying of the one hearing the word of God,\nAnd the one having the knowledge of the Most High,\nA vision of the Almighty he saw\nWhile bowing down with his eyes uncovered:\n17 I will see him, but not now;\nI will behold him, but not soon.\nA star will come out of Jacob,\nAnd a scepter will rise out of Israel.\nAnd he will certainly break apart the forehead of Moab\nAnd the skull of all the sons of tumult.\n18 And Edom will become a possession,\nYes, Seir the possession of his enemies,\nWhile Israel is displaying his courage.\n19 And out of Jacob one will be subduing,\nAnd he will destroy any survivor from the city.\"\n20 When he saw Amalek, he continued his proverbial saying:\n\"Amalek was the first of the nations,\nBut in the end he will perish.\"\n21 When he saw the Kenites, he continued his proverbial saying:\n\"Secure is your dwelling, and set on the crag is your abode.\n22 But someone will burn Kain down.\nHow long before Assyria carries you away captive?\"\n23 And he continued his proverbial saying:\n\"Woe! Who will survive when God does this?\n24 Ships will come from the coast of Kittim,\nAnd they will afflict Assyria,\nAnd they will afflict Eber.\nBut he too will utterly perish.\"\n25 Then Balaam got up and went and returned to his place. Balak also went his own way.\nChapter 25\n1 When Israel was dwelling in Shittim, the people started to commit sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab. 2 The women invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people began to eat and to bow down to their gods. 3 So Israel joined in worship of the Baal of Peor, and Jehovah became enraged with Israel. 4 Jehovah said to Moses: \"Take all the leaders of these people and hang them up before Jehovah in broad daylight, that the burning anger of Jehovah may turn back from Israel.\" 5 Then Moses said to the judges of Israel: \"Each one of you should kill his men who joined in worship of the Baal of Peor.\"\n6 But just then, there came one of the Israelites bringing near to his brothers a Midianite woman before the eyes of Moses and of all the assembly of the Israelites, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 7 When Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it, he immediately rose up from the midst of the assembly and took a spear in his hand. 8 Then he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman through her genital parts. At that the scourge on the Israelites was halted. 9 Those who died from the scourge amounted to 24,000.\n10 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 11 \"Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest has turned my wrath away from the people of Israel because he tolerated no rivalry at all toward me among them. So I have not exterminated the Israelites in my insistence on exclusive devotion. 12 Therefore, say, 'I am giving him my covenant of peace. 13 And it will serve as the covenant of a lasting priesthood for him and his offspring after him, because he tolerated no rivalry toward his God and he made atonement for the people of Israel.'\"\n14 Incidentally, the name of the Israelite man who was put to death along with the Midianitess was Zimri the son of Salu, a chieftain of a paternal house of the Simeonites. 15 The name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was a leader of the clans of a paternal house in Midian.\n16 Jehovah later said to Moses: 17 \"Harass the Midianites and strike them down, 18 because they have been harassing you with their cunning dealings against you in the affair of Peor and of Cozbi the daughter of a chieftain of Midian, their sister who was put to death in the day of the scourge over the affair of Peor.\"\nChapter 26\n1 After the scourge, Jehovah said to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest: 2 \"Take a census of the whole assembly of the Israelites from 20 years of age and up, by their paternal houses, counting all those who can serve in the army in Israel.\" 3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: 4 \"Take a census of them from the age of 20 years and up, just as Jehovah commanded Moses.\"\nNow the sons of Israel who went out of the land of Egypt were: 5 Reuben, Israel's firstborn; Reuben's sons were: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites; 6 of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. 7 These were the families of the Reubenites, and their registered ones amounted to 43,730.\n8 The son of Pallu was Eliab. 9 And the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. This Dathan and Abiram were chosen ones of the assembly who fought against Moses and Aaron along with Korah's group when they fought against Jehovah.\n10 Then the earth opened and swallowed them up. As for Korah, he died with his supporters when the fire consumed 250 men. And they became a warning example. 11 However, the sons of Korah did not die.\n12 The sons of Simeon by their families were: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites; 13 of Zerah, the family of the Zerahites; of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites. 14 These were the families of the Simeonites: 22,200.\n15 The sons of Gad by their families were: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the family of the Haggites; of Shuni, the family of the Shunites; 16 of Ozni, the family of the Oznites; of Eri, the family of the Erites; 17 of Arod, the family of the Arodites; of Areli, the family of the Arelites. 18 These were the families of the sons of Gad, and their registered ones were 40,500.\n19 The sons of Judah were Er and Onan. However, Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. 20 And the sons of Judah by their families were: of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites; of Perez, the family of the Perezites; of Zerah, the family of the Zerahites. 21 And the sons of Perez were: of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the family of the Hamulites. 22 These were the families of Judah, and their registered ones were 76,500.\n23 The sons of Issachar by their families were: of Tola, the family of the Tolaites; of Puvah, the family of the Punites; 24 of Jashub, the family of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the family of the Shimronites. 25 These were the families of Issachar, and their registered ones were 64,300.\n26 The sons of Zebulun by their families were: of Sered, the family of the Seredites; of Elon, the family of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the family of the Jahleelites. 27 These were the families of the Zebulunites, and their registered ones were 60,500.\n28 The sons of Joseph by their families were: Manasseh and Ephraim. 29 The sons of Manasseh were: of Machir, the family of the Machirites; and Machir became father to Gilead; of Gilead, the family of the Gileadites. 30 These were the sons of Gilead: of Iezer, the family of the Iezerites; of Helek, the family of the Helekites; 31 of Asriel, the family of the Asrielites; of Shechem, the family of the Shechemites; 32 of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites; of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites. 33 Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, only daughters, and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 34 These were the families of Manasseh, and their registered ones were 52,700.\n35 These were the sons of Ephraim by their families: of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthelahites; of Becher, the family of the Becherites; of Tahan, the family of the Tahanites. 36 And these were the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites. 37 These were the families of the sons of Ephraim, and their registered ones were 32,500. These were the sons of Joseph by their families.\n38 The sons of Benjamin by their families were: of Bela, the family of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the family of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites; 39 of Shephupham, the family of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the family of the Huphamites. 40 The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the family of the Ardites; of Naaman, the family of the Naamites. 41 These were the sons of Benjamin by their families, and their registered ones were 45,600.\n42 These were the sons of Dan by their families: of Shuham, the family of the Shuhamites. These were the families of Dan by their families. 43 All the families of the Shuhamites, of their registered ones, were 64,400.\n44 The sons of Asher by their families were: of Imnah, the family of the Imnites; of Ishvi, the family of the Ishvites; of Beriah, the family of the Beriites; 45 of the sons of Beriah: of Heber, the family of the Heberites; of Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites. 46 The name of Asher's daughter was Serah. 47 These were the families of the sons of Asher, and their registered ones were 53,400.\n48 The sons of Naphtali by their families were: of Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the family of the Gunites; 49 of Jezer, the family of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the family of the Shillemites. 50 These were the families of Naphtali by their families, and their registered ones were 45,400.\n51 This is the total of those registered of the Israelites: 601,730.\n52 After that Jehovah said to Moses: 53 \"Among these the land should be divided as an inheritance according to the list of the names. 54 For the larger groups, you should increase the inheritance, and for the smaller groups, you should reduce the inheritance. Each group's inheritance should be given in proportion to the number of those registered. 55 However, the land should be apportioned by lot. They should receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers. 56 Each inheritance will be determined by lot and apportioned among the larger and the smaller groups.\"\n57 Now these were the registered ones of the Levites by their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites. 58 These were the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites.\nKohath became father to Amram. 59 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, Levi's daughter, whom his wife bore to Levi in Egypt. And to Amram she bore Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. 60 Then to Aaron there were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 61 But Nadab and Abihu died for presenting unauthorized fire before Jehovah.\n62 The total of those registered was 23,000, all males from a month old and up. For they were not registered among the Israelites, because no inheritance was to be given to them among the Israelites.\n63 These were the ones registered by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they registered the Israelites in the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 64 But among them there was no one who had been registered by Moses and Aaron the priest in the census of the Israelites taken in the wilderness of Sinai. 65 For Jehovah had said concerning them: \"They will die without fail in the wilderness.\" So there was not a man left of them except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.\nChapter 27\n1 Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, approached. The names of his daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 2 They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the chieftains, and all the assembly at the entrance of the tent of meeting and said: 3 \"Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among the group who banded together against Jehovah, the supporters of Korah, but he died for his own sin and he did not have any sons. 4 Why should the name of our father be lost from his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father's brothers.\" 5 So Moses presented their case before Jehovah.\n6 Jehovah then said this to Moses: 7 \"The daughters of Zelophehad are correct. You should by all means give them the possession as an inheritance among their father's brothers and transfer their father's inheritance to them. 8 And tell the Israelites, 'If a man dies without having a son, you must then cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. 9 And if he has no daughter, you will give his inheritance to his brothers. 10 And if he has no brothers, you will give his inheritance to his father's brothers. 11 And if his father has no brothers, you will give his inheritance to the closest blood relative in his family, and he will take possession of it. This will serve as a statute by judicial decision for the Israelites, just as Jehovah has commanded Moses.'\"\n12 Then Jehovah said to Moses: \"Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and view the land that I will give the Israelites. 13 When you have seen it, you will also be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was, 14 because when the assembly was quarreling with me in the wilderness of Zin, you rebelled against my order to sanctify me before them by means of the waters. These are the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.\"\n15 Then Moses said to Jehovah: 16 \"Let Jehovah, the God of the spirit of all people, appoint over the assembly a man 17 who will go out and come in before them and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that Jehovah's assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd.\" 18 So Jehovah said to Moses: \"Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom there is spirit, and lay your hand on him. 19 Then stand him before Eleazar the priest and before all the assembly, and you must commission him before their eyes. 20 You are to confer some of your authority on him, so that all the assembly of the Israelites may listen to him. 21 He will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will inquire in his behalf by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah. At his order they will go out and at his order they will come in, he and all the Israelites with him and all the assembly.\"\n22 So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him. He took Joshua and stood him before Eleazar the priest and before all the assembly, 23 and he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as Jehovah had spoken through Moses.\nChapter 28\n1 Jehovah next said to Moses: 2 \"Command the Israelites and tell them, 'You should take care that you present to me my offering, my bread. My offerings by fire as a pleasing aroma to me must be made at their appointed times.'\n3 \"And say to them, 'This is the offering made by fire that you will present to Jehovah: two sound year-old male lambs a day as a burnt offering regularly. 4 The one male lamb you will offer in the morning, and the other male lamb you will offer at twilight, 5 together with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil as a grain offering. 6 It is a regular burnt offering, which was established at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to Jehovah, 7 along with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin for each male lamb. Pour out the alcoholic drink in the holy place as a drink offering to Jehovah. 8 And you will offer the other male lamb at twilight. With the same grain offering as that made in the morning and with its same drink offering, you will present it as an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah.\n9 \"'However, on the Sabbath day, the offering should be two sound year-old male lambs and two tenths of an ephah measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, together with its drink offering. 10 This is the burnt offering for the Sabbath, along with the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.\n11 \"'At the start of each month you will present as a burnt offering to Jehovah two young bulls, one ram, and seven sound male lambs each a year old, 12 and three tenth measures of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each bull and two tenth measures of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for the one ram, 13 and a tenth measure of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each male lamb, as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 14 And their drink offerings should be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a male lamb. This is the monthly burnt offering each month throughout the year. 15 Also, one young goat should be offered as a sin offering to Jehovah in addition to the regular burnt offering together with its drink offering.\n16 \"'In the first month, on the 14th day of the month, will be Jehovah's Passover. 17 And on the 15th day of this month, there will be a festival. Unleavened bread will be eaten for seven days. 18 On the first day there will be a holy convention. You must not do any hard work. 19 And you will present as a burnt offering made by fire to Jehovah two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs each a year old. You should offer sound animals. 20 You should offer them with their grain offerings of fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth measures for a bull and two tenth measures for the ram. 21 You will offer a tenth measure respectively for each male lamb of the seven male lambs, 22 as well as one goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 23 Aside from the morning burnt offering, which is for the regular burnt offering, you will offer these. 24 You will offer these in the same manner each day for seven days as food, an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to Jehovah. It should be offered along with the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 25 On the seventh day you should hold a holy convention. You must not do any hard work.\n26 \"'On the day of the first ripe fruits, when you present a new grain offering to Jehovah, you should hold a holy convention in your feast of weeks. You must not do any hard work. 27 You will present as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to Jehovah two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs each a year old, 28 and as their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth measures for each bull, two tenth measures for the one ram, 29 a tenth measure respectively for each male lamb of the seven male lambs, 30 as well as one young goat to make atonement for you. 31 You will offer them in addition to the regular burnt offering and its grain offering. They should be sound animals, along with their drink offerings.\nChapter 29\n1 \"'And in the seventh month, on the first of the month, you should hold a holy convention. You must not do any hard work. It is a day on which you should sound the trumpet. 2 You will offer as a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma to Jehovah one young bull, one ram, and seven male lambs each a year old, all of them sound, 3 and their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, three tenths of an ephah measure for the bull, two tenth measures for the ram, 4 and one tenth measure for each male lamb of the seven male lambs, 5 and one young male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 6 This is in addition to the monthly burnt offering and its grain offering and the regular burnt offering and its grain offering, together with their drink offerings, according to the regular procedure for them, as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to Jehovah.\n7 \"'And on the tenth of this seventh month, you should hold a holy convention, and you must afflict yourselves.

He should do everything he vowed he would do.\n3 \"And if a woman makes a vow to Jehovah or she imposes a vow of abstinence on herself when she is young and living in the house of her father 4 and her father hears her vow or her abstinence vow that she has imposed on herself and her father offers no objection, all her vows will stand, and every abstinence vow that she has imposed on herself will stand. 5 But if her father forbids her when he hears that she has imposed vows or abstinence vows on herself, it will not stand. Jehovah will forgive her because her father forbade her.\n6 \"However, if she should marry a husband while under her vow or the rash promise that she has imposed on herself 7 and her husband hears of it and offers no objection on the day he hears of it, her vows or her abstinence vows that she has imposed on herself will stand. 8 But if her husband forbids her on the day he hears of it, he may annul the vow or the rash promise that she imposed on herself, and Jehovah will forgive her.\n9 \"But if a widow or a divorced woman makes a vow, everything that she has imposed on herself will be binding on her.\n10 \"However, if a woman imposed the vow or the abstinence vow on herself while in the house of her husband 11 and her husband heard it and has not objected or disapproved, all her vows or any abstinence vow that she imposed on herself will stand. 12 But if on the day he heard them her husband completely annulled whatever vows or abstinence vow she swore to, they will not stand. Her husband annulled them, and Jehovah will forgive her. 13 Regarding any vow or any oath involving an abstinence vow to practice self-denial, her husband should establish it or her husband should annul it. 14 But if her husband offers no objection at all from day to day, he also establishes all her vows or all her abstinence vows that are upon her. He establishes them because he did not object on the day he heard her make them. 15 But if he annuls them later, sometime after the day he heard them, he will bear the consequences of her guilt.\n16 \"These are the regulations that Jehovah commanded Moses relating to a husband and his wife, and relating to a father and his young daughter living in his house.\"\nChapter 31\n1 Jehovah then told Moses: 2 \"Take vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites. Afterward you will be gathered to your people.\"\n3 So Moses spoke to the people, saying: \"Equip men from among you for battle against Midian and to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian. 4 You should send 1,000 of each tribe of all the tribes of Israel into the army.\" 5 So from the thousands of Israel, 1,000 were assigned from each tribe, 12,000 equipped for battle.\n6 Then Moses sent them out, 1,000 from each tribe to the army, along with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest for the army, who had the holy utensils and the signal trumpets in his hand. 7 They waged war against Midian, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. 8 Along with the others slain, they killed the kings of Midian, namely, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword. 9 But the Israelites carried off captive the women and children of Midian. They also plundered all their domestic animals, all their livestock, and all their possessions. 10 And all their cities in which they had settled and all their encampments they burned with fire. 11 And they took all the spoil and all the plunder, both humans and animals. 12 Then they brought the captives, the plunder, and the spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the assembly of the Israelites, to the camp in the desert plains of Moab near the Jordan at Jericho.\n13 Then Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chieftains of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp. 14 But Moses grew indignant at the appointed men of the combat forces, the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds who were coming in from the military expedition. 15 Moses said to them: \"Have you preserved all the females alive? 16 Look! They are the ones who by Balaam's word induced the Israelites to commit unfaithfulness toward Jehovah over the affair of Peor, so that the scourge came upon the assembly of Jehovah. 17 Now you should kill every male among the children and kill every woman who has had sexual relations with a man. 18 But you may keep alive all the young girls who have not had sexual relations with a man. 19 And you should camp outside the camp seven days. Every one of you who has killed someone and every one of you who has touched someone slain should purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. 20 And you should purify from sin every garment, every article of skin, everything made of goat hair, and every article of wood.\"\n21 Eleazar the priest then said to the men of the army who had gone into the battle: \"This is the statute of the law that Jehovah commanded Moses, 22 'Only the gold, the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 23 everything that can be processed with fire, you should pass through the fire, and it will be clean. However, it should also be purified by the water for cleansing. Everything that cannot be processed with fire, you should pass through the water. 24 And you should wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and then you may come into the camp.'\"\n25 Jehovah then said this to Moses: 26 \"Take an inventory of the plunder, counting the captives both of humans and animals; do this together with Eleazar the priest and the heads of the paternal houses of the assembly. 27 Divide what was plundered into two parts to be shared between those in the army who took part in the battle and all the rest of the assembly. 28 As a tax for Jehovah, you should take from the soldiers who went out into the battle one soul out of every 500, of the people, the herd, the donkeys, and the flock. 29 You should take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as Jehovah's contribution. 30 From the half given to the Israelites, you should take one out of 50, of the people, the herd, the donkeys, the flock, and every sort of domestic animal, and give them to the Levites, who care for the responsibilities connected with Jehovah's tabernacle.\"\n31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 32 The spoils, the rest of the plunder that the people of the expedition had taken, amounted to 675,000 of the flock, 33 72,000 of the herd, 34 and 61,000 donkeys. 35 The women who had not had sexual relations with a man amounted to 32,000 women. 36 The half that was the share of those who went out into the battle amounted to 337,500 of the flock. 37 The tax for Jehovah from the flock amounted to 675. 38 And there were 36,000 of the herd, and the tax on them for Jehovah was 72. 39 And there were 30,500 donkeys, and the tax on them for Jehovah was 61. 40 And there were 16,000 humans, and the tax on them for Jehovah was 32 persons. 41 Then Moses gave the tax as Jehovah's contribution to Eleazar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n42 From the half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses had divided off from the portion that belonged to the men who waged war, 43 that half of the flock amounted to 337,500, 44 and of the herd, 36,000, 45 and of the donkeys, 30,500, 46 and of the people, 16,000. 47 Then Moses took from the half belonging to the Israelites one out of 50, of the people and of the animals, and gave them to the Levites, who cared for the responsibility of Jehovah's tabernacle, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n48 Then the appointed men who were of the thousands of the army, the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds, approached Moses, 49 and they said to Moses: \"Your servants have taken the count of the men of war who are under our command, and not one has been reported missing from us. 50 So let us each present what he has found as Jehovah's offering, articles of gold, ankle chains, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and other jewelry, in order to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.\"\n51 So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from them, all the jewelry. 52 All the gold of the contribution that they made to Jehovah amounted to 16,750 shekels, from the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds. 53 The men of the army had each taken plunder for himself. 54 Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a reminder for the people of Israel before Jehovah.\nChapter 32\n1 Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had very large quantities of livestock, and they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were a good region for livestock. 2 So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the chieftains of the assembly and said: 3 \"Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 4 the land that Jehovah defeated before the assembly of Israel, is a good land for livestock, and your servants have much livestock.\" 5 They continued: \"If we have found favor in your eyes, let this be the land given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.\"\n6 Then Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben: \"Are your brothers to go to war while you yourselves keep dwelling here? 7 Why should you discourage the people of Israel from crossing into the land that Jehovah is certain to give them? 8 That is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. 9 When they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the people of Israel from going into the land that Jehovah was to give them. 10 Jehovah's anger blazed on that day so that he swore: 11 'The men who came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and up will not see the land of which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not followed me wholeheartedly- 12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have followed Jehovah wholeheartedly.' 13 So Jehovah's anger blazed against Israel and he made them wander about in the wilderness for 40 years, until all the generation that was doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah came to its end. 14 Now here you have risen in the place of your fathers as a brood of sinful men who increase the burning anger of Jehovah against Israel. 15 If you turn back from following him, he will certainly leave them again in the wilderness, and you will bring ruin to all this people.\"\n16 They later approached him and said: \"Let us build here stone pens for our livestock and cities for our children. 17 But we will continue ready for battle and will go before the Israelites until we have brought them to their place, while our children will dwell in the fortified cities, safe from the inhabitants of the land. 18 We will not return to our houses until each of the Israelites has received his land as an inheritance. 19 For we will not receive an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because we have received our inheritance on the east side of the Jordan.\"\n20 Moses replied to them: \"If you will do this: Take up arms before Jehovah for the war; 21 and if every one of you takes up arms and crosses the Jordan before Jehovah as he drives away his enemies from before him 22 until the land is subdued before Jehovah, afterward you may return and be free from guilt before Jehovah and Israel. Then this land will become your possession before Jehovah. 23 But if you do not do this, you will have sinned against Jehovah. In that case, know that your sin will catch up with you. 24 So you may build cities for your children and pens for your flocks, but you must do what you have promised.\"\n25 The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben said this to Moses: \"Your servants will do just as my lord is commanding. 26 Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our domestic animals will stay there in the cities of Gilead, 27 but your servants will cross over, every man armed for battle to wage war before Jehovah, just as my lord is speaking.\"\n28 So Moses gave a command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the paternal houses of the tribes of Israel. 29 Moses said to them: \"If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for the war before Jehovah, and the land is subdued before you, you will then give them the land of Gilead as a possession. 30 But if they do not take up arms and cross over with you, they will then settle among you in the land of Canaan.\"\n31 To this the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered: \"What Jehovah has spoken to your servants is what we will do. 32 We will take up arms and cross over before Jehovah to the land of Canaan, but the possession we are to inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.\" 33 So Moses gave to them-to the sons of Gad, the sons of Reuben, and to the half tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph-the kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, the land belonging to its cities in those territories, and the cities of the surrounding land.\n34 And the sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 35 Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 36 Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities, and they built stone pens for the flocks. 37 And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 38 Nebo, and Baal-meon-their names being changed-and Sibmah; and they began to rename the cities that they rebuilt.\n39 The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh marched against Gilead and captured it and drove away the Amorites who were in it. 40 So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he began dwelling in it. 41 And Jair the son of Manasseh marched against them and captured their tent villages, and he began to call them Havvoth-jair. 42 And Nobah marched against and captured Kenath and its dependent towns, and he began to call it Nobah by his own name.\nChapter 33\n1 These were the stages of the journey of the people of Israel when they went out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the direction of Moses and Aaron. 2 Moses kept recording the departure places by the stages of their journey at the order of Jehovah, and these were their stages from one departure place to another: 3 They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the 15th day of the month. On the very day after the Passover, the Israelites went out with confidence before the eyes of all the Egyptians. 4 Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying all the firstborn whom Jehovah had struck down among them, for Jehovah had executed judgments on their gods.\n5 So the Israelites departed from Rameses and camped at Succoth. 6 Then they departed from Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness. 7 Next they departed from Etham and turned back toward Pihahiroth, which is in view of Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol. 8 After that they departed from Pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea to the wilderness and kept marching a three-day journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.\n9 Then they departed from Marah and came to Elim. Now in Elim there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees, so they camped there. 10 Next they departed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea. 11 After that they departed from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin. 12 Then they departed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah. 13 Later they departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush. 14 They next departed from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink. 15 After that they departed from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.\n16 They departed from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. 17 Then they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. 18 After that they departed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah. 19 Next they departed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez. 20 Then they departed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah. 21 They departed from Libnah and camped at Rissah. 22 Next they departed from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. 23 Then they departed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.\n24 After that they departed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. 25 Then they departed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. 26 Next they departed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. 27 After that they departed from Tahath and camped at Terah. 28 Then they departed from Terah and camped at Mithkah. 29 Later they departed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. 30 Next they departed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. 31 Then they departed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan. 32 And they departed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad. 33 Next they departed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. 34 Later they departed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. 35 Then they departed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber. 36 After that they departed from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh.\n37 Later they departed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the frontier of the land of Edom. 38 And Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the order of Jehovah and died there in the 40th year after the Israelites left the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first of the month. 39 Aaron was 123 years old at his death on Mount Hor.\n40 Now the king of Arad, the Canaanite who was dwelling in the Negeb in the land of Canaan, heard about the coming of the Israelites.\n41 In time they departed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. 42 After that they departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. 43 Next they departed from Punon and camped at Oboth. 44 Then they departed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, on the border of Moab. 45 Later they departed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad. 46 After that they departed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim. 47 Then they departed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim before Nebo. 48 Finally they departed from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 49 They continued camping along the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim, on the desert plains of Moab.\n50 Jehovah spoke to Moses on the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: 51 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'You are crossing the Jordan into the land of Canaan. 52 You must drive away all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their carvings of stone and all their metal statues, and you should demolish all their sacred high places. 53 And you will take possession of the land and dwell in it, because I will certainly give you the land as a possession. 54 You must apportion the land by lot as a possession among your families. To the larger group you should increase his inheritance, and to the smaller group you should reduce his inheritance. Everyone's inheritance will be where his lot falls. You will receive your property as an inheritance by the tribes of your fathers.\n55 \"'If, though, you do not drive the inhabitants of the land away from before you, those whom you allow to remain will be as irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land where you will dwell. 56 And I will do to you what I intended to do to them.'\"\nChapter 34\n1 And Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 2 \"Give these instructions to the Israelites: 'When you go into the land of Canaan, this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries.\n3 \"'Your southern border will extend from the wilderness of Zin alongside Edom, and your south boundary on the east will be from the extremity of the Salt Sea. 4 Your boundary will change direction to pass south of the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin, and its end will be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will extend to Hazar-addar and continue to Azmon. 5 The boundary will change direction at Azmon to the Wadi of Egypt, and its end will be at the Sea.\n6 \"'Your western boundary will be the Great Sea and the coast. This will become your western boundary.\n7 \"'Now this will be your northern boundary: From the Great Sea you will mark your boundary out to Mount Hor. 8 From Mount Hor you will mark out the boundary to Lebo-hamath, and the end of the boundary will be at Zedad. 9 And the boundary will extend to Ziphron, and its end will be Hazar-enan. This will become your northern boundary.\n10 \"'Then you should mark as your boundary on the east from Hazar-enan to Shepham. 11 The boundary will extend from Shepham to Riblah on the east of Ain, and the border will go down and cross the eastern slope of the Sea of Chinnereth. 12 The border will extend to the Jordan, and its end will be the Salt Sea. This will be your land and the boundaries surrounding it.'\"\n13 So Moses instructed the Israelites, saying: \"This is the land that you will apportion as your possession by lot, just as Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes. 14 For the tribe of the Reubenites by their paternal house, the tribe of the Gadites by their paternal house, and the half tribe of Manasseh have already taken their inheritance. 15 The two and a half tribes have already taken their inheritance east of the region of the Jordan by Jericho, toward the sunrising.\"\n16 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 17 \"These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you to possess: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun. 18 And you will take one chieftain out of each tribe to divide the land as your inheritance. 19 These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 20 of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud; 21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon; 22 of the tribe of the sons of Dan, a chieftain, Bukki the son of Jogli; 23 of the sons of Joseph from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, a chieftain, Hanniel the son of Ephod; 24 from the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, a chieftain, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan; 25 of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, a chieftain, Elizaphan the son of Parnach; 26 of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, a chieftain, Paltiel the son of Azzan; 27 of the tribe of the sons of Asher, a chieftain, Ahihud the son of Shelomi; 28 of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, a chieftain, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.\" 29 These are the ones whom Jehovah commanded to distribute the land to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.\nChapter 35\n1 Jehovah went on to speak to Moses on the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: 2 \"Instruct the Israelites that they are to give the Levites cities to inhabit out of the inheritance they will possess, and they should give the Levites the pastures around the cities. 3 They will inhabit the cities, and the pastures will be for their livestock, their goods, and all their other animals. 4 The pastures of the cities that you will give the Levites will extend for 1,000 cubits from the wall all around the city. 5 You should measure outside the city 2,000 cubits on the east side, 2,000 cubits on the south side, 2,000 cubits on the west side, and 2,000 cubits on the north side, with the city in the middle. These will be the pastures of their cities.\n6 \"The cities that you will give to the Levites will be 6 cities of refuge, which you will give for the manslayer to flee to, as well as 42 other cities. 7 You are to give to the Levites a total of 48 cities, together with their pastures. 8 The cities you give them will be from the possession of the Israelites. From the larger group you will take many, and from the smaller group you will take few. Each group will give some of its cities to the Levites in proportion to the inheritance that it receives.\"\n9 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 10 \"Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'You are crossing the Jordan to the land of Canaan. 11 You should choose cities convenient for yourselves to serve as cities of refuge, where the manslayer who unintentionally kills someone should flee. 12 These cities will serve as a refuge for you from the blood avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly. 13 The six cities of refuge that you provide will serve this purpose. 14 You will provide three cities on this side of the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan to serve as cities of refuge. 15 These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites, for the foreign resident, and for the settler among them, for anyone to flee there who unintentionally kills someone.\n16 \"'But if he struck him with an iron instrument and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer should be put to death without fail. 17 And if he struck him with a stone that could cause death and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer should be put to death without fail. 18 And if he struck him with a wooden instrument that could cause death and he dies, he is a murderer. The murderer should be put to death without fail.\n19 \"'The avenger of blood is the one who will put the murderer to death. When he encounters him, he himself will put him to death. 20 If death resulted because he pushed him out of hatred or threw something at him with malicious intent, 21 or out of hatred he struck him with his hand, and he died, the one who struck him will be put to death without fail. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood will put the murderer to death when he encounters him.\n22 \"'But if it was unexpectedly and not out of hatred that he pushed him or threw any article at him without malicious intent, 23 or if he did not see him and caused a stone to fall on him and he was not an enemy or seeking his injury, and the person died, 24 the assembly should then judge between the one who struck him and the avenger of blood, in harmony with these judgments. 25 The assembly should then save the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood and return him to his city of refuge to which he had fled, and he must dwell in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.\n26 \"'But if the manslayer goes out of the boundary of his city of refuge to which he fled 27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the boundary of his city of refuge and slays the manslayer, he has no bloodguilt. 28 For he must dwell in his city of refuge until the high priest's death. But after the high priest's death, the manslayer may return to the land that he owns. 29 These things will serve for you as a statute for judgment throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.\n30 \"'Whoever kills a person should be put to death as a murderer on the testimony of witnesses; but no one will be put to death on the testimony of just one witness. 31 You must take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is deserving to die, for he should be put to death without fail. 32 And you must not take a ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge, allowing him to resume dwelling in his land before the death of the high priest.\n33 \"'You must not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and there may be no atonement for the blood that has been spilled on the land except by the blood of the one who spilled it. 34 You must not defile the land in which you dwell, in which I am residing; for I, Jehovah, am residing in the midst of the people of Israel.'\"\nChapter 36\n1 The family heads of the descendants of Gilead the son of Machir the son of Manasseh of the families of the sons of Joseph approached and spoke before Moses and the chieftains, the family heads of the Israelites. 2 They said: \"Jehovah commanded my lord to distribute the land by lot as an inheritance to the Israelites; and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. 3 If they marry men from another Israelite tribe, the women's inheritance will also be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they would then belong, so that it would be withdrawn from the lot of our inheritance. 4 Now when the Jubilee takes place for the people of Israel, the women's inheritance will also be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they then belong, so that their inheritance would be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.\"\n5 Then Moses commanded the Israelites at the order of Jehovah: \"What the tribe of the sons of Joseph is saying is correct. 6 This is the word that Jehovah has commanded for the daughters of Zelophehad: 'They may marry whomever they wish. However, they should marry someone from a family of the tribe of their father. 7 No inheritance of the Israelites should circulate from tribe to tribe, for the Israelites should hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of their forefathers. 8 And every daughter who possesses an inheritance among the tribes of Israel should become a wife of a descendant of her father's tribe, so that the Israelites may keep possession of the inheritance of their forefathers. 9 No inheritance should circulate from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of Israel should hold on to their own inheritance.'\"\n10 The daughters of Zelophehad did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 11 So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married the sons of their father's brothers. 12 They became wives of men from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph so that their inheritance would remain in the tribe of their father's family.\n13 These are the commandments and the judicial decisions that Jehovah gave to the Israelites through Moses on the desert plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. \n",

    "text": "Deuteronomy\nChapter 1\n1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the region of the Jordan in the wilderness, on the desert plains in front of Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 2 It is 11 days from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir. 3 In the 40th year, in the 11th month, on the first of the month, Moses spoke to the Israelites according to all that Jehovah had instructed him to tell them. 4 This was after he defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was dwelling in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who was dwelling in Ashtaroth, in Edrei. 5 In the region of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this Law, saying:\n6 \"Jehovah our God told us in Horeb, 'You have stayed long enough in this mountainous region. 7 Turn and set out for the mountainous region of the Amorites and toward all their neighbors in the Arabah, the mountainous region, the Shephelah, the Negeb, and the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, up to the great river, the river Euphrates. 8 See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land about which Jehovah swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them and their offspring after them.'\n9 \"And I told you at that time, 'I am not able to carry you by myself. 10 Jehovah your God has multiplied you, and here you are today as numerous as the stars of the heavens. 11 May Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, multiply you a thousand times as many as you are, and may he bless you just as he has promised you. 12 How can I bear by myself the burden of you and the load of you and your quarreling? 13 Select wise, discreet, and experienced men of your tribes, and I will appoint them as heads over you.' 14 You answered me, 'What you have told us to do is good.' 15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them as heads over you, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, chiefs of tens, and officers of your tribes.\n16 \"At that time I instructed your judges, 'When you hear a case between your brothers, you are to judge with righteousness between a man and his brother or a foreign resident. 17 You must not be partial in judgment. You should hear the small one the same as the great one. You must not become intimidated by men, for the judgment belongs to God; and if a case is too difficult for you, you should present it to me, and I will hear it.' 18 At that time I instructed you regarding all the things that you should do.\n19 \"Then we departed from Horeb and marched through all that great and fearsome wilderness that you saw on the way to the mountainous region of the Amorites, just as Jehovah our God had commanded us, and we eventually came to Kadesh-barnea. 20 I then said to you, 'You have come to the mountainous region of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us. 21 See, Jehovah your God has given the land over to you. Go up, take possession of it, just as Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or terrified.'\n22 \"However, all of you approached me and said, 'Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land for us and bring word back to us as to what route we should take and what kind of cities we will encounter.' 23 The suggestion seemed good to me, so I selected 12 of your men, one for each tribe. 24 They left and went up into the mountainous region and reached the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out. 25 They took some of the fruitage of the land and carried it back to us, and they brought word back to us, 'The land that Jehovah our God is giving us is good.' 26 But you refused to go up, and you rebelled against the order of Jehovah your God. 27 You kept grumbling in your tents and were saying, 'It was because Jehovah hated us that he brought us out of the land of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites to annihilate us. 28 What kind of place are we going to? Our brothers made us lose heart by saying, \"They are a people greater and taller than we are, and their cities are great and fortified to the heavens, and we saw the sons of the Anakim there.\"'\n29 \"So I said to you, 'Do not be struck with terror or be afraid because of them. 30 Jehovah your God will go before you and will fight for you, just as he did in Egypt before your very eyes. 31 And you saw in the wilderness how Jehovah your God carried you just as a man carries his son, everywhere you went until you came to this place.' 32 But despite all of this, you did not put faith in Jehovah your God, 33 who was going ahead of you on the way, to spy out a place for you to camp. He appeared by fire at night and by a cloud in the daytime to show you the way you should walk.\n34 \"All the while Jehovah heard what you were saying, and he became indignant and solemnly swore, 35 'Not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers, 36 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give the land on which he walked to him and to his sons, because he has followed Jehovah wholeheartedly. 37 (Jehovah even became angry with me because of you, and he said, \"You too will not go in there. 38 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, is the one who will enter into the land. Make him strong, for he will cause Israel to inherit it.\") 39 Moreover, your children who you said would become plunder and your sons who today do not know good or bad, these will enter, and I will give it to them to possess. 40 But as for you, turn back and depart for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.'\n41 \"At this you said to me, 'We have sinned against Jehovah. We will now go up and fight, just as Jehovah our God has commanded us!' So each of you put on his weapons of war, and you thought it would be an easy thing to go up the mountain. 42 But Jehovah said to me, 'Tell them: \"You must not go up and fight, for I will not be with you. If you do, you will be defeated by your enemies.\"' 43 So I spoke to you, but you did not listen. Instead, you rebelled against Jehovah's order and presumptuously tried to go up the mountain. 44 Then the Amorites who were dwelling in that mountain came out to meet you and chased you away like bees do, and they scattered you in Seir as far as Hormah. 45 So you returned and began to weep before Jehovah, but Jehovah did not listen to you or pay attention to you. 46 That is why you kept dwelling in Kadesh for as long as you did.\nChapter 2\n1 \"Then we turned and departed for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, just as Jehovah had told me, and we traveled for many days around Mount Seir. 2 Finally Jehovah said to me, 3 'You have gone around this mountain long enough. Now turn north. 4 And give this command to the people: \"You will pass by the border of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, and they will be afraid of you, and you must be very careful. 5 Do not engage in hostilities with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even the space of a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession. 6 You should give them money for the food you will eat, and you should pay for the water you will drink. 7 For Jehovah your God has blessed you in all that you have done. He is fully aware of your walking through this great wilderness. These 40 years Jehovah your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.\"' 8 So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, keeping away from the way of the Arabah, from Elath and from Ezion-geber.\n\"Next we turned and traveled by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 9 Jehovah then said to me, 'Do not engage in hostilities or in war with Moab, for I will not give you any of his land as a possession because I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot. 10 (The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and numerous and tall like the Anakim. 11 The Rephaim were also considered like the Anakim, and the Moabites used to call them Emim. 12 Previously, the Horites were living in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed and annihilated them and settled in their place, just as Israel will do to the land that is their possession, which Jehovah will certainly give to them.) 13 Now go and cross over the Valley of Zered.' So we crossed over the Valley of Zered. 14 The time it took us to walk from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Valley of Zered was 38 years, until the entire generation of the men of war had perished from the camp, just as Jehovah had sworn to them. 15 Jehovah's hand was against them to eliminate them from the camp until they had perished.\n16 \"As soon as all the men of war had died off from among the people, 17 Jehovah spoke to me again, saying, 18 'Today you are to pass by the territory of Moab, that is, Ar. 19 When you come near to the Ammonites, do not harass or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession, because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession. 20 This too used to be considered the land of the Rephaim. (The Rephaim formerly lived there, and the Ammonites used to call them Zamzummim. 21 They were a great and numerous and tall people like the Anakim; but Jehovah annihilated them before the Ammonites, and these drove them out and settled in their place. 22 That is what he did for the descendants of Esau, who now dwell in Seir, when he annihilated the Horites from before them, so that they could dispossess them and dwell in their place to this very day. 23 As for the Avvim, they had dwelled in settlements as far as Gaza until the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, annihilated them and settled in their place.)\n24 \"'Get up, and make your way across the Arnon Valley. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon. So begin taking possession of his land, and engage him in war. 25 This day I will start to put the dread and the fear of you upon all the people under the heavens who hear the report about you. They will be disturbed and will tremble because of you.'\n26 \"Then I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon, with these peaceful words, 27 'Let me pass through your land. I will remain on the road and not turn to the right or to the left. 28 I will eat only the food and drink only the water that you will sell to me. Just allow me to pass through on foot 29 -that is what the descendants of Esau dwelling in Seir and the Moabites dwelling in Ar did for me-until I pass over the Jordan into the land that Jehovah our God is giving to us.' 30 But King Sihon of Heshbon did not let us pass through, because Jehovah your God allowed his spirit to become obstinate and his heart to become hard, in order to give him into your hand as is now the case.\n31 \"Then Jehovah said to me, 'See, I have already begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Start to take possession of his land.' 32 When Sihon came out along with all his people to meet us in battle at Jahaz, 33 Jehovah our God handed him over to us, so that we defeated him, his sons, and all his people. 34 We captured all his cities at that time and devoted every city to destruction, including men, women, and children. We left no survivor. 35 We plundered only the livestock for ourselves along with the spoils from the cities that we had captured. 36 From Aroer, which is on the rim of the Arnon Valley (including the city that is in the valley), as far as Gilead, no town was beyond our reach. Jehovah our God handed them all over to us. 37 However, you did not approach the land of the Ammonites, the whole bank of the Valley of Jabbok and the cities of the mountainous region, or any other place forbidden by Jehovah our God.\nChapter 3\n1 \"Then we turned and went up by the Way of Bashan. And Og, the king of Bashan, came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Edrei. 2 So Jehovah said to me, 'Do not be afraid of him, for I will give him and all his people and his land into your hand, and you will do to him just as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.' 3 So Jehovah our God also gave King Og of Bashan and all his people into our hand, and we kept striking him down until none of his people survived. 4 We then captured all his cities. There was no town that we did not take from them-60 cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 5 All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, along with a great number of rural towns. 6 However, we devoted them to destruction, just as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, in devoting every city to destruction, including men, women, and children. 7 And we took all the livestock and the spoil of the cities for ourselves.\n8 \"At that time we seized the land of the two Amorite kings who were in the region of the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon 9 (the mountain that the Sidonians used to call Sirion and the Amorites used to call Senir), 10 all the cities of the tableland, all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom that belonged to Og in Bashan. 11 For King Og of Bashan was the last remaining one of the Rephaim. His bier was made of iron, and it is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites. It is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, by the standard cubit. 12 At that time we took possession of this land: from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, and half of the mountainous region of Gilead, and I have given its cities to the Reubenites and the Gadites. 13 And the rest of Gilead and all Bashan of the kingdom of Og I have given to the half tribe of Manasseh. All the region of Argob, which belongs to Bashan, was known as the land of the Rephaim.\n14 \"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites and named those villages of Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair, to this day. 15 And I have given Gilead to Machir. 16 And to the Reubenites and the Gadites, I have given from Gilead to the Arnon Valley, with the middle of the valley as a boundary, and as far as Jabbok, the valley that is the boundary of the Ammonites, 17 and the Arabah and the Jordan and the border, from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the base of the slopes of Pisgah toward the east.\n18 \"I then gave you this command: 'Jehovah your God has given you this land to take possession of it. All your valiant men will take up arms and cross over before your brothers, the Israelites. 19 Only your wives, your children, and your livestock (I well know that you have a great deal of livestock) will continue dwelling in the cities that I have given you, 20 until Jehovah gives your brothers rest, as he does for you, and they also have taken possession of the land that Jehovah your God will give them across the Jordan. Then you will come back, each one to his possession that I have given you.'\n21 \"At that time I gave this command to Joshua: 'You have seen with your own eyes what Jehovah your God has done to these two kings. Jehovah will do the same thing to all the kingdoms into which you will cross over. 22 You must not be afraid of them, for Jehovah your God is the one fighting for you.'\n23 \"At that time I pleaded with Jehovah, saying, 24 'O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty arm, for what god in the heavens or on the earth performs such mighty deeds as you? 25 Please let me pass over and see the good land that is across the Jordan, this good mountainous region and Lebanon.' 26 But Jehovah was still furious with me because of you, and he would not listen to me. Rather, Jehovah said to me, 'Enough from you! Never speak to me again about this matter. 27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and look to the west and north and south and east and view the land with your eyes, for you will not cross over this Jordan. 28 Commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because he is the one who will cross over before this people and he is the one who will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.' 29 All this happened while we were dwelling in the valley in front of Beth-peor.\nChapter 4\n1 \"Now, O Israel, listen to the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am teaching you to observe, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, is giving you. 2 You must not add to the word that I am commanding you, neither must you take away from it, so as to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God that I am commanding you.\n3 \"Your own eyes have seen what Jehovah did in the case of the Baal of Peor; Jehovah your God annihilated from your midst every man who walked after the Baal of Peor. 4 But you who are holding fast to Jehovah your God are all alive today. 5 See, I have taught you regulations and judicial decisions, just as Jehovah my God has commanded me, so that you may observe them in the land you will take possession of. 6 You must carefully follow them, because this will show wisdom and understanding on your part before the peoples who will hear about all these regulations, and they will say, 'This great nation is undoubtedly a wise and understanding people.' 7 For what great nation has gods as near to it as Jehovah our God is to us whenever we call on him? 8 And what great nation has righteous regulations and judicial decisions like this entire Law that I am putting before you today?\n9 \"Just be careful and watch yourself closely, so that you may not forget the things that your eyes have seen and so that they may not depart from your heart all the days of your life. You must also make them known to your sons and to your grandsons. 10 On the day that you stood before Jehovah your God in Horeb, Jehovah said to me, 'Congregate the people together to me so that I may let them hear my words, in order that they may learn to fear me all the days that they are alive on the ground and that they may teach their sons.'\n11 \"So you came near and stood at the base of the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the very heavens; there was darkness, cloud, and thick gloom. 12 And Jehovah began to speak to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but you saw no form-there was only a voice. 13 And he declared his covenant to you, which he commanded you to observe-the Ten Commandments. Afterward, he wrote them on two tablets of stone. 14 At that time Jehovah commanded me to teach you regulations and judicial decisions, which you are to observe in the land you will enter to take possession of.\n15 \"Therefore, watch yourselves closely-since you did not see any form on the day Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire- 16 that you may not act corruptly by making for yourselves any carved image having the form of any symbol, the representation of male or female, 17 the representation of any animal on the earth or the representation of any bird that flies in the sky, 18 the representation of anything creeping on the ground or the representation of any fish in the waters under the earth. 19 And when you raise your eyes to the heavens and see the sun and the moon and the stars-all the army of the heavens-do not get seduced and bow down to them and serve them. Jehovah your God has given them to all the peoples under the whole heavens. 20 But you are the ones Jehovah took and brought out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to become the people of his personal possession, as you are today.\n21 \"Jehovah became angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan or go into the good land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance. 22 For I am to die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan, but you will cross over and take possession of this good land. 23 Be careful that you do not forget the covenant of Jehovah your God that he made with you, and do not make for yourselves a carved image, the form of anything forbidden to you by Jehovah your God. 24 For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire, a God who requires exclusive devotion.\n25 \"If you become father to sons and grandsons and you have lived a long time in the land and you act ruinously and make a carved image of any kind and you do what is evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God so as to offend him, 26 I do take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that you will surely and quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of. You will not last long on it, but you will be utterly annihilated. 27 Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and just a few of you will survive among the nations to which Jehovah will have driven you. 28 There you will have to serve gods of wood and stone made by human hands, gods that cannot see or hear or eat or smell.\n29 \"If you search for Jehovah your God from there, you will certainly find him, if you inquire for him with all your heart and with all your soul. 30 When you are in great distress and all these things have happened to you in later times, then you will return to Jehovah your God and listen to his voice. 31 For Jehovah your God is a merciful God. He will not desert you or bring you to ruin or forget the covenant that he swore to your forefathers.\n32 \"Ask, now, about the former days before your time, from the day when God created man on the earth; search from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens. Has anything so great ever happened or has anything like it ever been heard of? 33 Have any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire the way you have heard it and kept on living? 34 Or has God ever attempted to take for himself a nation out of the midst of another nation along with judgments, with signs, with miracles, with war, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with terrifying deeds, as Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes? 35 You yourselves have been shown these things so you will know that Jehovah is the true God; there is no other besides him. 36 He made you hear his voice from the heavens to correct you, and on the earth he made you see his great fire, and his words you heard from out of the fire.\n37 \"Because he loved your forefathers and has chosen their offspring after them, you were brought out of Egypt in his presence by his great power. 38 From before you he drove away nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance, as it is today. 39 Know, therefore, on this day, and take it to heart that Jehovah is the true God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. There is no other. 40 You must keep his regulations and his commandments that I am commanding you today, in order that it may go well with you and your sons after you, so that you may long remain in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.\"\n41 At that time Moses set apart three cities on the eastern side of the Jordan. 42 If any manslayer unintentionally kills his fellow man and he did not previously hate him, he must flee to one of these cities and live. 43 The cities are Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.\n44 Now this is the Law that Moses set before the people of Israel. 45 These are the reminders, the regulations, and the judicial decisions that Moses gave to the Israelites after they came out of Egypt, 46 in the region of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who was dwelling in Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites defeated after coming out of Egypt. 47 And they took possession of his land and of the land of King Og of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who were in the region east of the Jordan, 48 from Aroer, which is on the rim of the Arnon Valley, up to Mount Sion, that is, Hermon, 49 and all the Arabah in the region east of the Jordan, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, at the base of the slopes of Pisgah.\nChapter 5\n1 Moses then summoned all Israel and said to them: \"Hear, O Israel, the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am announcing to you today, and you must learn them and carefully observe them. 2 Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 3 It was not with our forefathers that Jehovah made this covenant, but with us, all of us alive here today. 4 Jehovah spoke face-to-face with you in the mountain, out of the fire. 5 I was standing between Jehovah and you at that time to convey to you the word of Jehovah, for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain. He said:\n6 \"'I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 7 You must never have any other gods besides me.\n8 \"'You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth. 9 You must not bow down to them nor be led to serve them, for I, Jehovah your God, am a God who requires exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the error of fathers upon sons, upon the third generation and upon the fourth generation of those who hate me, 10 but showing loyal love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.\n11 \"'You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave anyone unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.\n12 \"'Observe the Sabbath day to keep it sacred, just as Jehovah your God commanded you. 13 You are to labor and do all your work in six days, 14 but the seventh day is a sabbath to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work, neither you nor your son nor your daughter nor your slave man nor your slave girl nor your bull nor your donkey nor any of your domestic animals nor your foreign resident who is inside your cities, in order that your slave man and your slave girl may rest the same as you. 15 Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. That is why Jehovah your God commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.\n16 \"'Honor your father and your mother, just as Jehovah your God has commanded you, so that you may live a long time and you may prosper in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.\n17 \"'You must not murder.\n18 \"'Neither must you commit adultery.\n19 \"'Neither must you steal.\n20 \"'Neither must you testify to a falsehood against your fellow man.\n21 \"'Neither must you desire your fellow man's wife. Neither must you selfishly desire your fellow man's house nor his field nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his donkey nor anything that belongs to your fellow man.'\n22 \"These commandments Jehovah spoke to all your congregation on the mountain, out of the fire, the cloud, and the thick gloom, with a loud voice, and he added nothing further; then he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.\n23 \"But as soon as you had heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, all the heads of your tribes and the elders approached me. 24 Then you said, 'Here Jehovah our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that God can speak with man and he can keep living. 25 Now, why should we die? For this great fire may consume us. If we continue hearing the voice of Jehovah our God, we are sure to die. 26 For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire as we did and yet goes on living? 27 You yourself must go near to hear all that Jehovah our God will say, and you will be the one to tell us all that Jehovah our God says to you, and we will listen and do it.'\n28 \"So Jehovah heard the words you spoke to me, and Jehovah said to me, 'I have heard the words that this people have spoken to you. All they have said is good. 29 If only they would always have a heart inclined to fear me and to keep all my commandments; then it would go well with them and their sons forever! 30 Go say to them: \"Return to your tents.\" 31 But you should stay here with me, and let me tell you all the commandments, the regulations, and the judicial decisions that you should teach to them and that they are to observe in the land that I am giving them to take possession of.' 32 Now you people should be careful to do just as Jehovah your God has commanded you. You must not turn to the right or to the left. 33 You should walk in all the way that Jehovah your God has commanded you, in order that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will take possession of.\nChapter 6\n1 \"Now these are the commandments, the regulations, and the judicial decisions that Jehovah your God has given to teach you, so that you may observe them when you cross over into the land that you are to take possession of, 2 in order that you may fear Jehovah your God and keep all his statutes and his commandments that I am commanding you-you and your son and your grandson-all the days of your life, so that you may live a long time. 3 And you must listen, O Israel, and carefully observe them, so that you may prosper and become very many in the land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, has promised you.\n4 \"Listen, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah. 5 You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength. 6 These words that I am commanding you today must be on your heart, 7 and you must inculcate them in your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. 8 Tie them as a reminder on your hand, and they must be like a headband on your forehead. 9 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.\n10 \"When Jehovah your God brings you into the land that he swore to your forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give you-great and fine cities that you did not build, 11 houses full of all sorts of good things that you did not work for, hewn cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant-and you have eaten and become satisfied, 12 be careful not to forget Jehovah, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 13 Jehovah your God you should fear, and him you should serve, and by his name you should swear. 14 You must not follow after other gods, any gods of the peoples who are all around you, 15 for Jehovah your God who is in your midst is a God who requires exclusive devotion. Otherwise, the anger of Jehovah your God will blaze against you and he will annihilate you from the face of the earth.\n16 \"You must not put Jehovah your God to the test the way you put him to the test at Massah. 17 You should diligently observe the commandments of Jehovah your God and his reminders and his regulations that he has commanded you to observe. 18 You must do what is right and good in Jehovah's eyes, in order that you may prosper and that you may enter and take possession of the good land about which Jehovah has sworn to your forefathers, 19 by driving out all your enemies from before you, just as Jehovah has promised.\n20 \"In the future, when your son asks you, 'What is the meaning of the reminders, the regulations, and the judicial decisions that Jehovah our God has commanded you?' 21 then you will say to your son, 'We became slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 22 So before our eyes Jehovah kept sending signs and miracles, great and devastating, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household. 23 And he brought us out from there in order to bring us here to give us the land about which he had sworn to our forefathers. 24 Then Jehovah commanded us to carry out all these regulations and to fear Jehovah our God for our lasting good, so that we could keep alive, as we are today. 25 And it will mean righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all these commandments in obedience to Jehovah our God, just as he has commanded us.'\nChapter 7\n1 \"When Jehovah your God brings you into the land you are about to enter and take possession of, he will also clear away populous nations from before you: the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations more populous and mightier than you are. 2 Jehovah your God will give them over to you, and you will defeat them. You should without fail devote them to destruction. You must not make any covenant with them nor show them any favor. 3 You must not form any marriage alliances with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. 4 For they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods; then Jehovah's anger will blaze against you, and he will swiftly annihilate you.\n5 \"Instead, this is what you should do to them: Tear down their altars, break up their sacred pillars, cut down their sacred poles, and burn up their graven images. 6 For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God, and Jehovah your God has chosen you to become his people, his special property, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.\n7 \"It was not because you were the most numerous of all the peoples that Jehovah showed affection for you and chose you, for you were the smallest of all the peoples. 8 Rather, it was because of Jehovah's love for you and because he kept the oath that he had sworn to your forefathers that Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, to redeem you from the house of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 9 You well know that Jehovah your God is the true God, the faithful God, keeping his covenant and loyal love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face with destruction. He will not be slow to deal with those who hate him; he will repay them to their face. 11 Therefore, take care to keep the commandments and the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am commanding you today, by observing them.\n12 \"If you continue listening to these judicial decisions and you observe them and carry them out, Jehovah your God will keep the covenant and the loyal love about which he swore to your forefathers. 13 He will love you and bless you and multiply you. Yes, he will bless you with many children and with the produce of your soil, your grain, your new wine, your oil, the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks, in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give to you. 14 You will become the most blessed of all the peoples; no man or woman among you will be childless, nor will your livestock be without young. 15 Jehovah will take away from you all sickness, and he will not bring upon you any of the terrible diseases that you have known in Egypt. Instead, he will bring them upon all those who hate you. 16 You are to destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God gives over to you. You must not feel sorry for them, and you must not serve their gods, because that would be a snare to you.\n17 \"If you should say in your heart, 'These nations outnumber us. How can I drive them away?' 18 you must not be afraid of them. You should remind yourself of what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt, 19 the great judgments that your eyes saw and the signs and the miracles and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm with which Jehovah your God brought you out. That is what Jehovah your God will do to all the peoples you fear. 20 Jehovah your God will send the feeling of dejection upon them until those who were left remaining and who were concealing themselves from before you perish. 21 Do not be struck with terror because of them, for Jehovah your God is with you, a great and awe-inspiring God.\n22 \"Jehovah your God will certainly drive these nations away from before you little by little. You will not be allowed to put an end to them quickly, so that the wild animals of the field will not multiply against you. 23 Jehovah your God will give them over to you and utterly defeat them until they are annihilated. 24 He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under the heavens. Nobody will stand up to you, until you have exterminated them. 25 You should burn the graven images of their gods in the fire. Do not desire the silver and the gold on them or take it for yourself, so that you are not ensnared by it, for it is something detestable to Jehovah your God. 26 You must not bring a detestable thing into your house and thereby become something devoted to destruction like it. You should utterly loathe it and absolutely detest it, because it is something devoted to destruction.\nChapter 8\n1 \"You should be careful to observe every commandment that I am giving you today, so that you may continue living and multiply and go in and take possession of the land about which Jehovah swore to your forefathers. 2 Remember the long road that Jehovah your God made you walk these 40 years in the wilderness, to humble you and to put you to the test so as to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. 3 So he humbled you and let you go hungry and fed you with the manna, which neither you had known nor your fathers had known, in order to make you know that man does not live by bread alone but man lives by every expression from Jehovah's mouth. 4 The clothing you wore did not wear out, nor did your feet become swollen these 40 years. 5 You well know in your heart that just as a man corrects his son, Jehovah your God was correcting you.\n6 \"Now you must keep the commandments of Jehovah your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him. 7 For Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of streams of water, springs and fountains flowing in the valley plain and in the mountainous region, 8 a land of wheat and barley, of grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey, 9 a land where food will not be scarce and you will lack nothing, a land where the stones contain iron and from its mountains you will mine copper.\n10 \"When you have eaten and are satisfied, you must praise Jehovah your God for the good land that he has given you. 11 Be careful not to forget Jehovah your God by failing to keep his commandments, his judicial decisions, and his statutes that I am commanding you today. 12 When you eat and are satisfied and you build fine houses and dwell in them, 13 when your herd and your flocks multiply and your silver and gold increase and you have an abundance of everything, 14 do not let your heart become proud and cause you to forget Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, 15 who caused you to walk through the great and fearsome wilderness, with poisonous serpents and scorpions and with parched ground that has no water. He made water flow out of the flinty rock 16 and fed you with manna in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and to put you to the test so as to benefit you in the future. 17 If you should say in your heart, 'My own power and the strength of my own hand have produced this wealth for me,' 18 remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you to make wealth, in order to carry out his covenant that he swore to your forefathers, as it is today.\n19 \"If you should ever forget Jehovah your God and you walk after other gods and serve them and bow down to them, I do bear witness against you today that you will surely perish. 20 Like the nations that Jehovah is destroying before you, that is how you will perish, because you would not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.\nChapter 9\n1 \"Hear, O Israel, today you are crossing the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, cities great and fortified to the heavens, 2 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, about whom you know and have heard it said, 'Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?' 3 Therefore, you should know this day that Jehovah your God will cross ahead of you. He is a consuming fire, and he will annihilate them. He will subdue them before your eyes so that you may quickly drive them out and destroy them, just as Jehovah has promised you.\n4 \"Do not say in your heart when Jehovah your God drives them away from before you, 'It was because of my own righteousness that Jehovah has brought me in to take possession of this land.' Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is driving them away from before you. 5 It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to take possession of their land. Instead, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you and in order to carry out the word that Jehovah swore to your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 6 Know, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that Jehovah your God is giving you this good land to take possession of, because you are an obstinate people.\n7 \"Remember-never forget-the way you provoked Jehovah your God in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until your coming to this place, you have rebelled against Jehovah. 8 Even in Horeb you provoked Jehovah, and Jehovah was so angry with you that he was ready to annihilate you. 9 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that Jehovah made with you, I remained on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights, eating no food and drinking no water. 10 Then Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written on with God's finger, and on them were all the words that Jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire in the day of the assembly. 11 At the end of the 40 days and 40 nights, Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant, 12 and Jehovah told me, 'Get up, go down quickly from here, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the path I commanded them to follow. They have made a metal image for themselves.' 13 Jehovah then said to me, 'I have seen this people, and look! it is an obstinate people. 14 Let me be, and I will annihilate them and wipe out their name from under the heavens, and let me make you a nation mightier and more numerous than they are.'\n15 \"Then I turned and went down the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in both my hands. 16 Then I looked and saw that you had sinned against Jehovah your God! You had made a metal calf for yourselves. You had turned aside quickly from the path Jehovah had commanded you to follow. 17 So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them down with both my hands and shattered them before your eyes. 18 Then I prostrated myself before Jehovah, as at first, for 40 days and 40 nights. I neither ate food nor drank water, because of all the sins that you had committed by your doing what was evil in Jehovah's eyes and offending him. 19 For I was terrified because of Jehovah's great anger against you, in that he was ready to annihilate you. However, Jehovah listened to me that time also.\n20 \"Jehovah was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to annihilate him, but I made supplication for Aaron at that time also. 21 Then I took the sinful thing you made, the calf, and burned it up in the fire; I crushed it and ground it thoroughly until it was fine like dust, and I threw the dust into the stream that flows down from the mountain.\n22 \"Further, at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you also provoked Jehovah to anger. 23 When Jehovah sent you out of Kadesh-barnea and said, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I will certainly give you!' you again rebelled against the order of Jehovah your God, and you did not exercise faith in him and did not obey him. 24 You have rebelled against Jehovah ever since I have known you.\n25 \"So I kept prostrating myself before Jehovah 40 days and 40 nights, for I prostrated myself in this way because Jehovah said he would annihilate you. 26 I began to make supplication to Jehovah and to say, 'O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, do not bring your people to ruin. They are your personal possession, whom you redeemed through your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 27 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not pay attention to the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness, and their sin. 28 Otherwise the people of the land from which you brought us may say: \"Jehovah was unable to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.\" 29 For they are your people and your personal possession, whom you brought out with your great power and your outstretched arm.'\nChapter 10\n1 \"At that time Jehovah said to me, 'Carve out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first ones, and come up to me on the mountain; also you must make for yourself an ark of wood. 2 And I will write on the tablets the words that appeared on the first tablets, which you shattered, and you should place them in the ark.' 3 So I made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two tablets of stone like the first ones and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. 4 Then he wrote on the tablets the words he had written before, the Ten Commandments, which Jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly; and Jehovah gave them to me. 5 Then I turned and went down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark that I had made, where they remain, just as Jehovah had commanded me.\n6 \"The Israelites then departed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan for Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar began to serve as priest in his place. 7 From there they departed for Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah for Jotbathah, a land flowing with streams of water.\n8 \"At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of Jehovah's covenant, to stand before Jehovah in order to minister to him, and to bless in his name, as they do to this day. 9 That is why Levi has not been given a share or an inheritance with his brothers. Jehovah is his inheritance, just as Jehovah your God had said to him. 10 I myself stayed on the mountain as I did the first time, 40 days and 40 nights, and Jehovah listened to me on that occasion also. Jehovah did not want to destroy you. 11 Then Jehovah said to me, 'Go ahead of the people, and prepare to depart, so that they may go in and take possession of the land that I have sworn to their forefathers to give to them.'\n12 \"Now, O Israel, what is Jehovah your God asking of you? Only this: to fear Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul, 13 and to keep the commandments and statutes of Jehovah that I am commanding you today for your own good. 14 Look, to Jehovah your God belong the heavens, even the heavens of the heavens, and the earth with all that is in it. 15 But only to your forefathers did Jehovah draw close and express his love, and he has chosen you, their offspring, out of all the peoples, as you are today. 16 You must now cleanse your hearts and stop being so stubborn. 17 For Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God great, mighty, and awe-inspiring, who treats none with partiality and does not accept a bribe. 18 He executes justice for the fatherless child and the widow and loves the foreign resident, giving him food and clothing. 19 You too must love the foreign resident, for you became foreign residents in the land of Egypt.\n20 \"Jehovah your God you should fear, him you should serve, to him you should cling, and by his name you should swear. 21 He is the One you are to praise. He is your God, who has done all these great and awe-inspiring things for you that your own eyes have seen. 22 With 70 people your forefathers went down into Egypt, and now Jehovah your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the heavens.\nChapter 11\n1 \"You must love Jehovah your God and always keep your obligation to him and his statutes, his judicial decisions, and his commandments. 2 You know that today I am addressing you, not your sons who have not known or seen the discipline of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm. 3 They did not see his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to all his land; 4 or what he did to the armies of Egypt, to Pharaoh's horses and war chariots, which were overwhelmed by the waters of the Red Sea when they were chasing after you, and Jehovah destroyed them once and for all. 5 They did not see what he has done for you in the wilderness until your coming to this place, 6 or what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben, when the earth opened and swallowed them up, along with their households and their tents and every living thing that followed them, before the eyes of all Israel. 7 Your own eyes have seen all the great deeds that Jehovah did.\n8 \"You must keep the whole commandment that I am giving you today, so that you may grow strong and cross over into the land to take possession of it, 9 and so that you may live long in the land that Jehovah swore to give to your forefathers and their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n10 \"The land you are going to take possession of is not like the land of Egypt, out of which you came, where you used to sow your seed and irrigate it with your foot, like a garden of vegetables. 11 But the land you are about to cross into and possess is a land of mountains and valley plains. It drinks the water that rains from the heavens; 12 it is a land that Jehovah your God is caring for. The eyes of Jehovah your God are constantly upon it, from the beginning of the year to the close of the year.\n13 \"And if you will diligently obey my commandments that I am commanding you today and love Jehovah your God and serve him with all your heart and all your soul, 14 I will also give rain for your land at its appointed time, autumn rain and spring rain, and you will gather your grain and your new wine and your oil. 15 And I will provide vegetation in your fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied. 16 Be careful not to let your heart be enticed to go astray and worship other gods and bow down to them. 17 Otherwise, Jehovah's anger will blaze against you, and he will shut up the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will not give its produce and you will quickly perish from the good land that Jehovah is giving you.\n18 \"You must impress these words of mine on your heart and your soul and bind them as a reminder on your hand, and they should be like a headband on your forehead. 19 Teach them to your children, speaking about them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. 20 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, 21 so that you and your sons may live long in the land that Jehovah swore to give to your forefathers, for as long as the heavens are over the earth.\n22 \"If you strictly observe this commandment that I am giving you and you carry it out, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways and to cling to him, 23 Jehovah will drive away all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and more numerous than you are. 24 Every place you set your foot will become yours. From the wilderness up to Lebanon, from the River, the river Euphrates, to the western sea, your boundary will become. 25 Nobody will stand up to you. Jehovah your God will spread the dread and the fear of you over the whole land on which you walk, just as he promised you.\n26 \"See, I am putting before you today a blessing and a curse: 27 the blessing if you obey the commandments of Jehovah your God that I am commanding you today, 28 and the curse if you do not obey the commandments of Jehovah your God and you turn aside from the way I am commanding you to follow today and you follow gods that you have not known.\n29 \"When Jehovah your God brings you into the land you are to possess, you must pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. 30 Are they not on the other side of the Jordan toward the west, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the big trees of Moreh? 31 For you are crossing the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you. When you take possession of it and live in it, 32 you must be careful to carry out all the regulations and the judicial decisions that I am putting before you today.\nChapter 12\n1 \"These are the regulations and the judicial decisions that you should be careful to carry out all the days that you are alive in the land that Jehovah the God of your forefathers will give you to possess. 2 You should completely destroy all the places where the nations you will dispossess have served their gods, whether on the high mountains or on the hills or under any luxuriant tree. 3 You should pull down their altars, shatter their sacred pillars, burn their sacred poles in the fire, and cut down the graven images of their gods, obliterating their very names from that place.\n4 \"You must not worship Jehovah your God in that way. 5 Rather, seek Jehovah your God wherever he chooses to establish his name and his place of residence among all your tribes, and go there. 6 That is where you are to bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution from your hand, your vow offerings, your voluntary offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and flock. 7 You and your households must eat there before Jehovah your God and rejoice in all your undertakings, because Jehovah your God has blessed you.\n8 \"You must not do as we are doing here today, with everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes, 9 because you have not yet come into the resting-place and the inheritance that Jehovah your God is giving you. 10 When you do cross the Jordan and dwell in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess, he will certainly give you rest from all your enemies around you, and you will dwell in security. 11 You will bring all that I am commanding you to the place that Jehovah your God chooses to have his name reside-your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution from your hand, and every vow offering that you vow to Jehovah. 12 You will rejoice before Jehovah your God, you and your sons, your daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levite inside your cities, for he has not been given a share or an inheritance with you. 13 Be careful not to offer up your burnt offerings in any other place you may see. 14 You should offer your burnt offerings only in the place that Jehovah chooses in one of your tribal territories, and there you should do everything I am commanding you.\n15 \"But whenever you desire it, you may slaughter and eat meat, according to the blessing that Jehovah your God has given you in all your cities. The unclean person and the clean person may eat it, as you would eat a gazelle or a deer. 16 But you must not eat the blood; you should pour it out on the ground like water. 17 You will not be allowed to eat within your cities the tenth part of your grain, your new wine, your oil, the firstborn of your herd and flock, any of your vow offerings that you vow, your voluntary offerings, or the contribution from your hand. 18 These you are to eat before Jehovah your God in the place Jehovah your God will choose-you and your son, your daughter, your male and female servant, and the Levite inside your cities; and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God in all your undertakings. 19 Be careful not to neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.\n20 \"When Jehovah your God enlarges your territory, just as he has promised you, and you say, 'I want to eat meat,' because you desire to eat meat, you may eat meat whenever you desire it. 21 If the place that Jehovah your God chooses to put his name is far away from you, you should then slaughter some of your herd or some of your flock that Jehovah has given you, just as I have commanded you, and you should eat inside your cities whenever you desire it. 22 You may eat it as you would eat the gazelle and the deer; both the unclean person and the clean person may eat it. 23 Just be firmly resolved not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the flesh. 24 You must not eat it. You should pour it out on the ground like water. 25 You must not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you are doing what is right in Jehovah's eyes. 26 You should take only the holy things that are yours and your vow offerings when you come to the place that Jehovah will choose. 27 There you will offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Jehovah your God, and the blood of your sacrifices should be poured out against the altar of Jehovah your God, but the flesh you may eat.\n28 \"Be careful to obey all these words that I am commanding you, so that it may always go well with you and your sons after you, because you are doing what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.\n29 \"When Jehovah your God annihilates the nations that you are to dispossess, and you are living in their land, 30 be careful not to be entrapped after they have been annihilated from before you. Do not ask about their gods, saying, 'How were these nations accustomed to serve their gods? I too will do the same.' 31 You must not do this to Jehovah your God, because they do for their gods every detestable thing that Jehovah hates, even burning their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods. 32 Every word that I am commanding you is what you should be careful to do. You must not add to it nor take away from it.\nChapter 13\n1 \"In case a prophet or one who foretells by dreams arises in your midst and gives you a sign or a portent, 2 and the sign or the portent about which he spoke to you comes true while he is saying, 'Let us walk after other gods,' gods that you have not known, 'and let us serve them,' 3 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer, for Jehovah your God is testing you to know whether you love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul. 4 After Jehovah your God you should walk, him you should fear, his commandments you should keep, to his voice you should listen; he is the one you should serve, and to him you should hold fast. 5 But that prophet or that dreamer should be put to death, because he encouraged rebellion against Jehovah your God-who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery-to turn you from the way in which Jehovah your God has commanded you to walk. And you must remove what is evil from your midst.\n6 \"If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or your cherished wife or your closest companion should try to entice you in secrecy, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' gods that neither you nor your forefathers have known, 7 from the gods of the peoples all around you, whether near you or those far away from you, from one end of the land to the other end of the land, 8 you must not give in to him or listen to him, nor should you show pity or feel compassion or protect him; 9 instead, you should kill him without fail. Your hand should be the first to come upon him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward. 10 And you must stone him to death, because he has sought to turn you away from Jehovah your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 11 Then all Israel will hear and become afraid, and they will never again do anything bad like this among you.\n12 \"In case you hear it said in one of your cities that Jehovah your God is giving you to occupy, 13 'Good-for-nothing men have gone out among you to turn away the inhabitants of their city, saying: \"Let us go and serve other gods,\" gods that you have not known,' 14 you should look into the matter, making a thorough investigation and inquiry; and if it is confirmed to be true that this detestable thing has been done among you, 15 you should without fail strike down the inhabitants of that city with the sword. Devote it and everything that is in it, including its livestock, to destruction by the sword. 16 You should then collect all its spoil into the middle of its public square and burn the city with fire, and its spoil will serve as a whole offering to Jehovah your God. It will become a permanent heap of ruins. It should never be rebuilt. 17 Your hand should take nothing that was set apart for destruction, so that Jehovah may turn away from his burning anger and show you mercy and compassion and multiply you, just as he has sworn to your forefathers. 18 For you should obey Jehovah your God by keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, thus doing what is right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.\nChapter 14\n1 \"You are sons of Jehovah your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave your foreheads bald for a dead person. 2 For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God, and Jehovah has chosen you to become his people, his special property, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.\n3 \"You must not eat anything that is detestable. 4 These are the animals that you may eat: the bull, the sheep, the goat, 5 the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the antelope, the wild sheep, and the mountain sheep. 6 You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided into two and that chews the cud. 7 However, you must not eat the following animals that chew the cud or that have split hooves: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not have split hooves. They are unclean for you. 8 Also the pig because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud. It is unclean for you. You must not eat their flesh or touch their carcasses.\n9 \"Of everything that is living in the waters, you may eat these: Anything with fins and scales, you may eat. 10 But you must not eat anything that has no fins and scales. It is unclean for you.\n11 \"You may eat any clean bird. 12 But you must not eat these: the eagle, the osprey, the black vulture, 13 the red kite, the black kite, every kind of glede, 14 every kind of raven, 15 the ostrich, the owl, the gull, every kind of falcon, 16 the little owl, the long-eared owl, the swan, 17 the pelican, the vulture, the cormorant, 18 the stork, every kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat. 19 Every winged swarming creature also is unclean for you. They should not be eaten. 20 Any clean flying creature you may eat.\n21 \"You must not eat any animal that was found dead. You may give it to the foreign resident who is inside your cities, and he may eat it, or it may be sold to a foreigner. For you are a holy people to Jehovah your God.\n\"You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.\n22 \"You must without fail give a tenth of everything your seed produces in the field year by year. 23 You will eat the tenth part of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock before Jehovah your God in the place that he chooses to have his name reside, so that you may learn to fear Jehovah your God always.\n24 \"But if the journey should be too long for you and you are not able to carry it to the place that Jehovah your God chooses as the place for his name because it is far away from you (because Jehovah your God will bless you), 25 you may then convert it into money, and with your money in hand, travel to the place that Jehovah your God will choose. 26 You may then spend the money on whatever you desire-cattle, sheep, goats, wine and other alcoholic beverages, and anything you please; and you will eat there before Jehovah your God and rejoice, you and your household. 27 And do not neglect the Levite who is inside your cities, for he has not been given a share or an inheritance with you.\n28 \"At the end of every three years, you should bring out the entire tenth part of your produce for that year and deposit it inside your cities. 29 Then the Levite, who has not been given a share or an inheritance with you, the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow who are in your cities will come and eat their fill, so that Jehovah your God may bless you in all that you do.\nChapter 15\n1 \"At the end of every seven years, you should grant a release. 2 This is the nature of the release: Every creditor will release his neighbor from the debt he incurred. He should not demand payment from his neighbor or his brother, for it will be proclaimed a release to Jehovah. 3 You may demand payment from the foreigner, but you should release your claim on whatever your brother owes you. 4 However, no one among you should become poor, for Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, 5 but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today. 6 For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you, and you will lend to many nations, but you will not need to borrow; and you will dominate many nations, but they will not dominate you.\n7 \"If one of your brothers becomes poor among you in one of your cities of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, do not harden your heart or be tightfisted toward your poor brother. 8 For you should generously open your hand to him and by all means lend whatever he needs or is lacking. 9 Be careful not to harbor this evil idea in your heart, 'The seventh year, the year of the release, has approached,' and hold back your generosity toward your poor brother and give him nothing. If he calls out to Jehovah against you, it will be a sin on your part. 10 You should generously give to him, and you should not give to him grudgingly, for this is why Jehovah your God will bless your every deed and undertaking. 11 For there will always be poor people in the land. That is why I am commanding you, 'You should generously open up your hand to your afflicted and poor brother in your land.'\n12 \"If one of your brothers, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you and has served you for six years, then in the seventh year you should set him free. 13 And if you should set him free, do not send him away empty-handed. 14 You should supply him generously with something from your flock, your threshing floor, and your press for oil and wine. Just as Jehovah your God has blessed you, you should give to him. 15 Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt and that Jehovah your God redeemed you. That is why I am commanding you to do this today.\n16 \"But if he says to you, 'I will not go out from your company!' because he loves you and your household, since he has been happy while with you, 17 you should then take an awl and put it through his ear into the door, and he will become your slave for life. You should do the same with your slave girl. 18 Do not consider it a hardship when you set him free and he leaves you, because his service to you for six years was worth twice as much as that of a hired worker, and Jehovah your God has blessed you in everything that was done.\n19 \"You should sanctify every firstborn male of your herd and your flock to Jehovah your God. You must not do any work with the firstborn of your herd nor shear the firstborn of your flock. 20 You and your household should eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place that Jehovah will choose. 21 But if it has a defect-lameness, blindness, or any other serious defect-you must not sacrifice it to Jehovah your God. 22 You should eat it inside your cities, the unclean and clean person together, as though it were a gazelle or a deer. 23 But you must not eat its blood; you should pour it out on the ground like water.\nChapter 16\n1 \"Observe the month of Abib, and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God, for in the month of Abib, Jehovah your God brought you out of Egypt by night. 2 And you should sacrifice the Passover offering to Jehovah your God, from the flock and the herd, in the place that Jehovah chooses to have his name reside. 3 You must not eat anything leavened along with it; for seven days you should eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you came out of the land of Egypt in haste. Do this so that you may remember the day you came out of the land of Egypt as long as you live. 4 No sourdough should be found with you in all your territory for seven days, nor should any of the meat that you will sacrifice in the evening on the first day remain all night until the next morning. 5 You will not be allowed to sacrifice the Passover offering in just any of the cities that Jehovah your God is giving you. 6 But it should be done at the place that Jehovah your God chooses to have his name reside. You should sacrifice the Passover offering in the evening as soon as the sun sets, at the appointed time of your coming out of Egypt. 7 You must cook it and eat it in the place that Jehovah your God will choose, and in the morning you may return to your own tents. 8 Six days you should eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there will be a solemn assembly to Jehovah your God. You must do no work.\n9 \"You should count off seven weeks. You should begin counting off seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain. 10 Then you are to celebrate the Festival of Weeks to Jehovah your God with the voluntary offering from your hand, given in proportion to how Jehovah your God blesses you. 11 And you are to rejoice before Jehovah your God, you and your son, your daughter, your male slave, your female slave, the Levite who is inside your cities, the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow, who are in your midst, in the place that Jehovah your God chooses to have his name reside. 12 Remember that you became a slave in Egypt, and observe and carry out these regulations.\n13 \"You should celebrate the Festival of Booths for seven days when you make an ingathering from your threshing floor and from your press for oil and wine. 14 Rejoice during your festival, you and your son, your daughter, your male slave, your female slave, the Levite, the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow, who are inside your cities. 15 Seven days you will celebrate the festival to Jehovah your God in the place that Jehovah chooses, for Jehovah your God will bless all your produce and all that you do, and you will become nothing but joyful.\n16 \"Three times a year, all your males should appear before Jehovah your God in the place that he chooses: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths, and none of them should appear before Jehovah empty-handed. 17 The gift that each one brings should be in proportion to the blessing that Jehovah your God has given you.\n18 \"You should appoint judges and officers for each tribe in all the cities that Jehovah your God is giving you, and they must judge the people with righteous judgment. 19 You must not pervert justice, show partiality, or accept a bribe, for the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and distorts the words of the righteous. 20 Justice-justice you should pursue, so that you may keep living and take possession of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you.\n21 \"You should not plant any sort of tree as a sacred pole near the altar of Jehovah your God that you make for yourself.\n22 \"Neither should you set up a sacred pillar for yourself, something Jehovah your God hates.\nChapter 17\n1 \"You must not sacrifice to Jehovah your God a bull or a sheep that has a defect or anything wrong with it, for it would be detestable to Jehovah your God.\n2 \"Suppose a man or a woman is found among you, in any of your cities that Jehovah your God is giving you, who is practicing what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah your God and violating his covenant, 3 and he goes astray and worships other gods and he bows down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens, a thing that I have not commanded. 4 When it is reported to you or you hear about it, then you should investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is confirmed to be true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, 5 you must bring the man or the woman who has done this evil thing out to the city gates, and the man or the woman must be stoned to death. 6 On the testimony of two witnesses or of three witnesses the one who is to die should be put to death. He must not be put to death on the testimony of one witness. 7 The hand of the witnesses should be the first to come against him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward. You must remove what is bad from your midst.\n8 \"If a case arises in one of your cities that is too difficult for you to judge, whether it is a case involving bloodshed or a legal claim that has been raised or a violent deed that has been committed or other matters of dispute, you should rise up and go to the place that Jehovah your God chooses. 9 Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge serving in those days, and make your inquiry, and they will hand down the decision to you. 10 Then you must act according to the decision that they hand down to you from the place that Jehovah chooses. Be careful to do according to all that they instruct you. 11 You must act according to the law that they show you and according to the decision that they declare to you. Do not deviate from the decision that they will hand down to you, either to the right or to the left. 12 The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who is ministering to Jehovah your God or to the judge must die. You must remove what is bad from Israel. 13 All the people will then hear and become afraid, and they will not act presumptuously anymore.\n14 \"When you enter the land that Jehovah your God is giving you and you have taken possession of it and are living in it, and you say, 'Let me appoint a king over myself like all the nations around me,' 15 in that case, you should without fail appoint a king whom Jehovah your God chooses. You should appoint a king from among your brothers. You are forbidden to appoint over yourself a foreigner who is not your brother. 16 However, he should not acquire many horses for himself or make the people go back to Egypt in order to obtain more horses, since Jehovah told you, 'You must never go back again by this way.' 17 Neither should he take many wives for himself, so that his heart may not go astray; nor should he acquire vast amounts of silver and gold for himself. 18 When he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write for himself in a book a copy of this Law, taken from the one kept by the Levitical priests.\n19 \"It is to remain with him, and he must read from it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God and observe all the words of this Law and these regulations by carrying them out. 20 Thus his heart will not exalt itself above his brothers, and he will not deviate from the commandment, either to the right or to the left, so that he may remain a long time over his kingdom, he and his sons in the midst of Israel.\nChapter 18\n1 \"The Levitical priests, and indeed the entire tribe of Levi, will not be given a share or an inheritance with Israel. They will eat of the offerings made by fire to Jehovah, which are his inheritance. 2 So they should have no inheritance in the midst of their brothers. Jehovah is their inheritance, just as he has spoken to them.\n3 \"Now this will be the due right of the priests from the people: Whoever makes a sacrifice, whether a bull or a sheep, is to give the shoulder, the jaws, and the stomach to the priest. 4 The firstfruits of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first wool that is shorn from your flock you should give him. 5 Jehovah your God has chosen him and his sons from all your tribes to minister in the name of Jehovah always.\n6 \"But if a Levite leaves one of your cities in Israel where he was living and he desires to go to the place that Jehovah chooses, 7 he may minister there in the name of Jehovah his God the same as all his brothers, the Levites, who are stationed there before Jehovah. 8 He will receive an equal share of food with them, in addition to what he receives from selling his ancestral possessions.\n9 \"When you have entered into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the detestable practices of those nations. 10 There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, anyone practicing magic, anyone who looks for omens, a sorcerer, 11 anyone binding others with a spell, anyone who consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller, or anyone who inquires of the dead. 12 For whoever does these things is detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable practices Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you. 13 You should prove yourself blameless before Jehovah your God.\n14 \"For these nations that you are dispossessing used to listen to those practicing magic and divination, but Jehovah your God has not allowed you to do anything like this. 15 Jehovah your God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him. 16 This is in response to what you asked of Jehovah your God in Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, 'Do not let me hear the voice of Jehovah my God or see this great fire anymore, so that I do not die.' 17 Then Jehovah said to me, 'What they have said is good. 18 I will raise up for them from the midst of their brothers a prophet like you, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he will speak to them all that I command him. 19 Indeed, I will require an account from the man who will not listen to my words that he will speak in my name.\n20 \"'If any prophet presumptuously speaks a word in my name that I did not command him to speak or speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die. 21 However, you may say in your heart: \"How will we know that Jehovah has not spoken the word?\" 22 When the prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah and the word is not fulfilled or does not come true, then Jehovah did not speak that word. The prophet spoke it presumptuously. You should not fear him.'\nChapter 19\n1 \"When Jehovah your God destroys the nations whose land Jehovah your God is giving you and you have dispossessed them and have settled in their cities and their houses, 2 you should set apart three cities in the midst of your land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess. 3 You should divide the territory of the land that Jehovah your God has given you to possess into three parts, and prepare the roads so that any manslayer can flee to one of those cities.\n4 \"Now this is what should take place regarding the manslayer who may flee there in order to live: When he strikes his fellow man unintentionally and he did not previously hate him; 5 as when he goes with his fellow man into the forest to gather wood and he raises his hand to cut the tree with the ax, but the axhead flies off the handle and hits his fellow man and he dies, the manslayer should flee to one of these cities to live. 6 Otherwise, in the heat of anger, the avenger of blood may chase after the manslayer, overtake him, and kill him, because the distance to the city was too far. However, he did not deserve to die, since he did not previously hate his fellow man. 7 That is why I am commanding you: 'Set three cities apart.'\n8 \"If Jehovah your God enlarges your territory as he swore to your forefathers and he has given you all the land that he promised to give to your forefathers 9 -provided you faithfully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today, to love Jehovah your God and always to walk in his ways-then you are to add three other cities to these three. 10 In this way no innocent blood will be spilled in your land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, and no bloodguilt will come upon you.\n11 \"But if a man hated his fellow man and he was waiting to attack him and he fatally wounded him and he died, and the man has fled to one of these cities, 12 the elders of his city should then summon him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, and he must die. 13 You should not feel sorry for him, and you must remove the guilt of innocent blood out of Israel, so that it may go well for you.\n14 \"When you receive your inheritance in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess, you must not move your neighbor's boundary marker from the place where the ancestors set the boundaries.\n15 \"No single witness may convict another for any error or any sin that he may commit. On the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses the matter should be established. 16 If a malicious witness testifies against a man and charges him with some transgression, 17 the two men who have the dispute will stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who will be serving in those days. 18 The judges will thoroughly investigate, and if the man who testified is a false witness and has brought a false charge against his brother, 19 you should do to him just as he had schemed to do to his brother, and you must remove what is bad from your midst. 20 Those who remain will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything bad like this among you. 21 You should not feel sorry: Life will be for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\nChapter 20\n1 \"If you go to war against your enemies and you see their horses and chariots and troops that outnumber yours, do not be afraid of them, for Jehovah your God who brought you up out of the land of Egypt is with you. 2 When you are about to go into battle, the priest should approach and address the people. 3 He should tell them, 'Hear, O Israel, you are about to do battle with your enemies. Do not be fainthearted. Do not be afraid or be terrified or tremble because of them, 4 for Jehovah your God is marching with you to fight for you against your enemies and to save you.'\n5 \"The officers too should tell the people, 'Who has built a new house and has not inaugurated it? Let him return to his house. Otherwise, he may die in the battle and another man will inaugurate it. 6 And who has planted a vineyard and not begun to use it? Let him go and return to his house. Otherwise, he may die in the battle and another man will begin to use it. 7 And who has become engaged to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and return to his house. Otherwise, he might die in the battle and another man will marry her.' 8 The officers should also ask the people, 'Who is fearful and fainthearted? He should return to his house, so that he may not cause his brothers to lose heart as he has.' 9 When the officers have finished speaking to the people, they should appoint chiefs of the armies to lead the people.\n10 \"If you approach a city to fight against it, you should also announce to it terms of peace. 11 If it gives a peaceful answer to you and opens up to you, all the people found there will become yours for forced labor, and they will serve you. 12 But if it refuses to make peace with you and instead goes to war with you, you should besiege it, 13 and Jehovah your God will certainly give it into your hand, and you must strike down every male in it with the sword. 14 However, the women, the children, the livestock, and everything that is in the city, all its spoil, you may plunder for yourself, and you will eat the spoil of your enemies, which Jehovah your God has given to you.\n15 \"That is what you will do to all the cities very far away from you that are not of the cities of these nearby nations. 16 But in the cities of these peoples, which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not allow any breathing thing to live. 17 Instead, you should devote them completely to destruction, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, just as Jehovah your God has commanded you; 18 so that they may not teach you to follow all their detestable practices that they have done for their gods, causing you to sin against Jehovah your God.\n19 \"If you lay siege to a city in order to capture it and you have been fighting against it for many days, you should not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them. You may eat from them, but you should not cut them down. For should you besiege a tree of the field as you would a man? 20 You may destroy only a tree that you know is not used for food. You may cut it down and build siegeworks against the city that is making war against you, until it falls.\nChapter 21\n1 \"If someone is found slain in a field of the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him, 2 your elders and judges should go out and measure the distance from the dead body to the cities that surround it. 3 Then the elders of the city nearest to the body should take from the herd a young cow that has never been put to work, that has never pulled in a yoke, 4 and the elders of that city should lead the young cow down to a valley running with water where no tilling or sowing of seed has been done, and they should break the neck of the young cow there in the valley.\n5 \"And the priests, the Levites, will approach because Jehovah your God has chosen them to minister to him, to pronounce blessings in the name of Jehovah. They will declare how every dispute involving violence should be resolved. 6 Then all the elders of the city who are nearest to the dead body should wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken in the valley, 7 and they should declare, 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it shed. 8 Do not hold this against your people Israel, whom you redeemed, O Jehovah, and do not let guilt for innocent blood remain among your people Israel.' Then the bloodguilt will not be held against them. 9 In this way you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from your midst by doing what is right in Jehovah's eyes.\n10 \"If you go to war against your enemies and Jehovah your God defeats them for you and you take them captive, 11 and you see among the captives a beautiful woman and you are attracted to her and you want to take her as your wife, 12 you may bring her into your house. She should then shave her head, attend to her nails, 13 and remove the clothing of her captivity, and dwell in your house. She will weep for her father and her mother a whole month, and afterward you may have relations with her; you will become her husband and she will become your wife. 14 But if you are not pleased with her, you should then let her go wherever she wishes. But you may not sell her for money or treat her harshly, since you have humiliated her.\n15 \"If a man has two wives and he loves one more than the other and both have borne sons to him and the firstborn son belongs to the unloved one, 16 on the day that he gives his inheritance to his sons, he will not be allowed to treat the son of the loved one as his firstborn at the expense of the son of the unloved one, the firstborn. 17 He should recognize as the firstborn the unloved one's son by giving him the double portion of everything he has, for that one is the beginning of his procreative power. The right of the firstborn's position belongs to him.\n18 \"If a man has a son who is stubborn and rebellious and he does not obey his father or his mother, and they have tried to correct him but he refuses to listen to them, 19 his father and his mother should take hold of him and bring him out to the elders at the gate of his city 20 and say to the elders of his city, 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, and he refuses to obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.' 21 Then all the men of his city must stone him to death. So you must remove what is bad from your midst, and all Israel will hear and become afraid.\n22 \"If a man commits a sin deserving the sentence of death and he has been put to death and you have hung him on a stake, 23 his dead body should not remain all night on the stake. Instead, you should be sure to bury him on that day, because the one hung up is something accursed of God, and you should not defile your land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance.\nChapter 22\n1 \"If you see your brother's bull or his sheep going astray, do not deliberately ignore it. You should without fail lead it back to your brother. 2 But if your brother does not live near you or you do not know him, you should bring the animal to your house, and it will remain with you until your brother searches for it. Then you should return it to him. 3 That is what you should do with his donkey, with his clothing, and with anything that your brother has lost and you have found. You must not ignore it.\n4 \"If you see your brother's donkey or his bull fall down on the road, you must not deliberately ignore it. You should without fail help him raise the animal up.\n5 \"A woman must not put on the clothing of a man, nor should a man wear the clothing of a woman. For anyone doing so is detestable to Jehovah your God.\n6 \"If you happen upon a bird's nest along the road with young ones or eggs, whether in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young ones or the eggs, you must not take the mother together with her young. 7 Be sure to send the mother away, but you may take the young for yourself. Do this so that it may go well with you and you may live long.\n8 \"If you build a new house, you must also make a parapet for your roof, so that you may not bring bloodguilt on your house because of someone falling from it.\n9 \"You must not sow your vineyard with two sorts of seed. Otherwise, everything produced from the seed you sow as well as the product of the vineyard will be forfeited to the sanctuary.\n10 \"You must not plow with a bull and a donkey together.\n11 \"You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen mixed together.\n12 \"You should make tassels on the four corners of the clothing you wear.\n13 \"If a man takes a wife and has relations with her but then comes to hate her 14 and he accuses her of misconduct and gives her a bad name by saying: 'I have taken this woman, but when I had relations with her, I did not find evidence that she was a virgin,' 15 the father and mother of the girl should produce the evidence of the girl's virginity for the elders at the gate of the city. 16 The girl's father must say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he hates her 17 and is accusing her of misconduct by saying: \"I have found out that your daughter does not have evidence of virginity.\" Now this is the evidence of my daughter's virginity.' They will then spread out the cloth before the elders of the city. 18 The city elders will take the man and discipline him. 19 They will fine him 100 silver shekels and give them to the girl's father, because the man defamed a virgin of Israel, and she will continue to be his wife. He will not be allowed to divorce her as long as he lives.\n20 \"If, though, the accusation is true, and there is no evidence that the girl was a virgin, 21 they should bring the girl out to the entrance of her father's house, and the men of her city should stone her to death, because she has committed a disgraceful act in Israel by committing sexual immorality in the house of her father. So you must remove what is bad from your midst.\n22 \"If a man is found lying down with a woman who is the wife of another man, both of them must die together, the man who lay down with the woman as well as the woman. So you must remove what is bad out of Israel.\n23 \"If a virgin is engaged to a man, and another man happens to meet her in the city and lies down with her, 24 you should bring them both out to the gate of that city and stone them to death, the girl because she did not scream in the city and the man because he humiliated the wife of his fellow man. So you must remove what is evil from your midst.\n25 \"If, however, the man happened to meet the engaged girl in the field and the man overpowered her and lay down with her, the man who lay down with her is to die by himself, 26 and you must do nothing to the girl. The girl has not committed a sin deserving of death. This case is the same as when a man attacks his fellow man and murders him. 27 For he happened to meet her in the field, and the engaged girl screamed, but there was no one to rescue her.\n28 \"If a man happens to meet a virgin girl who is not engaged and he seizes her and lies down with her and they are discovered, 29 the man who lay down with her must give the girl's father 50 silver shekels, and she will become his wife. Because he humiliated her, he will not be allowed to divorce her as long as he lives.\n30 \"No man should take his father's wife, so that he may not dishonor his father.\nChapter 23\n1 \"No man who has been castrated by having his testicles crushed or who has had his male organ cut off may come into the congregation of Jehovah.\n2 \"No illegitimate son may come into the congregation of Jehovah. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may come into the congregation of Jehovah.\n3 \"No Ammonite or Moabite may come into the congregation of Jehovah. Even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants may ever come into the congregation of Jehovah, 4 because they did not come to your aid with food and water when you were on the way going out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia to curse you. 5 But Jehovah your God refused to listen to Balaam. Rather, Jehovah your God changed the curse into a blessing for you, because Jehovah your God loved you. 6 You should never seek their welfare or their prosperity all your days.\n7 \"You must not hate an Edomite, for he is your brother.\n\"You must not hate an Egyptian, for you became a foreign resident in his country. 8 The third generation of children born to them may enter the congregation of Jehovah.\n9 \"When you are encamped against your enemies, you should avoid anything bad. 10 If a man becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he should go outside the camp and not reenter the camp. 11 When evening falls, he should wash with water, and then he may return to the camp at sunset. 12 A private place should be designated for use outside the camp, and there is where you should go. 13 A peg should be part of your equipment. When you squat outside, you should dig a hole with it and then cover your excrement. 14 For Jehovah your God is walking about within your camp to deliver you and to hand over your enemies to you, and your camp must be holy, so that he does not see anything indecent in you and turn away from accompanying you.\n15 \"You should not hand over a slave to his master when he escapes from his master and comes to you. 16 He may dwell among you in whatever place he chooses in one of your cities, wherever he likes. You must not mistreat him.\n17 \"None of the daughters of Israel may become a temple prostitute, neither may anyone of the sons of Israel become a temple prostitute. 18 You must not bring the price paid to a female prostitute or the price paid to a male prostitute into the house of Jehovah your God to fulfill a vow, for both of them are something detestable to Jehovah your God.\n19 \"You must not make your brother pay interest, whether interest on money, on food, or on anything on which interest may be charged. 20 You may make a foreigner pay interest, but you must not make your brother pay interest, so that Jehovah your God may bless you in every undertaking of yours in the land you are going to take possession of.\n21 \"If you make a vow to Jehovah your God, do not be slow about paying it. For Jehovah your God will surely require it of you; otherwise, it will be a sin on your part. 22 But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty of sin. 23 The word of your lips you should keep, and you must carry out what your own mouth vowed as a voluntary offering to Jehovah your God.\n24 \"If you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat enough grapes to satisfy your appetite, but you should not put any in your container.\n25 \"If you go into your neighbor's field of standing grain, you may pluck the ripe ears with your hand, but you should not put a sickle to your neighbor's grain.\nChapter 24\n1 \"If a man marries a woman but she does not please him because he found something indecent about her, he must write out a certificate of divorce for her, hand it to her, and dismiss her from his house. 2 After she leaves his house, she may go and become another man's wife. 3 If the second man hates her and writes out a certificate of divorce for her, hands it to her, and dismisses her from his house or if the second man who married her should die, 4 her first husband who dismissed her will not be allowed to take her back again as his wife after she has been defiled, for that is something detestable to Jehovah. You must not bring sin into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance.\n5 \"When a man is newly married, he should not serve in the army or be given any other duties. He should remain exempt for one year and stay at home and bring joy to his wife.\n6 \"No one should seize a hand mill or its upper millstone as security for a loan, for that would be taking someone's livelihood as security.\n7 \"If someone is found to have kidnapped one of his Israelite brothers and he has mistreated him and sold him, the kidnapper must die. You should remove what is bad from your midst.\n8 \"When there is an outbreak of leprosy, be very careful to do according to all that the Levitical priests will instruct you. Be careful to do exactly as I commanded them. 9 Remember what Jehovah your God did to Miriam on the way when you were coming out of Egypt.\n10 \"If you make any sort of loan to your neighbor, you must not enter into his house to seize from him what he has offered as security. 11 You should stand outside, and the man who received the loan should bring outside to you what he is giving as security. 12 And if the man is in need, you must not go to bed with what he gave as security still in your possession. 13 You should by all means return to him what he has given as security as soon as the sun sets, and he will go to bed with his garment, and he will bless you; and it will mean righteousness for you before Jehovah your God.\n14 \"You must not defraud a hired worker who is in need and poor, whether one of your brothers or a foreign resident in your land, within your cities. 15 You should give him his wages that very day, before the sun sets, because he is in need and his life depends on his wages. Otherwise, he will cry out to Jehovah against you, and you will be guilty of sin.\n16 \"Fathers should not be put to death for what their children do, and children should not be put to death for what their fathers do. A person should be put to death only for his own sin.\n17 \"You must not pervert the judgment of the foreign resident or of the fatherless child, and you must not seize the garment of a widow as security for a loan. 18 Remember that you became a slave in Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you from there. That is why I am commanding you to do this.\n19 \"When you reap your harvest from your field and you have forgotten a sheaf in the field, do not go back to get it. It should be left for the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow, so that Jehovah your God may bless you in all that you do.\n20 \"When you beat your olive tree, you should not repeat the procedure on its branches. What is left should remain for the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow.\n21 \"When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you must not return to gather the leftovers. They should be left for the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow. 22 Remember that you became a slave in the land of Egypt. That is why I am commanding you to do this.\nChapter 25\n1 \"When a dispute arises between men, they may present themselves before the judges, and they will judge them and pronounce the righteous one innocent and the wicked one guilty. 2 If the wicked one deserves to be beaten, the judge will have him lie down prostrate, and he will be beaten in his presence. The number of strokes should correspond to the wickedness of his deed. 3 He may beat him with up to 40 strokes, but no more. If he would continue beating him with more strokes than this, your brother would be disgraced before your eyes.\n4 \"You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out grain.\n5 \"If brothers dwell together and one of them dies without having a son, the wife of the dead one should not marry someone from outside the family. Her brother-in-law should go to her, take her as his wife, and perform brother-in-law marriage with her. 6 The firstborn whom she will bear will carry on the name of his dead brother, so that his name may not be wiped out of Israel.\n7 \"Now if the man does not want to marry his brother's widow, his brother's widow should then go to the elders at the city gate and say, 'My husband's brother has refused to preserve his brother's name in Israel. He has not consented to perform brother-in-law marriage with me.' 8 The elders of his city must call him and speak to him. Should he insist and say, 'I do not want to marry her,' 9 then his brother's widow should approach him before the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, spit in his face, and say, 'That is what should be done to the man who will not build up his brother's household.' 10 After that his family name in Israel will be known as 'The house of the one who had his sandal removed.'\n11 \"If two men get into a fight with each other and the wife of the one intervenes to protect her husband from the one striking him and she reaches out her hand and grabs hold of him by his private parts, 12 you must amputate her hand. You should not feel sorry.\n13 \"You must not have in your bag two different stone weights, a large one and a small one. 14 You must not have in your house two different measuring containers, a large one and a small one. 15 You should keep an accurate and honest weight and an accurate and honest measure, so that you will live long in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you. 16 For every unjust person who does such things is detestable to Jehovah your God.\n17 \"Remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming out of Egypt, 18 how he met you along the way and attacked all those straggling behind you when you were exhausted and weary. He did not fear God. 19 When Jehovah your God has given you rest from all your enemies around you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, you should wipe out the mention of Amalek from under the heavens. You must not forget.\nChapter 26\n1 \"When eventually you enter into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance and you have taken possession of it and are dwelling in it, 2 you are to take some of the firstfruits of all the produce of the ground, which you will gather from your land that Jehovah your God is giving you, and put them in a basket and go to the place that Jehovah your God chooses to have his name reside. 3 You must go to the priest who will be serving in those days and say to him, 'Today I am reporting to Jehovah your God that I have come into the land that Jehovah swore to our forefathers to give to us.'\n4 \"The priest will then take the basket out of your hand and deposit it before the altar of Jehovah your God. 5 Then you are to declare before Jehovah your God, 'My father was a wandering Aramaean, and he went down to Egypt and resided there as a foreigner, with few in his household. But there he became a great nation, mighty and numerous. 6 And the Egyptians mistreated and oppressed us and imposed harsh slavery on us. 7 So we began to cry out to Jehovah, the God of our forefathers, and Jehovah heard our voice and looked upon our affliction and our trouble and our oppression. 8 Finally Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with terrifying deeds and with signs and miracles. 9 Then he brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10 Now I have brought the firstfruits of the produce of the ground that Jehovah has given me.'\n\"You must deposit it before Jehovah your God and bow down before Jehovah your God. 11 You will then rejoice over all the good that Jehovah your God has given you and your household, you and the Levite and the foreign resident who is among you.\n12 \"When you finish tithing the entire tenth of your produce in the third year, the year of the tenth, you will give it to the Levite, the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow, and they will eat their fill within your cities. 13 You will then say before Jehovah your God, 'I have cleared the holy portion out of my house and given it to the Levite, the foreign resident, the fatherless child, and the widow, just as you have commanded me. I have not violated or neglected your commandments. 14 I have not eaten of it while mourning or removed any of it while unclean or given any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah my God and have done all that you commanded me. 15 Now look down from your holy dwelling, the heavens, and bless your people Israel and the land that you have given us, just as you swore to our forefathers, the land flowing with milk and honey.'\n16 \"This day Jehovah your God is commanding you to carry out these regulations and judicial decisions. You must observe them and carry them out with all your heart and all your soul. 17 Today you have obtained Jehovah's declaration that he will become your God as you walk in his ways and observe his regulations, his commandments, and his judicial decisions, and as you listen to his voice. 18 And today Jehovah has obtained your declaration that you will become his people, his special property, just as he has promised you, and that you will observe all his commandments 19 and that he will put you high above all the other nations that he has made, giving you praise and fame and glory as you prove yourself a people holy to Jehovah your God, just as he has promised.\"\nChapter 27\n1 Then Moses together with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying: \"Observe every commandment that I am giving you today. 2 And in the day when you will cross the Jordan into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, set up large stones and cover them with plaster. 3 Then write on them all the words of this Law when you have crossed over, so that you may enter into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, has promised you. 4 When you have crossed the Jordan, you should set up these stones on Mount Ebal and cover them with plaster, just as I am commanding you today. 5 You are also to build an altar there to Jehovah your God, an altar of stones. You should not use iron tools on them. 6 You should build the altar of Jehovah your God with whole stones and offer burnt offerings to Jehovah your God on it. 7 You are to offer communion sacrifices and eat them there, and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God. 8 And clearly write on the stones all the words of this Law.\"\n9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying: \"Keep silent and listen, O Israel. This day you have become the people of Jehovah your God. 10 You must listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and carry out his commandments and his regulations, which I am commanding you today.\"\n11 On that day Moses commanded the people, saying: 12 \"The following tribes will stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have crossed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 13 And the following will stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 14 And the Levites will answer every man of Israel with a loud voice:\n15 \"'Cursed is the man who makes a carved image or a metal statue, a thing detestable to Jehovah, the workmanship of the hands of a craftsman, and who has hidden it.'

(And all the people will say, 'Amen!')\nChapter 28\n1 \"And if you will without fail listen to the voice of Jehovah your God by being careful to do all his commandments that I am commanding you today, Jehovah your God will certainly put you high above all other nations of the earth. 2 All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you, because you keep listening to the voice of Jehovah your God:\n3 \"Blessed you will be in the city, and blessed you will be in the field.\n4 \"Blessed will be your children and the fruit of your ground and the offspring of your livestock, your young cattle and sheep.\n5 \"Blessed will be your basket and your kneading bowl.\n6 \"Blessed you will be when you come in, and blessed you will be when you go out.\n7 \"Jehovah will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you. They will attack you from one direction, but they will flee from you in seven different directions. 8 Jehovah will decree for you a blessing on your storehouses and every undertaking of yours, and he will certainly bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you. 9 Jehovah will establish you as a holy people to himself, just as he swore to you, because you continue to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God and walk in his ways. 10 All the peoples of the earth will have to see that Jehovah's name has been called upon you, and they will be afraid of you.\n11 \"Jehovah will make you overflow with many children and much livestock and fruitful ground in the land that Jehovah swore to your forefathers to give you. 12 Jehovah will open up to you his good storehouse, the heavens, to give your land rain in its season and to bless all that you do. You will lend to many nations, while you yourself will not need to borrow. 13 Jehovah will make you the head, and not the tail; and you will be on top, and not on the bottom, if you keep obeying the commandments of Jehovah your God that I am commanding you today to observe and to do. 14 You must not deviate from all the words that I am commanding you today, to the right or to the left, to walk after other gods to serve them.\n15 \"But if you will not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God by taking care to do all his commandments and his statutes that I am commanding you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:\n16 \"Cursed you will be in the city, and cursed you will be in the field.\n17 \"Cursed will be your basket and your kneading bowl.\n18 \"Cursed will be your children and the fruit of your ground and your young cattle and sheep.\n19 \"Cursed you will be when you come in, and cursed you will be when you go out.\n20 \"Jehovah will send upon you the curse, confusion and punishment in every undertaking of yours until you have been annihilated and have quickly perished, because of your bad practices and your forsaking me. 21 Jehovah will cause the disease to cling to you until he has exterminated you from the land you are going to take possession of. 22 Jehovah will strike you with tuberculosis, burning fever, inflammation, feverish heat, the sword, scorching blight, and mildew; and they will pursue you until you have perished. 23 The skies over your head will be copper, and the earth beneath you, iron. 24 Jehovah will make the rain of your land powder and dust that will come down on you from the heavens until you have been annihilated. 25 Jehovah will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will attack them from one direction, but you will flee from them in seven different directions; and you will become an object of horror to all the earth's kingdoms. 26 And your carcasses will become food for every bird of the sky and animal of the ground, with no one to frighten them away.\n27 \"Jehovah will strike you with the boils of Egypt, piles, eczema, and skin lesions, from which you cannot be healed. 28 Jehovah will strike you with madness and blindness and confusion. 29 You will grope about at midday, just as a blind man gropes about in darkness, and you will not succeed in anything you do; and you will be constantly defrauded and robbed, with no one to save you. 30 You will become engaged to a woman, but another man will rape her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not begin to use it. 31 Your bull will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be stolen right in front of you, but it will not return to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, but you will have no savior. 32 Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people while you look on, and you will always long for them, but your hands will be powerless. 33 The fruitage of your ground and all that you produce will be eaten by a people whom you have not known, and you will always be defrauded and crushed. 34 You will be driven mad by what your eyes see.\n35 \"Jehovah will strike you with painful and incurable boils on your knees and legs, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. 36 Jehovah will drive you and the king whom you set up over yourself to a nation that you and your forefathers have not known, and there you will serve other gods, gods of wood and of stone. 37 And you will become an object of horror and of scorn, and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples to whom Jehovah drives you.\n38 \"You will take much seed out into the field, but you will gather little, because the locust will devour it. 39 Vineyards you will plant and cultivate, but you will drink no wine and gather nothing, because the worm will consume it. 40 You will have olive trees in all your territory, but you will rub no oil on yourself, because your olives will drop off. 41 Sons and daughters you will bear, but they will not remain yours, because they will go off into captivity. 42 Swarms of insects will overwhelm all your trees and the fruitage of your ground. 43 The foreign resident who is in your midst will keep ascending higher and higher over you, while you yourself will keep descending lower and lower. 44 He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will become the head, while you yourself will become the tail.\n45 \"All these curses will certainly come upon you and pursue you and overtake you until you have been annihilated, because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God by keeping his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you. 46 And they will continue on you and your offspring as a permanent sign and portent, 47 because you did not serve Jehovah your God with rejoicing and joy of heart when you had such an abundance of everything. 48 Jehovah will send your enemies against you, and you will serve them while you are hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and lacking everything. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has annihilated you.\n49 \"Jehovah will raise up against you a distant nation, from the end of the earth; it will pounce like an eagle, a nation whose language you will not understand, 50 a nation fierce in appearance that will show no regard to the old or favor to the young. 51 They will eat the offspring of your livestock and the fruitage of your ground until you have been annihilated. They will not leave any grain, new wine or oil, young cattle or sheep for you until they have destroyed you. 52 They will besiege you, shutting you up inside all your cities throughout your land until your high and fortified walls that you are trusting in fall down. Yes, they will certainly besiege you within all your cities throughout your land that Jehovah your God has given you. 53 Then you will have to eat your own children, the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom Jehovah your God has given you, because of the severity of the siege and the distress your enemy inflicts on you.\n54 \"Even the most delicate and sensitive man among you will have no pity on his brother or his cherished wife or his sons who remain, 55 and he will not share with them any of the flesh of his sons that he will eat, because he has nothing else on account of the severity of the siege and the distress your enemy inflicts on your cities. 56 And the delicate and sensitive woman among you who would not even think of putting the sole of her foot on the ground because she is so delicate will show no pity to her cherished husband or her son or her daughter, 57 even toward the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and toward the sons she bears, for she will secretly eat them because of the severity of the siege and the distress your enemy inflicts on your cities.\n58 \"If you will not carefully observe all the words of this Law that are written in this book and you do not fear this glorious and awe-inspiring name, that of Jehovah your God, 59 Jehovah will inflict very severe plagues on you and your offspring, great and enduring plagues, and grievous and enduring sicknesses. 60 He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you used to fear, and they will certainly cling to you. 61 Moreover, Jehovah will even bring upon you every sickness or plague not written in the book of this Law until you have been annihilated. 62 Although you have become as numerous as the stars of the heavens, very few of your number will be left, because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.\n63 \"And just as Jehovah once delighted to make you prosper and to multiply you, so Jehovah will delight to destroy you and to annihilate you; and you will be torn from the land you are about to possess.\n64 \"Jehovah will scatter you among all the nations, from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, and there you will have to serve gods of wood and of stone, which you and your forefathers have not known. 65 You will have no peace among those nations nor a place of rest for the sole of your foot. Rather, Jehovah will give you there an anxious heart and failing eyes and a feeling of despair. 66 Your life will be in great peril, and you will feel dread night and day; and you will be uncertain of your survival. 67 In the morning you will say, 'If only it were evening!' and in the evening you will say, 'If only it were morning!' because of the dread you will feel in your heart and because of what your eyes will see. 68 And Jehovah will certainly bring you back to Egypt by ship, by the way that I told you, 'You will never see it again,' and there you will have to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.\"\nChapter 29\n1 These are the words of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant that he made with them at Horeb.\n2 Moses then called together all Israel and said to them: \"You have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land, 3 the great judgments that your eyes saw, those great signs and miracles. 4 But Jehovah has not given you a heart to understand and eyes to see and ears to hear, down to this day. 5 'While I kept guiding you for 40 years in the wilderness, your garments did not wear out on you and your sandals did not wear out on your feet. 6 You did not eat bread, and you did not drink wine or anything alcoholic, so that you would know that I am Jehovah your God.' 7 You eventually came to this place, and Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us in battle, but we defeated them. 8 After that we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of the Manassites. 9 Therefore, observe the words of this covenant and obey them, so that everything you do will turn out well.\n10 \"All of you are stationed today before Jehovah your God, the heads of your tribes, your elders, your officers, every man of Israel, 11 your children, your wives, and your foreign resident who is in the midst of your camp, from the one gathering your wood to the one drawing your water. 12 You are here in order to enter into the covenant of Jehovah your God and his oath, which Jehovah your God is making with you today 13 in order that he may establish you today as his people and that he may be your God, just as he has promised you and just as he swore to your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n14 \"Now it is not with you alone that I am making this covenant and this oath, 15 but it is with those standing here with us today before Jehovah our God and with those who are not here with us today. 16 (For you well know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the midst of various nations on our journey. 17 And you used to see their detestable things and their disgusting idols of wood and stone, silver and gold, that were among them.) 18 Beware that there may not be a man or a woman, a family or a tribe among you today whose heart turns away from Jehovah our God to go serve the gods of those nations, that there may not be a root among you producing poisonous fruit and wormwood.\n19 \"But if someone hears the words of this oath and boasts in his heart, saying, 'I will have peace, though I insist on walking in the ways of my own heart,' to the ruin of everything in his path, 20 Jehovah will not be willing to forgive him. Instead, Jehovah's great anger will blaze against that man, and the entire curse written in this book will certainly come upon him, and Jehovah will indeed wipe out his name from under the heavens. 21 Jehovah will then single him out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity in accord with the entire curse of the covenant that is written in this book of the Law.\n22 \"When the future generation of your sons and the foreigner from a distant land see the plagues of the land, the maladies that Jehovah has brought upon it- 23 sulfur and salt and burning, so that its whole land will not be sown or sprout, nor will any vegetation spring up in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath- 24 they and all the nations will say, 'Why did Jehovah do this to this land? What caused this great, burning anger?' 25 Then they will say, 'It was because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their forefathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 26 But they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that he had not permitted them to worship. 27 Then Jehovah's burning anger came against that land by bringing upon it the entire curse written in this book. 28 Therefore, Jehovah uprooted them from their soil in his anger and fury and great indignation and deported them to another land, where they are today.'\n29 \"The things concealed belong to Jehovah our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our descendants forever, so that we may carry out all the words of this Law.\nChapter 30\n1 \"When all these words come upon you, the blessing and the curse that I have put before you, and you call them to mind in all the nations where Jehovah your God has dispersed you, 2 and you return to Jehovah your God and listen to his voice according to all that I am commanding you today, you and your sons, with all your heart and all your soul, 3 Jehovah your God will then bring back your captives and show you mercy and regather you from all the peoples where Jehovah your God has scattered you. 4 Even if your people are dispersed to the extremity of the heavens, from there Jehovah your God will gather you and bring you back. 5 Jehovah your God will bring you into the land your fathers took possession of, and you will possess it; and he will make you prosper and will multiply you more than your fathers. 6 Jehovah your God will cleanse your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and you may live. 7 Then Jehovah your God will bring all these curses upon your enemies, who hated and persecuted you.\n8 \"You will then return and listen to the voice of Jehovah and observe all his commandments that I am commanding you today. 9 Jehovah your God will make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hands, multiplying your children and your livestock and the produce of your ground, for Jehovah will again delight to make you prosper, just as he delighted in your forefathers. 10 For then you will listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and keep his commandments and statutes written in this book of the Law, and you will return to Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul.\n11 \"Now this commandment that I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it beyond your reach. 12 It is not in the heavens, so that you have to say, 'Who will ascend to the heavens and get it for us, so that we may hear it and observe it?' 13 Nor is it on the other side of the sea, so that you have to say, 'Who will cross over to the other side of the sea and get it for us, so that we may hear it and observe it?' 14 For the word is very near you, in your own mouth and in your own heart, so that you may do it.\n15 \"See, I do put before you today life and good, and death and bad. 16 If you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God that I am commanding you today, by loving Jehovah your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his judicial decisions, then you will live and multiply, and Jehovah your God will bless you in the land you are going to possess.\n17 \"But if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are enticed and bow down to other gods and serve them, 18 I tell you today that you will certainly perish. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess. 19 I take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that I have put life and death before you, the blessing and the curse; and you must choose life so that you may live, you and your descendants, 20 by loving Jehovah your God, by listening to his voice, and by sticking to him, for he is your life and by him you will endure a long time in the land that Jehovah swore to give to your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\"\nChapter 31\n1 Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel, 2 saying to them: \"I am 120 years old today. I can no longer lead you, for Jehovah has said to me, 'You will not cross this Jordan.' 3 Jehovah your God is the one crossing before you, and he himself will annihilate these nations before you, and you will drive them away. Joshua is the one who will lead you across, just as Jehovah has spoken. 4 Jehovah will do to them just as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land when he annihilated them. 5 Jehovah will defeat them for you, and you are to do to them according to the whole commandment that I have given you. 6 Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or struck with terror before them, for Jehovah your God is the one marching with you. He will neither desert you nor abandon you.\"\n7 Moses then called Joshua and said to him before the eyes of all Israel: \"Be courageous and strong, for you are the one who will bring this people into the land that Jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance. 8 Jehovah is the one marching before you, and he will continue with you. He will neither desert you nor abandon you. Do not be afraid or be terrified.\"\n9 Then Moses wrote this Law and gave it to the priests, the Levites, who carry the ark of Jehovah's covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. 10 Moses commanded them, saying: \"At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of the release, during the Festival of Booths, 11 when all Israel appears before the presence of Jehovah your God in the place that he chooses, you should read this Law for all Israel to hear it. 12 Gather the people together, the men, the women, the children, and your foreign resident who is within your cities, in order that they may listen and learn about and fear Jehovah your God and take care to carry out all the words of this Law. 13 Then their sons who have not known this Law will listen and learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days that you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.\"\n14 Jehovah then said to Moses: \"Look! The time has drawn near for you to die. Call Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, so that I may commission him.\" So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting. 15 Then Jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood by the entrance of the tent.\n16 Jehovah now said to Moses: \"Look! You are about to die, and this people will begin to commit spiritual prostitution with the foreign gods that are around them in the land to which they are going. They will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them. 17 At that time my anger will blaze against them, and I will forsake them and hide my face from them until they are devoured. Then after many calamities and distresses have come upon them, they will say, 'Is it not because our God is not in our midst that these calamities have come upon us?' 18 But I will keep my face hidden in that day because of all the wickedness that they have done in turning to other gods.\n19 \"Now write down this song for yourselves and teach it to the Israelites. Have them learn it in order that this song may serve as my witness against the people of Israel. 20 When I bring them to the land that I have sworn about to their forefathers-one flowing with milk and honey-and they eat their fill and prosper, they will turn to other gods and serve them and treat me with disrespect and break my covenant. 21 When many calamities and distresses come upon them, this song will serve as a witness to them (for their descendants should not forget it), for I already know the inclination that they have developed even before I bring them into the land about which I have sworn.\"\n22 So Moses wrote down this song in that day and taught it to the Israelites.\n23 He then commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said: \"Be courageous and strong, for you are the one who will bring the Israelites into the land about which I have sworn to them, and I will continue with you.\"\n24 As soon as Moses had completed writing the words of this Law in a book in their entirety, 25 Moses commanded the Levites who carry the ark of Jehovah's covenant, saying: 26 \"Take this book of the Law and place it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it will serve as a witness there against you. 27 For I myself well know your rebelliousness and your stubbornness. If you have been so rebellious against Jehovah while I am still alive with you, then how much more so will you be after my death! 28 Gather together to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, and let me speak these words in their hearing, and let me take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against them. 29 For I well know that after my death you will surely act wickedly and turn aside from the way about which I have commanded you. And calamity will certainly befall you at the close of the days, because you will do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah and you will offend him by the works of your hands.\"\n30 Then in the hearing of the entire congregation of Israel, Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end:\nChapter 32\n1 \"Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak,\nAnd let the earth hear the words of my mouth.\n2 My instruction will fall as the rain;\nMy words will trickle as the dew,\nAs gentle rains upon grass\nAnd as copious showers upon vegetation.\n3 For I will declare the name of Jehovah.\nTell about the greatness of our God!\n4 The Rock, perfect is his activity,\nFor all his ways are justice.\nA God of faithfulness who is never unjust;\nRighteous and upright is he.\n5 They are the ones who have acted corruptly.\nThey are not his children, the defect is their own.\nThey are a crooked and twisted generation!\n6 Is this the way that you should treat Jehovah,\nO foolish and unwise people?\nIs he not your Father who caused your existence,\nThe One who made you and firmly established you?\n7 Remember the days of old;\nConsider the years of past generations.\nAsk your father, and he can tell you;\nYour elders, and they will inform you.\n8 When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,\nWhen he divided the sons of Adam from one another,\nHe fixed the boundary of the peoples\nWith regard for the number of the sons of Israel.\n9 For Jehovah's people are his portion;\nJacob is his inheritance.\n10 He found him in a wilderness land\nAnd in an empty, howling desert.\nHe protectively encircled him, took care of him,\nAnd safeguarded him as the pupil of his eye.\n11 Just as an eagle stirs up its nest,\nHovers over its fledglings,\nSpreading out its wings, taking them,\nCarrying them on its pinions,\n12 Jehovah alone kept leading him;\nNo foreign god was with him.\n13 He made him ride upon earth's high places,\nSo that he ate the produce of the field.\nHe nourished him with honey from the crag\nAnd oil out of a flinty rock,\n14 Butter of the herd and milk of the flock,\nTogether with the choicest sheep,\nAnd rams of Bashan, and he-goats,\nTogether with the finest wheat;\nAnd you drank wine from the blood of grapes.\n15 When Jeshurun grew fat, he kicked out rebelliously.\nYou have grown fat, you have become stout, you have become bloated.\nSo he forsook God, who made him,\nAnd despised the Rock of his salvation.\n16 They incited him to fury with foreign gods;\nThey were offending him with detestable things.\n17 They were sacrificing to demons, not to God,\nTo gods that they had not known,\nNew ones that came along recently,\nTo gods that your forefathers did not know.\n18 You forgot the Rock who fathered you,\nAnd you did not remember the God who gave birth to you.\n19 When Jehovah saw it, he rejected them\nBecause his sons and his daughters offended him.\n20 So he said, 'I will hide my face from them;\nI will see what will become of them.\nFor they are a perverse generation,\nSons in whom there is no faithfulness.\n21 They have incited me to fury with what is not a god;\nThey have offended me with their worthless idols.\nSo I will incite them to jealousy with what is not a people;\nI will offend them with a foolish nation.\n22 For my anger has kindled a fire\nThat will burn to the depths of the Grave,\nAnd it will consume the earth and its produce\nAnd will set ablaze the foundations of mountains.\n23 I will increase their calamities;\nI will use up my arrows on them.\n24 They will be exhausted from hunger\nAnd eaten up by burning fever and bitter destruction.\nI will send the teeth of beasts against them\nAnd the venom of reptiles of the dust.\n25 Outside, a sword will bereave them;\nInside, there is terror\nFor both young man and virgin,\nInfant together with gray-haired man.\n26 I would have said: \"I will scatter them;\nI will make the memory of them cease from among men,\"\n27 If not for my dread of the enemy's reaction,\nBecause the adversaries might misconstrue it.\nThey might say: \"Our power has triumphed;\nIt was not Jehovah who did all of this.\"\n28 For they are a nation devoid of sense,\nAnd there is no understanding among them.\n29 If only they were wise! They would ponder over this.\nThey would think about their outcome.\n30 How could one chase after 1,000,\nAnd two put 10,000 to flight?\nNot unless their Rock had sold them\nAnd Jehovah had surrendered them.\n31 For their rock is not like our Rock,\nEven our enemies have understood this.\n32 For their vine is from the vine of Sodom\nAnd from the terraces of Gomorrah.\nTheir grapes are grapes of poison,\nTheir clusters are bitter.\n33 Their wine is the venom of serpents,\nThe cruel poison of cobras.\n34 Is this not stored up with me,\nSealed up in my storehouse?\n35 Vengeance is mine, and retribution,\nAt the appointed time when their foot slips,\nFor the day of their disaster is near,\nAnd what awaits them will come quickly.'\n36 For Jehovah will judge his people,\nAnd he will feel pity for his servants\nWhen he sees that their strength has waned,\nAnd that only the helpless and weak remain.\n37 Then he will say, 'Where are their gods,\nThe rock in whom they sought refuge,\n38 Who used to eat the fat of their sacrifices,\nTo drink the wine of their drink offerings?\nLet them rise up and help you.\nLet them become your place of refuge.\n39 See now that I-I am he,\nAnd there are no gods apart from me.\nI put to death, and I make alive.\nI wound, and I will heal,\nAnd no one can rescue from my hand.\n40 For I raise my hand to heaven,\nAnd I swear: \"As surely as I live forever,\"\n41 If I sharpen my flashing sword\nAnd prepare my hand for judgment,\nI will pay back vengeance on my adversaries\nAnd bring retribution to those who hate me.\n42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood,\nAnd my sword will eat flesh,\nWith the blood of the slain and the captives,\nWith the heads of the leaders of the enemy.'\n43 Be glad, you nations, with his people,\nFor he will avenge the blood of his servants,\nAnd he will repay vengeance to his adversaries\nAnd will make atonement for the land of his people.\"\n44 Thus Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun. 45 After Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 46 he said to them: \"Take to heart all the words of my warning to you today, so that you may command your sons to take care to do all the words of this Law. 47 For this is no empty word for you, but it means your life, and by this word you may live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.\"\n48 Jehovah spoke to Moses on this same day, saying: 49 \"Go up into this mountain of Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, which faces toward Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as a possession. 50 Then you will die on the mountain you are about to ascend, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people, 51 because both of you were unfaithful to me among the Israelites at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not sanctify me before the people of Israel. 52 You will see the land from a distance, but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.\"\nChapter 33\n1 Now this is the blessing that Moses the man of the true God pronounced on the Israelites before his death. 2 He said:\n\"Jehovah-from Sinai he came,\nAnd he shone upon them from Seir.\nHe shone forth in glory from the mountainous region of Paran,\nAnd with him were holy myriads,\nAt his right hand his warriors.\n3 He had affection for his people;\nAll their holy ones are in your hand.\nThey were sitting at your feet;\nThey began to listen to your words.\n4 (Moses gave us a command, a law,\nAs a possession of the congregation of Jacob.)\n5 And He became king in Jeshurun,\nWhen the heads of the people gathered together,\nAlong with all the tribes of Israel.\n6 Let Reuben live and not die off,\nAnd may his men not become few.\"\n7 And he pronounced this blessing on Judah:\n\"Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah,\nAnd may you bring him back to his people.\nHis arms have defended what belongs to him,\nAnd may you help him against his adversaries.\"\n8 Of Levi he said:\n\"Your Thummim and your Urim belong to the man loyal to you,\nWhom you put to the test at Massah.\nYou began to contend with him by the waters of Meribah,\n9 The man who said to his father and his mother, 'I have not shown regard to them.'\nEven his brothers he did not acknowledge,\nAnd he ignored his own sons.\nFor they kept your word,\nAnd they observed your covenant.\n10 Let them instruct Jacob in your judicial decisions\nAnd Israel in your Law.\nLet them offer up incense as a pleasant aroma for you\nAnd a whole offering on your altar.\n11 Bless, O Jehovah, his strength,\nAnd may you show pleasure in the work of his hands.\nCrush the legs of those who rise up against him,\nSo that those who hate him may rise up no more.\"\n12 Of Benjamin he said:\n\"Let the beloved one of Jehovah reside in security by him;\nWhile he shelters him the whole day,\nHe will reside between his shoulders.\"\n13 Of Joseph he said:\n\"May his land be blessed by Jehovah\nWith the choice things of heaven,\nWith dew and the waters from the springs below,\n14 With choice things produced by the sun\nAnd the choice yield each month,\n15 With the choicest things from the ancient mountains\nAnd choice things of the enduring hills,\n16 With the choice things of the earth and what fills it,\nAnd with the approval of the One residing in the thornbush.\nMay they come upon the head of Joseph,\nOn the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers.\n17 His splendor is like that of a firstborn bull,\nAnd his horns are the horns of a wild bull.\nWith them he will push peoples\nAll together to the ends of the earth.\nThey are the tens of thousands of Ephraim,\nAnd they are the thousands of Manasseh.\"\n18 Of Zebulun he said:\n\"Rejoice, O Zebulun, in your going out,\nAnd you, Issachar, in your tents.\n19 They will call peoples to the mountain.\nThere they will offer the sacrifices of righteousness.\nFor they will draw from the abundant wealth of the seas\nAnd the hidden hoards of the sand.\"\n20 Of Gad he said:\n\"Blessed is the one widening the borders of Gad.\nHe lies there like a lion,\nReady to tear off the arm, yes, the crown of the head.\n21 He will select the first portion for himself,\nFor there the allotment of a lawgiver is reserved.\nThe heads of the people will gather together.\nThe righteousness of Jehovah he will execute,\nAnd his judicial decisions with Israel.\"\n22 Of Dan he said:\n\"Dan is a lion cub.\nHe will leap out from Bashan.\"\n23 Of Naphtali he said:\n\"Naphtali is satisfied with the approval\nAnd full of the blessing of Jehovah.\nTake possession of the west and south.\"\n24 Of Asher he said:\n\"Blessed with sons is Asher.\nMay he be favored by his brothers,\nAnd may he dip his feet in oil.\n25 Iron and copper are your gate locks,\nAnd you will be secure all your days.\n26 There is none like the true God of Jeshurun,\nWho rides through heaven to help you\nAnd who rides upon the clouds in his majesty.\n27 God is a refuge from ancient times,\nHis everlasting arms are beneath you.\nAnd he will drive away the enemy from before you,\nAnd he will say, 'Annihilate them!'\n28 Israel will reside in security,\nAnd the fountain of Jacob will be secluded\nIn a land of grain and new wine,\nWhose skies will drip with dew.\n29 Happy you are, O Israel!\nWho is there like you,\nA people enjoying salvation in Jehovah,\nYour protective shield\nAnd your majestic sword?\nYour enemies will cringe before you,\nAnd you will tread on their backs.\"\nChapter 34\n1 Then Moses went up from the desert plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land, from Gilead to Dan, 2 and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, 3 and the Negeb and the District, the valley plain of Jericho, the city of the palm trees, as far as Zoar.\n4 Jehovah then said to him: \"This is the land about which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.' I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over there.\"\n5 After that Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab just as Jehovah had said. 6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, and nobody knows where his grave is down to this day. 7 Moses was 120 years old at his death. His eyes had not grown dim, and his strength had not departed. 8 The people of Israel wept for Moses on the desert plains of Moab for 30 days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.\n9 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand on him; and the Israelites began to listen to him, and they did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 10 But there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face-to-face. 11 He performed all the signs and the miracles that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land, 12 along with the mighty hand and the awesome power that Moses displayed before the eyes of all Israel.\n",

    "text": "First Samuel\nChapter 1\n1 Now there was a man of Ramathaim-zophim of the mountainous region of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 2 He had two wives; one was named Hannah, and the other was named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 3 That man went up from his city year after year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of armies in Shiloh. That is where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, served as priests to Jehovah.\n4 One day when Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he gave portions to his wife Peninnah as well as to all her sons and her daughters, 5 but to Hannah he gave a special portion, because Hannah was the one he loved; but Jehovah had not given her children. 6 Moreover, her rival wife taunted her relentlessly in order to upset her because Jehovah had not given her children. 7 That is what she would do year after year; whenever Hannah went up to the house of Jehovah, her rival would taunt her so much that she would weep and not eat. 8 But her husband Elkanah said to her: \"Hannah, why do you weep, and why do you not eat, and why are you so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?\"\n9 Then Hannah got up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. At the time, Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah. 10 Hannah was extremely bitter, and she began to pray to Jehovah and to weep uncontrollably. 11 And she made this vow: \"O Jehovah of armies, if you look upon the affliction of your servant and remember me and you do not forget your servant and give to your servant a male child, I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor will touch his head.\"\n12 While she prayed for a long time before Jehovah, Eli was watching her mouth. 13 Hannah was speaking in her heart, only her lips were trembling, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk. 14 Eli said to her: \"How long will you stay drunk? Stop drinking your wine.\" 15 At this Hannah answered: \"No, my lord! I am a woman under great stress; I have not drunk wine or anything alcoholic, but I am pouring out my soul before Jehovah. 16 Do not take your servant for a worthless woman, for I have been speaking until now out of my great anguish and distress.\" 17 Then Eli answered: \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.\" 18 To this she said: \"Let your servant find favor in your eyes.\" And the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer downcast.\n19 Then they got up early in the morning and bowed before Jehovah, after which they returned to their house in Ramah. Elkanah had sexual relations with his wife Hannah, and Jehovah gave attention to her. 20 Within a year Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and named him Samuel, because, as she said, \"it is from Jehovah that I have asked him.\"\n21 In time Elkanah went up with all his household to offer the yearly sacrifice to Jehovah and to present his vow offering. 22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband: \"As soon as the boy is weaned, I will bring him; then he will appear before Jehovah and remain there from then on.\" 23 Elkanah her husband then said to her: \"Do what you think is best. Stay at home until you wean him. May Jehovah carry out what you have said.\" So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she weaned him.\n24 As soon as she had weaned him, she took him up to Shiloh, along with a three year old bull, one ephah of flour, and a large jar of wine, and she came to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh and brought the young boy with her. 25 Then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli. 26 With that she said: \"Pardon me, my lord! As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing with you in this place to pray to Jehovah. 27 It was for this boy that I prayed, and Jehovah granted my petition that I asked of him. 28 I, in turn, now lend him to Jehovah. For all his days, he is lent to Jehovah.\"\nAnd he bowed down there to Jehovah.\nChapter 2\n1 Then Hannah said in prayer:\n\"My heart rejoices in Jehovah;\nMy horn is exalted by Jehovah.\nMy mouth is opened wide against my enemies,\nFor I rejoice in your acts of salvation.\n2 There is no one holy like Jehovah,\nThere is no one but you,\nAnd there is no rock like our God.\n3 Do not keep speaking with haughtiness;\nLet nothing arrogant come from your mouth,\nFor Jehovah is a God of knowledge,\nAnd by him deeds are rightly evaluated.\n4 The bows of mighty men are shattered,\nBut those who are stumbling are given strength.\n5 The well-fed must hire themselves out for bread,\nBut the hungry hunger no more.\nThe barren has given birth to seven,\nBut she who had many sons has become desolate.\n6 Jehovah kills, and he preserves life;\nHe brings down to the Grave, and he raises up.\n7 Jehovah impoverishes, and he enriches;\nHe abases, and he exalts.\n8 He raises the lowly one from the dust;\nHe lifts up the poor from the ash heap,\nTo make them sit with princes,\nGiving them a seat of honor.\nTo Jehovah belong earth's supports,\nAnd he places the productive land upon them.\n9 He guards the steps of his loyal ones,\nBut the wicked will be silenced in darkness,\nFor not by power does a man prevail.\n10 Jehovah will shatter those fighting against him;\nHe will thunder against them from the heavens.\nJehovah will judge to the ends of the earth,\nHe will give power to his king\nAnd exalt the horn of his anointed one.\"\n11 Then Elkanah went to his house in Ramah, but the boy became a minister of Jehovah before Eli the priest.\n12 Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they had no regard for Jehovah. 13 This is what they did with the due right of the priests from the people: Whenever any man was offering a sacrifice, an attendant of the priest came with a three-pronged fork in his hand when the meat was boiling, 14 and he would thrust it into the basin, the two-handled cooking pot, the cauldron, or the one-handled cooking pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. That is what they would do in Shiloh to all the Israelites coming there. 15 Also, even before the man sacrificing could make the fat smoke, an attendant of the priest would come and say to him: \"Give the priest meat to roast. He will not take boiled meat from you, only raw meat.\" 16 When the man would say to him: \"Let them first be sure to make the fat smoke, then take for yourself whatever you desire,\" he would say: \"No, give it to me now; if not, I will take it by force!\" 17 Thus the sin of the attendants came to be very great before Jehovah, for the men treated the offering of Jehovah with disrespect.\n18 Now Samuel was ministering before Jehovah, wearing a linen ephod, though he was just a boy. 19 Also, his mother would make for him a little sleeveless coat, and she brought it up to him year after year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said: \"May Jehovah grant you a child from this wife in place of the one who was lent to Jehovah.\" And they went back home. 21 Jehovah turned his attention to Hannah, so that she could conceive; and she gave birth to three more sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel continued growing up before Jehovah.\n22 Now Eli was very old, but he had heard about everything that his sons were doing to all Israel and how they would lie down with the women who served at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 23 He used to say to them: \"Why do you keep doing things like these? For the things I am hearing about you from all the people are bad. 24 No, my sons, the report that I hear circulating among the people of Jehovah is not good. 25 If a man should sin against another man, someone may appeal to Jehovah for him; but if a man should sin against Jehovah, who can pray for him?\" But they refused to listen to their father, for Jehovah had determined to put them to death. 26 Meanwhile, the boy Samuel kept growing in stature and in favor both with Jehovah and with the people.\n27 A man of God came to Eli and said to him: \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Did I not plainly reveal myself to your father's house while they were in Egypt as slaves to the house of Pharaoh? 28 And he was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to serve as my priest and to go up on my altar to make sacrifices, to offer incense, and to bear an ephod before me; and I gave to the house of your forefather all the offerings made by fire of the Israelites. 29 Why do you men scorn my sacrifice and my offering that I have commanded in my place of dwelling? Why do you keep honoring your sons more than me by fattening yourselves from the best portions of every offering of my people Israel?\n30 \"'That is why the word of Jehovah the God of Israel is: \"I did indeed say that your house and the house of your forefather would always walk before me.\" But now Jehovah declares: \"It is unthinkable, on my part, because those honoring me I will honor, but those despising me will be treated with contempt.\" 31 Look! Days are coming when I will cut off your strength and that of your father's house, so that no man in your house will live to old age. 32 And you will look upon a rival in my dwelling amid all the good that is done to Israel, and never again will there be an old man in your house. 33 The man of yours whom I do not cut off from serving at my altar will cause your eyes to fail and will bring you grief, but the greater number of your house will die by the sword of men. 34 And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be the sign for you: On one day both of them will die. 35 Then I will raise up for myself a faithful priest. He will act in harmony with what is my heart's desire; and I will build for him a lasting house, and he will walk before my anointed one always. 36 Anyone who remains in your house will come and bow down to him for the payment of money and a loaf of bread, and will say: \"Assign me, please, to one of the priestly offices to eat a piece of bread.\"'\"\nChapter 3\n1 Meanwhile, the boy Samuel was ministering to Jehovah before Eli, but word from Jehovah had become rare in those days; visions were not widespread.\n2 One day Eli was lying down in his usual place, and his eyes had grown dim; he was not able to see. 3 The lamp of God had not yet been extinguished, and Samuel was lying in the temple of Jehovah, where the Ark of God was. 4 Jehovah then called Samuel. He answered: \"Here I am.\" 5 He ran to Eli and said: \"Here I am, for you called me.\" But he said: \"I did not call. Lie down again.\" So he went and lay down. 6 Jehovah called once again: \"Samuel!\" At this Samuel got up and went to Eli and said: \"Here I am, for you called me.\" But he said: \"I did not call, my son. Lie down again.\" 7 (Now Samuel had not yet come to know Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him.) 8 So Jehovah called again, a third time: \"Samuel!\" At that he got up and went to Eli and said: \"Here I am, for you called me.\"\nEli then realized that it was Jehovah who was calling the boy. 9 So Eli said to Samuel: \"Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you should say, 'Speak, Jehovah, for your servant is listening.'\" And Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n10 Jehovah came and stood there, and he called as at the other times: \"Samuel, Samuel!\" At this Samuel said: \"Speak, for your servant is listening.\" 11 Jehovah said to Samuel: \"Look! I am doing something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle. 12 On that day I will carry out toward Eli all that I said about his house, from start to finish. 13 You must tell him that I am bringing a lasting judgment on his house for the error that he has known about, for his sons are cursing God, but he has not rebuked them. 14 That is why I have sworn to the house of Eli that the error of the house of Eli will never be atoned for by sacrifices or by offerings.\"\n15 Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of Jehovah's house. Samuel was afraid to tell Eli of the vision. 16 But Eli called for Samuel: \"Samuel, my son!\" At this he said: \"Here I am.\" 17 He asked: \"What message did he speak to you? Please, do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and add to it if you hide from me a single word of all that he said to you.\" 18 So Samuel told him everything, and he did not hide anything from him. Eli said: \"It is Jehovah. Let him do what is good in his eyes.\"\n19 Samuel continued growing up, and Jehovah himself was with him and did not let any of all his words go unfulfilled. 20 All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba became aware that Samuel had been confirmed as Jehovah's prophet. 21 And Jehovah continued to appear in Shiloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.\nChapter 4\n1 And the word of Samuel went out to all Israel.\nThen Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle; they camped beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines were encamped at Aphek. 2 The Philistines drew up in battle formation to meet Israel, but the battle went badly and Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about 4,000 men from the battle line in the field. 3 When the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said: \"Why did Jehovah allow us to be defeated today by the Philistines? Let us take the ark of Jehovah's covenant with us from Shiloh, so that it may be with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.\" 4 So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they carried from there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of armies, who sits enthroned above the cherubs. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were also there with the ark of the covenant of the true God.\n5 As soon as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all the Israelites broke out into loud shouting, so that the earth shook. 6 When the Philistines heard the sound of the shouting, they said: \"Why is there such loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?\" Finally they learned that the Ark of Jehovah had come into the camp. 7 The Philistines became afraid, for they said: \"God has come into the camp!\" So they said: \"Too bad for us, for nothing like this has ever happened before! 8 Too bad for us! Who will save us from the hand of this majestic God? This is the God who struck Egypt with every sort of slaughter in the wilderness. 9 Be courageous and act like men, you Philistines, so that you may not serve the Hebrews just as they have served you. Act like men and fight!\" 10 So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and each one fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; on Israel's side, 30,000 foot soldiers fell. 11 Moreover, the Ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.\n12 A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and arrived at Shiloh on that day with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head. 13 When the man arrived, Eli was sitting on the seat by the roadside watching, because his heart was trembling over the Ark of the true God. The man went into the city to report the news, and the whole city began crying out. 14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he asked: \"What does the sound of this turmoil mean?\" The same man hurried in and reported the news to Eli. 15 (Now Eli was 98 years old, and his eyes stared straight ahead, and he could not see.) 16 Then the man said to Eli: \"I am the one who came from the battle line! Just today I fled from the battle line.\" At this he asked: \"What happened, my son?\" 17 So the bearer of the news related: \"Israel has fled from the Philistines, and there was a great defeat among the people; also your own two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, have died, and the Ark of the true God has been captured.\"\n18 At the moment he mentioned the Ark of the true God, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for 40 years. 19 His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard the report that the Ark of the true God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she doubled over and unexpectedly went into labor and gave birth. 20 As she was dying, the women standing by her said: \"Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.\" She did not answer and did not pay attention to it. 21 But she named the boy Ichabod, saying: \"Glory has gone away from Israel into exile,\" referring to the capture of the Ark of the true God and what happened to her father-in-law and her husband. 22 She said: \"Glory has gone away from Israel into exile, because the Ark of the true God has been captured.\"\nChapter 5\n1 When the Philistines captured the Ark of the true God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 2 The Philistines took the Ark of the true God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it beside Dagon. 3 When the Ashdodites got up early the next day, there was Dagon fallen facedown on the ground before the Ark of Jehovah. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. 4 When they got up early in the morning on the following day, there was Dagon fallen facedown on the ground before the Ark of Jehovah. The head of Dagon and the palms of both his hands were cut off and were lying on the threshold. Only the fish part had been left intact. 5 That is why to this day, the priests of Dagon and all those who enter the house of Dagon do not walk on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod.\n6 The hand of Jehovah was heavy against the Ashdodites, and he devastated them by striking Ashdod and its territories with piles. 7 When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said: \"Do not let the Ark of the God of Israel remain with us, for his hand has dealt harshly with us and our god Dagon.\" 8 So they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and asked them: \"What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?\" They replied: \"Let the Ark of the God of Israel be moved to Gath.\" So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel there.\n9 After they moved it there, the hand of Jehovah came against the city, bringing great panic. He struck the men of the city, from small to great, and piles broke out on them. 10 So they sent the Ark of the true God to Ekron, but as soon as the Ark of the true God came to Ekron, the Ekronites began to cry out: \"They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us to put us and our people to death!\" 11 Then they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said: \"Send the Ark of the God of Israel away; let it return to its place so that we and our people may not be put to death.\" For the terror of death had spread through the whole city; the hand of the true God had been very heavy there, 12 and the men who did not die had been struck with piles. And the city's cry for help ascended to the heavens.\nChapter 6\n1 The Ark of Jehovah was in Philistine territory for seven months. 2 The Philistines called the priests and the diviners and asked: \"What should we do with the Ark of Jehovah? Let us know how we should send it back to its place.\" 3 They replied: \"If you send the ark of the covenant of Jehovah the God of Israel away, do not send it back without an offering. You should by all means return to him a guilt offering. Only then will you be healed, and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned away from you.\" 4 So they asked: \"What guilt offering should we send to him?\" They said: \"According to the number of the lords of the Philistines, send five golden piles and five golden mice, for the same scourge has afflicted every one of you and your lords. 5 You should make images of your piles and images of your mice that are bringing the land to ruin, and you should honor the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten the weight of his hand that is on you and your god and your land. 6 Why should you harden your heart as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He dealt harshly with them, they had to send Israel away, and they departed. 7 Now prepare a new wagon and two cows that have calves and have never been under a yoke. Then hitch the cows to the wagon, but take their calves back home, away from them. 8 Take the Ark of Jehovah and place it on the wagon, and put the golden articles that you are sending to him as a guilt offering in a box next to it. Then send it on its way 9 and watch: If it goes up the road to Beth-shemesh, to its own territory, then he is the one who has done this great evil to us. But if not, we will know that it was not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.\"\n10 The men did accordingly. They took two cows that had calves and hitched them to the wagon, and the calves they penned up at home. 11 Then they put the Ark of Jehovah on the wagon, as well as the box containing the golden mice and the images of their piles. 12 And the cows went straight ahead on the road to Beth-shemesh. They stayed on the one highway, mooing as they went; they did not turn either to the right or to the left. All the while the lords of the Philistines were walking behind them as far as the boundary of Beth-shemesh. 13 The people of Beth-shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley plain. When they raised their eyes and saw the Ark, they were overjoyed at seeing it. 14 The wagon came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and stopped there near a large stone. So they chopped up the wood of the wagon, and they offered the cows as a burnt offering to Jehovah.\n15 The Levites took down the Ark of Jehovah and the box that was with it, which contained the golden articles, and they put them on the large stone. The men of Beth-shemesh offered up burnt offerings and made sacrifices on that day to Jehovah.\n16 When the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day. 17 Now these are the golden piles that the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to Jehovah: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron. 18 And the number of the golden mice corresponded to the number of all the cities of the Philistines that belonged to the five lords-both the fortified cities and the villages in the open country.\nAnd the large stone upon which they rested the Ark of Jehovah serves as a witness down to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite. 19 But God struck down the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked upon the Ark of Jehovah. He struck down 50,070 among the people, and the people began mourning because Jehovah had struck them down with a great slaughter. 20 So the men of Beth-shemesh asked: \"Who will be able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God, and to whom will he go away from us?\" 21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying: \"The Philistines have returned the Ark of Jehovah. Come down and take it up with you.\"\nChapter 7\n1 So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the Ark of Jehovah up into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they sanctified his son Eleazar to guard the Ark of Jehovah.\n2 A long time elapsed, 20 years in all, from the day of the Ark's coming to Kiriath-jearim, and all the house of Israel began to seek after Jehovah. 3 Samuel then said to all the house of Israel: \"If you are returning to Jehovah with all your heart, put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreth images from among you, and direct your heart unswervingly to Jehovah and serve only him, and he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines.\" 4 At that the Israelites got rid of the Baals and the Ashtoreth images and served only Jehovah.\n5 Then Samuel said: \"Gather all Israel together at Mizpah, and I will pray to Jehovah in your behalf.\" 6 So they gathered together at Mizpah, and they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah and kept a fast on that day. There they said: \"We have sinned against Jehovah.\" And Samuel began serving as judge over the Israelites in Mizpah.\n7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. 8 So the Israelites said to Samuel: \"Do not stop calling to Jehovah our God to help us and to save us from the hand of the Philistines.\" 9 Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah; and Samuel called to Jehovah for help in behalf of Israel, and Jehovah answered him. 10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines advanced for battle against Israel. Jehovah now caused it to thunder loudly on that day against the Philistines, and He threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. 11 At that the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down as far as south of Beth-car. 12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Jeshanah and named it Ebenezer, for he said: \"Until now Jehovah has helped us.\" 13 Thus the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come again into the territory of Israel; and the hand of Jehovah continued against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 14 Also, the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines.\nThere was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n15 Samuel kept on judging Israel throughout his life. 16 Each year he traveled in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. 17 But he would return to Ramah, because his house was there, and there he also judged Israel. He built an altar there to Jehovah.\nChapter 8\n1 When Samuel had grown old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel. 2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba. 3 But his sons did not walk in his ways; they were inclined to pursue dishonest profit, they accepted bribes, and they perverted justice.\n4 In time all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah. 5 They said to him: \"Look! You have grown old, but your sons are not walking in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the other nations.\" 6 But it displeased Samuel when they said: \"Give us a king to judge us.\" Then Samuel prayed to Jehovah, 7 and Jehovah said to Samuel: \"Listen to everything the people say to you; for it is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected as their king. 8 They are doing just as they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day; they keep forsaking me and serving other gods, and that is what they are doing to you. 9 Now listen to them. However, you should solemnly warn them; tell them what the king who rules over them will have the right to demand.\"\n10 So Samuel told the people who were asking him for a king all the words of Jehovah. 11 He said: \"This is what the king who rules over you will have the right to demand: He will take your sons and put them in his chariots and make them his horsemen, and some will have to run before his chariots. 12 And he will appoint for himself chiefs over thousands and chiefs over fifties, and some will do his plowing, reap his harvest, and make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 13 He will take your daughters to be ointment mixers, cooks, and bakers. 14 He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and he will give them to his servants. 15 He will take the tenth of your grainfields and your vineyards, and he will give it to his court officials and his servants. 16 And he will take your male and female servants, your best herds, and your donkeys, and he will use them for his work. 17 He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you will become his servants. 18 The day will come when you will cry out because of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but Jehovah will not answer you in that day.\"\n19 However, the people refused to listen to what Samuel told them, and they said: \"No, we are determined to have a king over us. 20 Then we will be like all the other nations, and our king will judge us and lead us and fight our battles.\" 21 After Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the hearing of Jehovah. 22 Jehovah said to Samuel: \"Listen to them, and appoint a king to reign over them.\" Samuel then said to the men of Israel: \"Each of you should return to his city.\"\nChapter 9\n1 There was a man of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror son of Becorath son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite and a very wealthy man. 2 He had a son named Saul, who was young and handsome-there was no man among the Israelites more handsome than he-and he stood head and shoulders taller than all the people.\n3 When the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish got lost, Kish said to his son Saul: \"Please take with you one of the attendants and go look for the donkeys.\" 4 They passed through the mountainous region of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah, and they did not find them. They traveled through the land of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. They passed through the entire land of the Benjaminites, and they did not find them.\n5 They came into the land of Zuph, and Saul said to his attendant who was with him: \"Come, let us return, so that my father does not start worrying about us rather than the donkeys.\" 6 But the attendant replied: \"Look, there is a man of God in this city, a man who is held in honor. All that he says is sure to come true. Let us go there now. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.\" 7 At this Saul said to his attendant: \"If we go, what can we take to the man? There is no bread in our bags; there is nothing to take as a gift to the man of the true God. What do we have?\" 8 So the attendant answered Saul again: \"Look! There is a quarter of a shekel of silver in my hand. I will give it to the man of the true God, and he will tell us which way to go.\" 9 (In former times in Israel, this was what a man would say when going to seek God: \"Come, and let us go to the seer.\" For the prophet of today used to be called a seer in former times.) 10 Then Saul said to his attendant: \"What you said is good. Let us go.\" So they went to the city where the man of the true God was.\n11 While they were going up the ascent to the city, they met girls going out to draw water. So they said to them: \"Is the seer in this place?\" 12 They answered: \"He is. Look, he is just ahead of you. Hurry now, for today he has come to the city, because the people are making a sacrifice today on the high place. 13 As soon as you come into the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he comes, for he is the one who blesses the sacrifice. Once that is done, those who are invited may eat. So now go up right away, and you will find him.\" 14 So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the middle of the city, there was Samuel coming out to meet them to go up to the high place.\n15 The day before Saul came, Jehovah had told Samuel: 16 \"Tomorrow about this time, I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin. You must anoint him as leader over my people Israel, and he will save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen the affliction of my people, and their outcry has reached me.\" 17 When Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah told him: \"Here is the man of whom I said to you, 'This is the one who will govern my people.'\"\n18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said: \"Tell me, please, where is the house of the seer?\" 19 Samuel answered Saul: \"I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, and you will eat with me today. I will send you away in the morning, and I will tell you all that you want to know. 20 As for the donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And to whom does all that is desirable of Israel belong? Is it not to you and to the whole house of your father?\" 21 At this Saul answered: \"Am I not a Benjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? So why have you spoken to me in this way?\"\n22 Then Samuel took Saul and his attendant and brought them to the dining hall and gave them a place at the head of those invited; there were about 30 men. 23 Samuel said to the cook: \"Bring the portion that I gave you and told you, 'Set it aside.'\" 24 At that the cook lifted up the leg and what was on it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said: \"What has been reserved has been set before you. Eat, because they have reserved it for you for this occasion. For I told them, 'I invited guests.'\" So Saul ate with Samuel on that day. 25 Then they went down from the high place to the city, and he continued to speak with Saul on the housetop. 26 They rose early, and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: \"Get ready, so that I may send you away.\" So Saul got ready and both he and Samuel went outside. 27 While they were descending toward the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul: \"Tell the attendant to go on ahead of us,\" so he went on ahead. \"But you, stand still now, so that I may let you hear the word of God.\"\nChapter 10\n1 Samuel then took the flask of oil and poured it out on Saul's head. He kissed him and said: \"Has not Jehovah anointed you as a leader over his inheritance? 2 When you leave me today, you will find two men near the tomb of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, 'The donkeys that you went to look for have been found, but now your father has forgotten about the donkeys and is worried about you. He is saying: \"What should I do about my son?\"' 3 Go on from there until you come to the big tree of Tabor, where you will meet three men going up to the true God at Bethel, one carrying three young goats, one carrying three loaves of bread, and one carrying a large jar of wine. 4 They will ask about your welfare and give you two loaves, and you must accept the loaves from them. 5 After that you will come to the hill of the true God, where there is a garrison of the Philistines. When you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, and a stringed instrument and tambourine and flute and harp will be played ahead of them while they are prophesying. 6 The spirit of Jehovah will empower you, and you will prophesy along with them and be changed into a different person. 7 When these signs have taken place, do whatever your hand finds possible, because the true God is with you. 8 Then go down ahead of me to Gilgal, and I will go down to you there to offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices. You should wait for seven days until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you should do.\"\n9 As soon as Saul turned around to leave Samuel, God began changing his heart to be like that of someone else, and all these signs came true on that day. 10 So they went from there to the hill, and a group of prophets met him. At once the spirit of God empowered him, and he began to prophesy among them. 11 When all those who previously knew him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they said to one another: \"What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\" 12 Then a man from there said: \"But who is their father?\" So it became a saying: \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"\n13 When he finished prophesying, he came to the high place. 14 The brother of Saul's father later said to him and to his attendant: \"Where did you go?\" At that he said: \"To look for the donkeys, but we saw that they were not there, so we went to Samuel.\" 15 Saul's uncle asked: \"Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?\" 16 Saul replied to his uncle: \"He told us that the donkeys had already been found.\" But Saul did not tell him what Samuel said about the matter of the kingship.\n17 Samuel then called the people together to Jehovah at Mizpah 18 and said to the Israelites: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'It was I who brought Israel up out of Egypt and who rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you. 19 But today you have rejected your God who was your Savior out of all your evils and distresses, and you said: \"No, you should appoint a king over us.\" Now take your stand before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands.'\"\n20 So Samuel had all the tribes of Israel draw near, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected. 21 Then he had the tribe of Benjamin draw near by its families, and the family of the Matrites was selected. Finally Saul the son of Kish was selected. But when they went to look for him, he was nowhere to be found. 22 So they inquired of Jehovah: \"Has the man come here yet?\" Jehovah answered: \"There he is hiding himself among the luggage.\" 23 So they ran and brought him from there. When he stood in the middle of the people, he was head and shoulders taller than all the other people. 24 Samuel said to all the people: \"Do you see the one whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?\" And all the people began to shout: \"Long live the king!\"\n25 Samuel spoke to the people about the rightful due of kings and wrote it in a book and deposited it before Jehovah. Then Samuel sent all the people away, everyone to his house. 26 Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by the warriors whose hearts Jehovah had touched. 27 But some worthless men said: \"How will this one save us?\" So they despised him, and they did not bring any gift to him. But he said nothing about it.\nChapter 11\n1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and camped against Jabesh in Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash: \"Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.\" 2 Nahash the Ammonite said to them: \"I will make it with you on this condition: that all your right eyes be bored out. I will do this to humiliate all Israel.\" 3 The elders of Jabesh replied to him: \"Give us seven days' time so that we can send messengers into all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to rescue us, we will surrender to you.\" 4 In time the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke these words in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept at the top of their voice.\n5 But Saul was coming from the field behind the herd, and Saul said: \"What is the matter with the people? Why are they weeping?\" So they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh. 6 The spirit of God empowered Saul when he heard these words, and he burned with anger. 7 So he took a pair of bulls and cut them into pieces, and he sent these into all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, who said: \"Whoever does not follow Saul and Samuel should expect this to be done to his cattle!\" And the fear of Jehovah fell upon the people, so that they came out with one accord. 8 Then he counted them in Bezek, and there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah. 9 They now said to the messengers who had come: \"This is what you should say to the men of Jabesh in Gilead, 'Tomorrow when the sun gets hot, you will be saved.'\" With that the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, and they were overjoyed. 10 So the men of Jabesh said: \"Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.\"\n11 On the next day, Saul divided the people into three bands, and they made their way into the middle of the camp during the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the day grew hot. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together. 12 Then the people said to Samuel: \"Who was saying, 'Is Saul to be king over us?' Hand the men over, and we will put them to death.\" 13 However, Saul said: \"Not a man should be put to death on this day, for today Jehovah has rescued Israel.\"\n14 Samuel later said to the people: \"Come and let us go to Gilgal to reconfirm the kingship.\" 15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and in Gilgal they made Saul king before Jehovah. Then they offered communion sacrifices there before Jehovah, and Saul and all the men of Israel celebrated with great joy.\nChapter 12\n1 Finally Samuel said to all Israel: \"Here I have done all that you asked of me, and I appointed a king to reign over you. 2 Now here is the king who is leading you! As for me, I have grown old and gray, and my sons are here with you, and I have led you from my youth until this day. 3 Here I am. Testify against me before Jehovah and before his anointed one: Whose bull or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded or crushed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me look the other way? If I have, I will restore it to you.\" 4 To this they said: \"You have not defrauded us or crushed us or accepted anything at all from anyone's hand.\" 5 So he said to them: \"Jehovah is a witness against you, and his anointed one is a witness this day that you have found nothing to accuse me of.\" To this they said: \"He is a witness.\"\n6 So Samuel said to the people: \"Jehovah, who used Moses and Aaron and who brought your forefathers up out of the land of Egypt, is a witness. 7 And now take your positions, and I will judge you before Jehovah in view of all the righteous acts that Jehovah has done for you and for your forefathers.\n8 \"As soon as Jacob had come into Egypt and your forefathers began calling to Jehovah for help, Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron to lead your forefathers out of Egypt and to cause them to dwell in this place. 9 But they forgot Jehovah their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera the chief of the army of Hazor and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10 And they called to Jehovah for help and said, 'We have sinned, for we have left Jehovah to serve the Baals and the Ashtoreth images; now rescue us out of the hand of our enemies so that we may serve you.' 11 Then Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel and rescued you from the hand of the enemies all around you, so that you could live in security. 12 When you saw that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, had come against you, you kept saying to me, 'No, we are determined to have a king over us!' even though Jehovah your God is your King. 13 Now here is the king whom you have chosen, the one you asked for. Look! Jehovah has appointed a king over you. 14 If you fear Jehovah and serve him and obey his voice and you do not rebel against the order of Jehovah, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow Jehovah your God, fine. 15 But if you do not obey the voice of Jehovah and you rebel against the order of Jehovah, the hand of Jehovah will be against you and your fathers. 16 Now take your positions and see this great thing that Jehovah is doing before your eyes. 17 Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on Jehovah to make it thunder and rain; then know and understand what an evil thing you have done in the eyes of Jehovah in asking for a king for yourselves.\"\n18 At that Samuel called to Jehovah, and Jehovah made it thunder and rain on that day, so that all the people were greatly in fear of Jehovah and of Samuel. 19 And all the people said to Samuel: \"Pray to Jehovah your God for your servants, as we do not want to die, for we have added to all our sins another evil by asking for a king.\"\n20 So Samuel said to the people: \"Do not be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil. Only do not turn away from following Jehovah, and serve Jehovah with all your heart. 21 Do not turn away to follow the empty things, which are of no benefit and cannot rescue, because they are empty. 22 For the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people, for Jehovah has taken it upon himself to make you his people. 23 As for me, it is unthinkable for me to sin against Jehovah by ceasing to pray in your behalf, and I will continue to instruct you in the good and right way. 24 Only fear Jehovah, and serve him faithfully with all your heart, for see what great things he has done for you. 25 But if you flagrantly do what is bad, you will be swept away, both you and your king.\"\nChapter 13\n1 Saul was ... years old when he became king, and for two years he reigned over Israel. 2 Saul chose 3,000 men out of Israel; 2,000 of these were with Saul at Michmash and in the mountainous region of Bethel and 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people away, each one to his tent. 3 Then Jonathan struck down the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. And Saul had the horn blown throughout all the land, saying: \"Let the Hebrews hear!\" 4 All Israel heard the news: \"Saul has struck down a garrison of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench among the Philistines.\" So the people were summoned to follow Saul at Gilgal.\n5 The Philistines also gathered together to fight against Israel, with 30,000 war chariots and 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; and they went up and camped in Michmash to the east of Beth-aven. 6 And the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because they were hard-pressed; so the people hid in the caves, the hollows, the crags, the cellars, and the cisterns. 7 Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people following him were trembling. 8 He continued waiting for seven days until the designated time that Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him. 9 Finally Saul said: \"Bring to me the burnt sacrifice and the communion sacrifices.\" And he offered up the burnt sacrifice.\n10 But as soon as he had finished offering up the burnt sacrifice, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to meet him and bless him. 11 Then Samuel said: \"What have you done?\" Saul replied: \"I saw that the people were deserting me, and you did not come within the designated time, and the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash. 12 So I said to myself, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of Jehovah.' So I felt obligated to offer up the burnt sacrifice.\"\n13 At this Samuel said to Saul: \"You have acted foolishly. You have not obeyed the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you. If you had, Jehovah would have made your kingdom firm over Israel forever. 14 But now your kingdom will not last. Jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart, and Jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people, because you did not obey what Jehovah commanded you.\"\n15 Then Samuel rose and went his way up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin, and Saul took the count of the people; those still with him were about 600 men. 16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the people still with them were dwelling in Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines had encamped at Michmash. 17 And the raiding parties would go out from the camp of the Philistines in three bands. One band would turn toward the road to Ophrah, to the land of Shual; 18 another band would turn toward the road of Beth-horon; and the third band would turn toward the road leading to the boundary that overlooks the valley of Zeboim, toward the wilderness.\n19 Now there was not a metalworker to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said: \"So that the Hebrews may not make a sword or a spear.\" 20 And all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines to get their plowshares, mattocks, axes, or sickles sharpened. 21 The price for sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, for the mattocks, for the three-toothed instruments, for the axes, and for fixing fast the oxgoad. 22 And on the day of battle, not a sword or a spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.\n23 Now a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the ravine pass of Michmash.\nChapter 14\n1 One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the attendant carrying his weapons: \"Come and let us cross over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.\" But he did not tell his father. 2 Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree in Migron, and there were about 600 men with him. 3 (And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, was carrying the ephod.) And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. 4 Now between the passages that Jonathan was trying to cross over to reach the outpost of the Philistines, there was a toothlike crag on one side and a toothlike crag on the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh. 5 The one crag was a pillar on the north facing Michmash, and the other was on the south facing Geba.\n6 So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer: \"Come and let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf, for nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few.\" 7 At this his armor-bearer said to him: \"Do whatever your heart impels you to do. Turn wherever you wish, and I will follow you wherever your heart impels you.\" 8 Then Jonathan said: \"We will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them. 9 If they say to us, 'Stand still until we come to you!' we will stand where we are and not go up to them. 10 But if they say, 'Come up against us!' we will go up, because Jehovah will give them into our hand. This will be our sign.\"\n11 Then both of them revealed their presence to the outpost of the Philistines. The Philistines said: \"Look! The Hebrews are coming out from the holes where they have been hiding.\" 12 So the men of the outpost said to Jonathan and his armor-bearer: \"Come up to us, and we will teach you a lesson!\" At once Jonathan said to his armor-bearer: \"Follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.\" 13 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer was behind him; and the Philistines began to fall before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer was putting them to death behind him. 14 In the first attack that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, they struck down about 20 men within about half the plowing line in an acre of field.\n15 Then terror spread in the field camp and among all the people of the outpost, and even the raiding parties were terrified. The earth began quaking, and a terror from God ensued. 16 Saul's watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the turmoil was spreading in every direction.\n17 Saul said to the people with him: \"Take a count, please, and see who has left us.\" When they took the count, they saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. 18 Saul now said to Ahijah: \"Bring the Ark of the true God near!\" (For the Ark of the true God was with the Israelites at that time.) 19 And while Saul was speaking to the priest, the turmoil in the camp of the Philistines was growing greater and greater. Then Saul said to the priest: \"Stop what you are doing.\" 20 So Saul and all the people with him assembled and went into the battle, where they found that the Philistines had turned their swords against one another, and the confusion was very great. 21 Also, the Hebrews who had previously sided with the Philistines and who had come up with them into the camp were going over to Israel under Saul and Jonathan. 22 All the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountainous region of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, and they too joined in pursuing them in the battle. 23 So Jehovah saved Israel on that day, and the battle extended as far as Beth-aven.\n24 But the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul had put the people under this oath: \"Cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening and until I have taken vengeance on my enemies!\" So none of the people ate any food.\n25 And all the people came into the forest, and there was honey on the ground. 26 When the people came into the forest, they saw the honey dripping, but no one would put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. 27 But Jonathan had not heard his father put the people under an oath, so he stretched out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. When he drew his hand back to his mouth, his eyes brightened. 28 At this one of the people said: \"Your father put the people under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed is the man who eats food today!' That is why the people are so tired.\" 29 However, Jonathan said: \"My father has brought great trouble on the land. Look at how my eyes brightened because I tasted this little bit of honey. 30 How much better if the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies that they found! For then the slaughter of the Philistines would have been even greater.\"\n31 On that day they kept striking down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people became very tired. 32 So the people began rushing greedily at the spoil, and they took sheep and cattle and calves and slaughtered them on the ground, and they ate the meat along with the blood. 33 So it was reported to Saul: \"Look! The people are sinning against Jehovah by eating meat with the blood.\" At this he said: \"You have acted faithlessly. Roll a large stone to me immediately.\" 34 Saul then said: \"Spread out among the people and say to them, 'Each of you must bring his bull and his sheep and slaughter them here and then eat them. Do not sin against Jehovah by eating meat with the blood.'\" So each of them brought his bull with him that night and slaughtered it there. 35 And Saul built an altar to Jehovah. This was the first altar he built to Jehovah.\n36 Saul later said: \"Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light. We will not leave a single survivor.\" To this they said: \"Do whatever seems good in your eyes.\" Then the priest said: \"Let us approach the true God here.\" 37 And Saul inquired of God: \"Should I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?\" But God did not answer him on that day. 38 So Saul said: \"Come here, all you chiefs of the people, and find out what sin has been committed today. 39 For as surely as Jehovah is alive, who rescued Israel, even if it turns out to be Jonathan my son, he must die.\" But none of the people would answer him. 40 Then he said to all Israel: \"You will be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side.\" At this the people said to Saul: \"Do whatever seems good in your eyes.\"\n41 Saul then said to Jehovah: \"O God of Israel, answer with the Thummim!\" Then Jonathan and Saul were selected, and the people went free. 42 Saul now said: \"Cast lots to decide between me and my son Jonathan.\" And Jonathan was selected. 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan: \"Tell me, what have you done?\" So Jonathan told him: \"I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand. Here I am! I am ready to die!\"\n44 At this Saul said: \"Thus may God do and may he add to it if you do not die, Jonathan.\" 45 But the people said to Saul: \"Should Jonathan die-the one who brought this great victory to Israel? It is unthinkable! As surely as Jehovah is alive, not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground, for it was with God that he acted this day.\" With that the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.\n46 So Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own territory.\n47 Saul secured the kingship over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side, against the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he went he defeated them. 48 And he fought bravely and conquered the Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of their plunderers.\n49 The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And he had two daughters; the name of the older one was Merab, and the name of the younger one, Michal. 50 The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the chief of his army was Abner the son of Ner, the uncle of Saul. 51 Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\n52 There was fierce warfare with the Philistines all the days of Saul. When Saul saw any strong or courageous man, he would recruit him into his service.\nChapter 15\n1 Then Samuel said to Saul: \"Jehovah sent me to anoint you as king over his people Israel; now listen to what Jehovah has to say. 2 This is what Jehovah of armies says: 'I will call to account the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they opposed them along their way coming up from Egypt. 3 Now go, and strike down the Amalekites, and devote them to destruction along with all that they have. You must not spare them; you are to put them to death, man as well as woman, child as well as infant, bull as well as sheep, camel as well as donkey.'\" 4 Saul summoned the people and counted them in Telaim: There were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.\n5 Saul advanced as far as the city of Amalek and set an ambush by the valley. 6 Saul then said to the Kenites: \"Go, depart from among the Amalekites, so that I do not sweep you away with them. For you showed loyal love to all the people of Israel at the time they came up out of Egypt.\" So the Kenites departed from the midst of Amalek. 7 After that Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is next to Egypt. 8 He caught Agag the king of Amalek alive, but all the other people he devoted to destruction with the sword. 9 However, Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the flock, the herd, the fattened animals, the rams, and all that was good. They did not want to devote them to destruction. But all the goods that were worthless and unwanted, these they devoted to destruction.\n10 Then the word of Jehovah came to Samuel: 11 \"I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following me and he has not carried out my words.\" Samuel became very upset, and he kept crying out to Jehovah all night long. 12 When Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul, Samuel was told: \"Saul went to Carmel, and there he erected a monument for himself. Then he turned around and went down to Gilgal.\" 13 When Samuel finally came to him, Saul said to him: \"May Jehovah bless you. I have carried out the word of Jehovah.\" 14 But Samuel said: \"Then what is this sound of the flock in my ears and the sound of the cattle that I hear?\" 15 To this Saul said: \"They were brought from the Amalekites, because the people spared the best of the flock and the herd for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God; but what was left we devoted to destruction.\" 16 At this Samuel said to Saul: \"Stop! Let me tell you what Jehovah said to me last night.\" So he said to him: \"Speak!\"\n17 Samuel continued: \"Were you not insignificant in your own eyes when you were made head of the tribes of Israel and when Jehovah anointed you as king over Israel? 18 Jehovah later sent you on a mission and said, 'Go, and devote the sinful Amalekites to destruction. Fight against them until you have exterminated them.' 19 So why did you not obey the voice of Jehovah? Instead, you rushed greedily toward the spoil and did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah!\"\n20 However, Saul said to Samuel: \"But I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah! I went on the mission to which Jehovah sent me, and I brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and I devoted the Amalekites to destruction. 21 But the people took sheep and cattle from the spoil, the best of what was devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Jehovah your God at Gilgal.\"\n22 Samuel then said: \"Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice, and to pay attention than the fat of rams; 23 for rebelliousness is the same as the sin of divination, and pushing ahead presumptuously the same as using magical power and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah, he has rejected you from being king.\"\n24 Then Saul said to Samuel: \"I have sinned, for I have overstepped the order of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and listened to what they said. 25 And now, please, pardon my sin, and return with me so that I may bow down to Jehovah.\" 26 But Samuel said to Saul: \"I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from continuing as king over Israel.\" 27 As Samuel was turning to go, Saul grabbed hold of the hem of his sleeveless coat, but it ripped away. 28 At this Samuel said to him: \"Jehovah has ripped away the royal rule of Israel from you today, and he will give it to one of your fellow men who is better than you. 29 Moreover, the Excellency of Israel will not prove false or change his mind, for He is not a mere man that he should change his mind.\"\n30 At this he said: \"I have sinned. But honor me, please, in front of the elders of my people and in front of Israel. Return with me, and I will bow down to Jehovah your God.\" 31 So Samuel returned behind Saul, and Saul bowed down to Jehovah. 32 And Samuel said: \"Bring Agag the king of Amalek near to me.\" Then Agag went to him reluctantly, for Agag had been saying to himself: 'Surely the threat of death is past.' 33 However, Samuel said: \"Just as your sword has bereaved women of children, so your mother will be most bereaved among women.\" With that Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before Jehovah at Gilgal.\n34 Samuel now went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his own house at Gibeah of Saul. 35 Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel went into mourning for Saul. And Jehovah regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.\nChapter 16\n1 Jehovah eventually said to Samuel: \"How long will you mourn for Saul now that I have rejected him from ruling as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, because I have selected from among his sons a king for myself.\" 2 But Samuel said: \"How can I go? When Saul hears about it, he will kill me.\" Jehovah replied: \"Take a young cow with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah.' 3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice; then I will make known to you what to do. You must anoint for me the one whom I designate to you.\"\n4 Samuel did what Jehovah said. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city were trembling at meeting him, and they said: \"Does your coming mean peace?\" 5 To this he said: \"It means peace. I have come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.\" Then he sanctified Jesse and his sons, after which he summoned them to the sacrifice. 6 As they came in and he saw Eliab, he said: \"Surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one.\" 7 But Jehovah said to Samuel: \"Do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is, for I have rejected him. For the way man sees is not the way God sees, because mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.\" 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before Samuel, but he said: \"Jehovah has not chosen this one either.\" 9 Next Jesse presented Shammah, but he said: \"Jehovah has not chosen this one either.\" 10 So Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse: \"Jehovah has not chosen any of these.\"\n11 Finally Samuel said to Jesse: \"Are these all of your boys?\" To this he said: \"The youngest has been left out until now; he is pasturing the sheep.\" Then Samuel said to Jesse: \"Send for him, because we will not sit down for the meal until he comes here.\" 12 So he sent for him and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and handsome in appearance. Then Jehovah said: \"Get up, anoint him, for this is the one!\" 13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. And the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David from that day forward. Samuel later rose and went his way to Ramah.\n14 Now the spirit of Jehovah had departed from Saul, and a bad spirit from Jehovah terrorized him. 15 The servants of Saul said to him: \"You see that a bad spirit from God is terrorizing you. 16 Let our lord, please, command your servants before you to look for a man who is skilled at playing the harp. Whenever a bad spirit from God comes upon you, he will play it, and you will feel better.\" 17 So Saul said to his servants: \"Find me, please, a man who plays well, and bring him to me.\"\n18 One of the attendants said: \"Look! I have seen how a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite plays skillfully, and he is a courageous, mighty warrior. He can speak well, and he is handsome, and Jehovah is with him.\" 19 Saul then sent messengers to Jesse and said: \"Send to me your son David, who is with the flock.\" 20 So Jesse loaded a donkey with bread, a skin bottle of wine, and a young goat and sent them to Saul with his son David. 21 Thus David came to Saul and began serving him. Saul grew to love him very much, and he became his armor-bearer. 22 Saul sent a message to Jesse: \"Please let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my eyes.\" 23 Whenever a bad spirit from God came upon Saul, David took the harp and played it, and Saul found relief and felt better, and the bad spirit would depart from him.\nChapter 17\n1 And the Philistines assembled their armies for war. They assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 2 Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, and they drew up in battle formation to meet the Philistines. 3 The Philistines occupied the mountain on one side, and the Israelites occupied the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.\n4 Then a champion came out from the camps of the Philistines; his name was Goliath, from Gath, and his height was six cubits and a span. 5 He had a helmet of copper on his head, and he was wearing a coat of mail of overlapping scales. The weight of the copper coat of mail was 5,000 shekels. 6 He had shin guards of copper on his legs and a javelin of copper slung between his shoulders. 7 The wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the iron blade of his spear weighed 600 shekels; and his shield-bearer was marching ahead of him. 8 Then he stood and called out to the battle line of Israel and said to them: \"Why have you come out to draw up in battle formation? Am I not the Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. 9 If he is able to fight with me and strike me down, we will then become your servants. But if I prevail against him and strike him down, you will become our servants and serve us.\" 10 The Philistine then said: \"I do taunt the battle line of Israel this day. Give me a man, and let us fight it out!\"\n11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they became terrified and greatly afraid.\n12 Now David was the son of the Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah named Jesse, who had eight sons and who in the days of Saul was already an old man. 13 The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the war. The names of his three sons who went to war were Eliab the firstborn, his second son Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 14 David was the youngest, and the three oldest followed Saul.\n15 David was going back and forth from Saul to tend the sheep of his father at Bethlehem. 16 Meanwhile, the Philistine would come forward and take his position each morning and each evening for 40 days.\n17 Then Jesse said to his son David: \"Take, please, this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and carry them quickly to your brothers in the camp. 18 And take these ten portions of cheese to the chief of the thousand; also, you should check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back some token from them.\" 19 They were with Saul and all the other men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\n20 So David got up early in the morning and left someone in charge of the sheep; then he packed up and went just as Jesse had commanded him. When he came to the camp enclosure, the army was going out to the battle line, shouting a battle cry. 21 Israel and the Philistines drew up so that one battle line faced the other battle line. 22 David immediately left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he began asking about the welfare of his brothers.\n23 While he was speaking with them, there came the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath. He came out from the battle line of the Philistines, and he spoke the same words as before, and David heard him. 24 When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him, terrified. 25 The men of Israel were saying: \"Have you seen this man who is coming out? He comes to taunt Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who strikes him down, he will give him his own daughter, and he will give the house of his father exemption in Israel.\"\n26 David began to say to the men who were standing near him: \"What will be done for the man who strikes down that Philistine over there and takes away reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should taunt the battle line of the living God?\" 27 Then the people told him the same thing as before: \"This is what will be done for the man who strikes him down.\" 28 When his oldest brother Eliab heard him speak to the men, he became angry with David and said: \"Why have you come down? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I well know your presumptuousness and the bad intentions of your heart; you came down just to see the battle.\" 29 To this David said: \"What have I done now? I was only asking a question!\" 30 So he turned from him toward someone else and asked the same thing as before, and the people gave him the same reply as before.\n31 The words that David had spoken were overheard and reported to Saul. So he sent for him. 32 David said to Saul: \"Let no one lose heart because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\" 33 But Saul said to David: \"You are not able to go fight against this Philistine, for you are but a boy, and he has been a soldier from his youth.\" 34 David then said to Saul: \"Your servant became a shepherd of his father's flock, and a lion came, also a bear, and each carried off a sheep from the flock. 35 I went out after it and struck it down and rescued it from its mouth. When it rose up against me, I grabbed it by its fur and struck it down and put it to death. 36 Your servant struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will become like one of them, for he has taunted the battle lines of the living God.\" 37 Then David added: \"Jehovah, who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear, he is the one who will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.\" At this Saul said to David: \"Go, and may Jehovah be with you.\"\n38 Saul now clothed David with his garments. He put a copper helmet on his head, after which he clothed him with a coat of mail. 39 Then David strapped on his sword over his garments and tried to go but could not, for he was not used to them. David said to Saul: \"I am unable to go in these things, for I am not used to them.\" So David took them off. 40 He then took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the streambed and placed them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag, and his sling was in his hand. And he began approaching the Philistine.\n41 The Philistine came closer and closer to David, and his shield-bearer was ahead of him. 42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he sneered at him in contempt because he was just a ruddy and handsome boy. 43 So the Philistine said to David: \"Am I a dog, so that you are coming against me with sticks?\" With that the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44 The Philistine said to David: \"Just come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field.\"\n45 David replied to the Philistine: \"You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I am coming against you in the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the battle line of Israel, whom you have taunted. 46 This very day Jehovah will surrender you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head; and on this day I will give the corpses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth; and people of all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel. 47 And all those gathered here will know that it is not with the sword or the spear that Jehovah saves, for the battle belongs to Jehovah, and he will give all of you into our hand.\"\n48 Then the Philistine rose and drew steadily closer to meet David, but David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 49 David thrust his hand into his bag and took a stone from there and slung it. He struck the Philistine in the forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell facedown on the ground. 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; he struck down the Philistine and put him to death, though there was no sword in David's hand. 51 David continued running and stood over him. Then he took hold of the Philistine's sword and pulled it out of its sheath and made sure that he was dead by cutting off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their mighty one had died, they fled.\n52 At that the men of Israel and of Judah rose and broke into shouting and pursued the Philistines all the way from the valley to the gates of Ekron, and the slain of the Philistines lay fallen along the road from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron. 53 After the Israelites returned from hotly pursuing the Philistines, they pillaged their camps.\n54 Then David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.\n55 At the moment that Saul saw David go out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the chief of the army: \"Whose son is this boy, Abner?\" Abner replied: \"As surely as you live, O king, I do not know!\" 56 The king said: \"Find out whose son the young man is.\" 57 So as soon as David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 58 Saul now said to him: \"Whose son are you, boy?\" to which David said: \"The son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\"\nChapter 18\n1 As soon as David had finished speaking to Saul, Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship, and Jonathan began to love him as himself. 2 From that day, Saul kept David with him, and he did not allow him to return to his father's house. 3 And Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as himself. 4 Jonathan took off the sleeveless coat that he wore and gave it to David, along with his gear, his sword, his bow, and his belt. 5 David began going out and was successful wherever Saul would send him. So Saul put him in charge of the fighting men, and this pleased all the people and the servants of Saul.\n6 When David and the others would return from striking down the Philistines, the women would come out from all the cities of Israel with song and dances to meet King Saul with tambourines, with rejoicing, and with lutes. 7 The women who were celebrating would sing:\n\"Saul has struck down his thousands,\nAnd David his tens of thousands.\"\n8 Saul became very angry, and this song displeased him, for he said: \"They have credited David with tens of thousands, but to me they have credited thousands. The only thing left to give him is the kingship!\" 9 From that day on, Saul was always looking at David suspiciously.\n10 The next day a bad spirit from God gripped Saul, and he started to act strangely inside the house, while David was playing music on the harp as on other occasions. Saul had a spear in his hand, 11 and he hurled the spear, saying to himself: 'I will pin David to the wall!' But David escaped from him twice. 12 Then Saul was afraid of David because Jehovah was with him but had departed from Saul. 13 So Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him as chief of a thousand, and David would lead the army into battle. 14 David continued to have success in all he did, and Jehovah was with him. 15 And when Saul saw that he was very successful, he became afraid of him. 16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he would lead them in their campaigns.\n17 Saul later said to David: \"Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I will give her to you as a wife. However, you should continue to display your courage for me and fight the wars of Jehovah.\" For Saul said to himself: 'Do not let my hand come against him. Let the hand of the Philistines strike him.' 18 At this David said to Saul: \"Who am I and who are my relatives, my father's family in Israel, for me to become son-in-law to the king?\" 19 However, when the time came to give Saul's daughter Merab to David, she had already been given to be the wife of Adriel the Meholathite.\n20 Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and it was reported to Saul, and this pleased him. 21 So Saul said: \"I will give her to him to serve as a snare to him, so that the hand of the Philistines may come upon him.\" Saul then said to David a second time: \"You will form a marriage alliance with me today.\" 22 Further, Saul ordered his servants: \"Speak to David secretly and say, 'Look! The king is pleased with you, and all his servants are fond of you. So now form a marriage alliance with the king.'\" 23 When Saul's servants told David these things, David said: \"Is it a trivial matter to you to form a marriage alliance with the king when I am a man poor and lightly esteemed?\" 24 Then Saul's servants reported to him: \"These are the words that David spoke.\"\n25 At that Saul said: \"This is what you should say to David, 'The king does not want any bride price except 100 foreskins of the Philistines, to take revenge on the enemies of the king.'\" For Saul was scheming to have David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 26 So his servants reported these words to David, and it was pleasing to David to form a marriage alliance with the king. Before the allotted time, 27 David went with his men and struck down 200 Philistine men, and David brought the full number of their foreskins to the king, to form a marriage alliance with the king. Therefore, Saul gave him his daughter Michal as a wife. 28 Saul realized that Jehovah was with David and that his daughter Michal loved him. 29 This made Saul even more afraid of David, and Saul became an enemy of David for the rest of his life.\n30 The princes of the Philistines would go out to battle, but as often as they went out, David was more successful than all the servants of Saul; and his name was highly esteemed.\nChapter 19\n1 Saul later spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants about putting David to death. 2 Since Saul's son Jonathan was very fond of David, Jonathan told David: \"My father Saul wants to have you put to death. Please be on your guard in the morning, and go to a secret place and remain hidden. 3 I will go out and stand next to my father in the field where you will be. I will talk about you to my father, and if I learn anything, I will be sure to tell you.\"\n4 So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul. He said to him: \"The king should not sin against his servant David, for he has not sinned against you and what he has done for you has benefited you. 5 He risked his life to strike down the Philistine, so that Jehovah brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and you were overjoyed. So why should you sin against innocent blood in having David put to death for no reason?\" 6 Saul listened to Jonathan, and Saul swore: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, he will not be put to death.\" 7 Afterward Jonathan called David and told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he continued to serve him as before.\n8 In time war broke out again, and David went out and fought against the Philistines and struck them down with a great slaughter, and they fled from before him.\n9 And a bad spirit from Jehovah came upon Saul when he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing music on the harp. 10 Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, who drove the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped during that night. 11 Saul later sent messengers to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning, but David's wife Michal told him: \"If you do not escape tonight, tomorrow you will be a dead man.\" 12 Immediately Michal let David down through the window, so that he could run away and escape. 13 Michal took the teraphim statue and placed it on the bed, and she put a net of goat hair at the place of his head, and she covered it with a garment.\n14 Saul now sent messengers to take David, but she said: \"He is sick.\" 15 So Saul sent the messengers to see David and told them: \"Bring him to me on his bed to have him put to death.\" 16 When the messengers came in, there was the teraphim statue on the bed and a net of goat hair where his head would have been. 17 Saul said to Michal: \"Why did you trick me like this and send my enemy away so that he could escape?\" Michal replied to Saul: \"He said to me, 'Send me away, or I will kill you!'\"\n18 Now David had run away and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah. He told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went away, and they stayed in Naioth. 19 In time it was reported to Saul: \"Look! David is in Naioth in Ramah.\" 20 At once Saul sent messengers to seize David. When they saw the elderly ones of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the spirit of God came to be upon Saul's messengers, and they began behaving as prophets as well.\n21 When they told it to Saul, he immediately sent other messengers, and they too began behaving as prophets. So Saul sent messengers again, a third group, and they too began behaving as prophets. 22 Finally he also went to Ramah. When he reached the great cistern that is in Secu, he asked: \"Where are Samuel and David?\" They replied: \"There in Naioth in Ramah.\" 23 While Saul was on his way from there to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God came upon him as well, and he walked along behaving as a prophet until he came into Naioth in Ramah. 24 He also stripped off his garments, and he too behaved as a prophet before Samuel, and he lay there naked all that day and all that night. That is why they say: \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"\nChapter 20\n1 Then David ran away from Naioth in Ramah. However, he came to Jonathan and said: \"What have I done? What is my offense, and how have I sinned against your father for him to seek my life?\" 2 At this Jonathan said to him: \"It is unthinkable! You will not die. Look! My father will not do anything, great or small, without disclosing it to me. Why should my father hide this matter from me? This will not happen.\" 3 But David swore further and said: \"Your father surely knows that I have found favor in your eyes and would say, 'Do not let Jonathan know this or he will be upset.' But as surely as Jehovah is living and as surely as you are living, there is only a step between me and death!\"\n4 Then Jonathan said to David: \"Whatever you say, I will do for you.\" 5 David said to Jonathan: \"Tomorrow is the new moon, and I am certainly expected to sit with the king to eat; you must send me away, and I will hide in the field until the evening on the third day. 6 If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David begged me for permission to go quickly to his city Bethlehem, because there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.' 7 If his response is, 'That is fine,' it means peace to your servant. But if he becomes angry, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. 8 Show loyal love to your servant, for you have brought your servant into Jehovah's covenant with you. But if I am guilty, put me to death yourself. Why turn me over to your father?\"\n9 To this Jonathan said: \"It is unthinkable to suggest that about you! If I learn that my father is determined to harm you, would I not tell you?\" 10 Then David said to Jonathan: \"Who will tell me whether your father gives you a harsh answer?\" 11 Jonathan said to David: \"Come, let us go out into the field.\" So both of them went out into the field. 12 And Jonathan said to David: \"Let Jehovah the God of Israel be a witness that I will sound out my father about this time tomorrow or by the third day. If he is favorably disposed toward David, will I not then send you word and disclose it to you? 13 But if my father intends to harm you, may Jehovah do that and more to Jonathan if I do not disclose it to you and send you away in peace. May Jehovah be with you, just as he was with my father. 14 And will you not show me the loyal love of Jehovah while I am alive and even when I die? 15 Never withdraw your loyal love from my household, even when Jehovah wipes out all the enemies of David from the face of the earth.\" 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"Jehovah will require it and call David's enemies to account.\" 17 So Jonathan had David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved himself.\n18 Jonathan then said to him: \"Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will be vacant. 19 By the third day, you will be missed even more, and you must go to the place where you hid the other day and stay near the stone here. 20 I will then shoot three arrows to one side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. 21 When I send the attendant, I will say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the attendant, 'Look! The arrows are on this side of you, get them,' then you may come back, for as surely as Jehovah is living, it means everything is peaceful for you and there is no danger. 22 But if I should say to the boy, 'Look! The arrows are beyond you,' then go, for Jehovah has sent you away. 23 As for the promise that we have made, you and I, may Jehovah be between us forever.\"\n24 So David hid in the field. When the new moon came, the king took his seat at the meal to eat. 25 The king was sitting in his usual seat by the wall. Jonathan was facing him, and Abner was sitting at Saul's side, but David's place was vacant. 26 Saul did not say anything that day, for he said to himself: 'Something has happened so that he is not clean. Yes, he must be unclean.' 27 And the day after the new moon, on the second day, David's place continued vacant. Saul then said to Jonathan his son: \"Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal either yesterday or today?\" 28 Jonathan answered Saul: \"David begged me for permission to go to Bethlehem. 29 He said, 'Please permit me to go, because we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my own brother summoned me. So if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table.\" 30 Then Saul became enraged with Jonathan, and he said to him: \"You son of a rebellious woman, do you think I do not know that you are choosing to side with the son of Jesse, to your own shame and to the shame of your mother? 31 As long as the son of Jesse is alive on the earth, you and your kingship will not be firmly established. So now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die.\"\n32 However, Jonathan said to Saul his father: \"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?\" 33 At that Saul hurled the spear at him to strike him, so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. 34 Jonathan immediately rose up from the table in the heat of anger, and he did not eat any food on the second day after the new moon, for he was upset over David and his own father had humiliated him.\n35 In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a young attendant was with him. 36 And he said to his attendant: \"Please run and find the arrows that I shoot.\" The attendant ran, and Jonathan shot the arrow beyond him. 37 When the attendant reached the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called out to the attendant: \"Is not the arrow beyond you?\" 38 Jonathan called out to the attendant: \"Hurry! Go quickly! Do not delay!\" And Jonathan's attendant picked up the arrows and came back to his master. 39 The attendant did not understand anything about the matter; only Jonathan and David knew what was meant. 40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his attendant and told him: \"Go, take them to the city.\"\n41 When the attendant left, David rose up from a place nearby that was to the south. Then he fell with his face to the ground and bowed three times, and they kissed each other and wept for each other, but David wept the most. 42 Jonathan said to David: \"Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of Jehovah, saying, 'May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever.'\"\nThen David rose up and left, and Jonathan went back to the city.\nChapter 21\n1 David later came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech began to tremble when he met David, and he said to him: \"Why are you by yourself and no one is with you?\" 2 David replied to Ahimelech the priest: \"The king instructed me to do something, but he said, 'Do not let anyone know anything about the mission on which I am sending you and about the instructions I have given you.' I made an appointment with my young men to meet at a certain place. 3 Now if there are five loaves of bread at your disposal, just give them to me, or whatever is available.\" 4 But the priest answered David: \"There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is holy bread-provided that the young men have kept away from women.\" 5 David answered the priest: \"Women have certainly been kept away from us as on previous occasions when I went out on a campaign. If the bodies of the young men are holy even when the mission is ordinary, how much more so today should they be holy!\" 6 So the priest gave him the holy bread, because there was no bread there except the showbread, which had been removed from Jehovah's presence to be replaced by fresh bread on the day it was taken away.\n7 Now one of Saul's servants was there on that day, detained before Jehovah. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's shepherds.\n8 David then said to Ahimelech: \"Is there a spear or a sword here at your disposal? I did not take my own sword or my weapons with me, because the king's mission was urgent.\" 9 To this the priest said: \"The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah, is here, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, take it, because it is the only one here.\" David said: \"There is none like it. Give it to me.\"\n10 That day David rose up and continued his flight from Saul, and he eventually came to King Achish of Gath. 11 The servants of Achish said to him: \"Is this not David, the king of the land? Is he not the one they sang about when they danced, saying,\n'Saul has struck down his thousands,\nAnd David his tens of thousands'?\"\n12 David took these words to heart, and he became very much afraid of King Achish of Gath. 13 So he disguised his sanity in their presence and acted insane while among them. He was making marks on the doors of the gate and letting his saliva run down his beard. 14 Finally Achish said to his servants: \"You see that this man is crazy! Why bring him to me? 15 Do I have a shortage of crazy men that I need to have this one acting crazy before me? Should this man enter my house?\"\nChapter 22\n1 So David went from there, escaping to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's entire house heard of it, they went down there to him. 2 And all those who were in trouble and in debt and who had a grievance gathered to him, and he became their chief. There were about 400 men with him.\n3 David later went from there to Mizpeh in Moab and said to the king of Moab: \"Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.\" 4 So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time that David was in the stronghold.\n5 In time Gad the prophet said to David: \"Do not stay in the stronghold. Go from there into the land of Judah.\" So David left and went into the forest of Hereth.\n6 Saul heard that David and the men with him had been found. Saul was then sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were stationed around him. 7 Then Saul said to his servants stationed around him: \"Listen, please, you Benjaminites. Will the son of Jesse also give fields and vineyards to all of you? Will he appoint all of you as chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds? 8 All of you have conspired against me! No one informed me when my own son made a covenant with the son of Jesse! Not one of you has sympathy for me and informs me that my own son has incited my own servant against me to ambush me, as is now the case.\"\n9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was stationed there over the servants of Saul, answered: \"I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 10 And he inquired of Jehovah for him and gave him provisions. He even gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\" 11 At once the king sent for Ahimelech son of Ahitub the priest and all the priests of his father's house, who were in Nob. So all of them came to the king.\n12 Saul now said: \"Listen, please, you son of Ahitub!\" to which he replied: \"Here I am, my lord.\" 13 Saul said to him: \"Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, by giving him bread and a sword and by making an inquiry of God for him? He opposes me and waits in ambush, as is now the case.\" 14 At this Ahimelech answered the king: \"Who among all your servants is as trustworthy as David? He is the king's son-in-law and a chief over your bodyguard and honored in your house. 15 Was today the first time I inquired of God for him? What you are saying is unthinkable on my part! Do not let the king hold anything against his servant and against my father's entire house, for your servant did not know a single thing about any of this.\"\n16 But the king said: \"You will surely die, Ahimelech, you along with all your father's house.\" 17 With that the king said to the guards stationed around him: \"Turn and kill the priests of Jehovah, because they have sided with David! They knew that he was a runaway, and they did not inform me!\" But the king's servants did not want to lift their hands to assault the priests of Jehovah. 18 Then the king said to Doeg: \"You turn and assault the priests!\" Immediately Doeg the Edomite went and assaulted the priests himself. He killed on that day 85 men wearing the linen ephod. 19 He also struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword; man as well as woman, child as well as infant, bull, donkey, and sheep, he put to the sword.\n20 However, one son of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and ran away to follow David. 21 Abiathar told David: \"Saul has killed the priests of Jehovah.\" 22 At this David said to Abiathar: \"I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would be sure to tell Saul. I am personally responsible for the death of everyone in your father's house. 23 Stay with me. Do not be afraid, for whoever seeks your life seeks my life; you are under my protection.\"\nChapter 23\n1 In time David was told: \"The Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are raiding the threshing floors.\" 2 So David inquired of Jehovah: \"Should I go and strike down these Philistines?\" Jehovah said to David: \"Go, strike down the Philistines and rescue Keilah.\" 3 But the men of David said to him: \"Look! We are afraid while here in Judah; how much more so if we go to Keilah against the battle line of the Philistines!\" 4 So David inquired once again of Jehovah. Jehovah now answered him: \"Rise up; go down to Keilah because I will give the Philistines into your hand.\" 5 So David went with his men to Keilah and fought against the Philistines; he carried off their livestock and struck them down with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.\n6 Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech ran away to David at Keilah, he had an ephod with him. 7 Saul was told: \"David has come to Keilah.\" Then Saul said: \"God has handed him over to me, for he has trapped himself by entering a city with gates and bars.\" 8 So Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men. 9 When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest: \"Bring the ephod here.\" 10 Then David said: \"O Jehovah the God of Israel, your servant has indeed heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me. 11 Will the leaders of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Jehovah the God of Israel, please tell your servant.\" To this Jehovah said: \"He will come down.\" 12 David asked: \"Will the leaders of Keilah surrender me and my men into Saul's hand?\" Jehovah replied: \"They will surrender you.\"\n13 At once David rose up with his men, about 600 in number, and they left Keilah and moved about wherever they could. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go out after him. 14 David stayed in the wilderness in places difficult to approach, in the mountainous region of the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him constantly, but Jehovah did not give him into his hand. 15 David was aware that Saul had gone out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.\n16 Jonathan the son of Saul now went out to David at Horesh, and he helped him find strength in Jehovah. 17 He said to him: \"Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will not find you; you will be king over Israel, and I will become second to you; and my father Saul also knows that.\" 18 Then the two of them made a covenant before Jehovah, and David stayed in Horesh, and Jonathan went to his home.\n19 The men of Ziph later went up to Saul at Gibeah and said: \"Is not David hiding near us in the places difficult to approach at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 20 Whenever it pleases you to come down, O king, come, and we will surrender him into the hand of the king.\" 21 At this Saul said: \"May you be blessed by Jehovah, for you have shown compassion to me. 22 Please go and try to find out exactly where he is and who saw him there, for I have been told that he is very cunning. 23 Carefully ascertain where all his hiding places are and return to me with the evidence. I will then go with you, and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.\"\n24 So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul, while David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon. 25 Then Saul came with his men to look for him. When David was told, he at once went down to the crag and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he chased after David into the wilderness of Maon. 26 As Saul came to one side of the mountain, David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. 27 But a messenger came to Saul, saying: \"Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!\" 28 At that Saul stopped chasing after David and went to confront the Philistines. That is why that place was named the Crag of the Divisions.\n29 Then David made his way up from there and stayed in the places difficult to approach at En-gedi.\nChapter 24\n1 As soon as Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him: \"Look! David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.\"\n2 So Saul took 3,000 men chosen from all Israel and went to look for David and his men on the rocky cliffs of the mountain goats. 3 Saul came to the stone sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself while David and his men were sitting in the recesses at the back of the cave. 4 David's men said to him: \"This is the day on which Jehovah is saying to you, 'Look! I am giving your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.'\" So David rose up and quietly cut off the edge of Saul's sleeveless coat. 5 But afterward David's heart kept striking him because he had cut off the edge of Saul's sleeveless coat. 6 He said to his men: \"It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint that I should do such a thing to my lord, the anointed of Jehovah, by lifting my hand against him, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.\" 7 So David restrained his men with these words, and he did not allow them to attack Saul. As for Saul, he rose up from the cave and went on his way.\n8 Then David got up and went out from the cave and called out after Saul: \"My lord the king!\" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself. 9 David said to Saul: \"Why do you listen to the words of men who say, 'Look! David is seeking to harm you'? 10 This very day your own eyes have seen how Jehovah gave you into my hand in the cave. But when someone said to kill you, I had pity on you and said, 'I will not lift my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.' 11 And look, my father, yes, see the edge of your sleeveless coat in my hand; for when I cut off the edge of your sleeveless coat, I did not kill you. You can now see and understand that I do not intend to harm you or to rebel, and I have not sinned against you, whereas you are hunting me down to take my life. 12 May Jehovah judge between you and me, and may Jehovah take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will not come against you. 13 Just as the ancient proverb says, 'From the wicked comes wickedness,' but my hand will not come against you. 14 After whom has the king of Israel gone out? Whom are you chasing? A dead dog? A single flea? 15 May Jehovah be the judge, and he will judge between you and me, and he will see and will plead my case and judge me and rescue me from your hand.\"\n16 At the moment that David finished speaking these words to him, Saul said: \"Is this your voice, my son David?\" And Saul began to weep loudly. 17 He said to David: \"You are more righteous than I am, for you have treated me well and I have repaid you with evil. 18 Yes, today you have told me of the good you did by not killing me when Jehovah surrendered me into your hand. 19 For what man finds his enemy and sends him on his way unharmed? Jehovah will reward you with good because of what you have done for me today. 20 And now look! I know that you will surely rule as king and that in your hand the kingdom of Israel will endure. 21 Now swear to me by Jehovah that you will not wipe out my descendants after me and that you will not annihilate my name out of my father's house.\" 22 So David swore to Saul, after which Saul went home. But David and his men went up to the stronghold.\nChapter 25\n1 In time Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together to mourn for him and to bury him at his house in Ramah. Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.\n2 Now there was a man in Maon whose work was in Carmel. The man was very wealthy; he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, and he was then shearing his sheep at Carmel. 3 The man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. The wife was discerning and beautiful, but the husband, a Calebite, was harsh, and he behaved badly. 4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 5 So David sent ten young men to him, and David told the young men: \"Go up to Carmel, and when you come to Nabal, ask him in my name about his welfare. 6 Then say, 'May you live long and may you be well and may your household be well and may all that you have be well. 7 Now I hear that you are doing your shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harm them, and they found nothing missing the whole time they were in Carmel. 8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. May my young men find favor in your eyes, because we have come at a joyous time. Please give to your servants and to your son David whatever you can spare.'\"\n9 So David's young men went and told all of this to Nabal in David's name. When they finished, 10 Nabal answered David's servants: \"Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays many servants are breaking away from their masters. 11 Do I have to take my bread and my water and the meat that I butchered for my shearers and give it to men who come from who knows where?\"\n12 At that David's young men returned and reported all these words to him. 13 David immediately said to his men: \"Everyone strap on your sword!\" So they all strapped on their swords, and David also strapped on his own sword, and about 400 men went up with David, while 200 men stayed with the baggage.\n14 Meanwhile, one of the servants reported to Abigail, Nabal's wife: \"Look! David sent messengers from the wilderness to wish our master well, but he screamed insults at them. 15 Those men were very good to us. They never harmed us, and we did not miss a single thing the whole time we were together with them in the fields. 16 They were like a protective wall around us, both by night and by day, the whole time we were with them shepherding the flock. 17 Now decide what you are going to do, for disaster has been determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.\"\n18 So Abigail quickly took 200 loaves of bread, two large jars of wine, five dressed sheep, five seah measures of roasted grain, 100 cakes of raisins, and 200 cakes of pressed figs and put all of it on the donkeys. 19 Then she said to her servants: \"Go on ahead of me; I will follow you.\" But she said nothing to her husband Nabal.\n20 While she was riding on the donkey and going down under cover of the mountain, just then David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them. 21 Now David had been saying: \"It was for nothing that I guarded everything that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness. Not a single thing belonging to him went missing, and yet he repays me evil for good. 22 May God do the same and more to the enemies of David if I allow a single male of his to survive until the morning.\"\n23 When Abigail caught sight of David, she hurried down off the donkey and threw herself facedown before David, bowing to the ground. 24 She then fell at his feet and said: \"My lord, let the blame be on me; let your servant girl speak to you, and listen to the words of your servant girl. 25 Please, do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless Nabal, for he is just like his name. Nabal is his name, and senselessness is with him. But I, your servant girl, did not see my lord's young men whom you sent. 26 And now, my lord, as surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living, it is Jehovah who has held you back from incurring bloodguilt and from taking revenge with your own hand. May your enemies and those seeking injury to my lord become like Nabal. 27 Now let this gift that your servant girl has brought to my lord be given to the young men who are following my lord. 28 Pardon, please, the transgression of your servant girl, for Jehovah will without fail make for my lord a lasting house, because my lord is fighting the wars of Jehovah, and no evil has been found in you all your days. 29 When someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life, the life of my lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of life with Jehovah your God, but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away like stones from a sling. 30 And when Jehovah has done for my lord all the good things he has promised and he appoints you as leader over Israel, 31 you will have no remorse or regret in your heart for shedding blood without cause and for letting the hand of my lord take revenge. When Jehovah confers good upon my lord, remember your servant girl.\"\n32 At this David said to Abigail: \"Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 And blessed be your good sense! May you be blessed for restraining me this day from incurring bloodguilt and from taking revenge with my own hands. 34 Otherwise, as surely as Jehovah the God of Israel who held me back from harming you is living, if you had not come quickly to meet me, by morning there would not have remained a single male belonging to Nabal.\" 35 With that David accepted from her what she had brought him and said to her: \"Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to you, and I will grant your request.\"\n36 Abigail later went back to Nabal, who was feasting like a king in his house, and Nabal was in a good mood and was as drunk as could be. She did not tell him a single thing until the morning light. 37 In the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him these things. And his heart became like a dead man's, and he lay paralyzed like a stone. 38 About ten days later, Jehovah struck Nabal, and he died.\n39 When David heard that Nabal had died, he said: \"Praise Jehovah, who has pleaded my case of reproach from Nabal and has kept his servant from doing anything bad, and Jehovah has brought the badness of Nabal back on his own head!\" Then David sent word to propose to Abigail to take her as his wife. 40 So David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel and said to her: \"David has sent us to you to take you as his wife.\" 41 She immediately rose up and bowed with her face to the ground and said: \"Here is your slave as a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.\" 42 Then Abigail quickly rose up and rode on her donkey with five of her female servants walking behind her; she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife.\n43 David had also married Ahinoam from Jezreel, and both women became his wives.\n44 But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.\nChapter 26\n1 In time the men of Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah, saying: \"Is David not hiding on the hill of Hachilah facing Jeshimon?\" 2 So Saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with 3,000 chosen men of Israel to look for David in the wilderness of Ziph. 3 Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which faces Jeshimon, by the road. David was then living in the wilderness, and he learned that Saul had come into the wilderness after him. 4 So David sent spies to verify that Saul had indeed come. 5 David later went to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul and Abner the son of Ner, the chief of his army, were lying asleep; Saul lay asleep in the camp enclosure with the troops camping all around him. 6 Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab: \"Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?\" Abishai replied: \"I will go down with you.\" 7 So David and Abishai made their way to the troops by night, and they found Saul lying asleep in the camp enclosure with his spear stuck into the ground next to his head; Abner and the troops were lying all around him.\n8 Abishai now said to David: \"Today God has surrendered your enemy into your hand. And now, please, let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once, and I will not need to do it twice.\" 9 However, David said to Abishai: \"Do not harm him, for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent?\" 10 David continued: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, Jehovah himself will strike him down, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and perish. 11 It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah! So now take, please, the spear next to his head and the water jug, and let us be on our way.\" 12 So David took the spear and the water jug from next to Saul's head, and they went away. No one saw or noticed them or woke up, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them. 13 Then David crossed to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain some distance away, with a considerable space between them.\n14 David called out to the troops and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: \"Abner, will you not answer?\" Abner answered: \"Who are you who calls to the king?\" 15 David said to Abner: \"Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? So why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the soldiers came in to do away with your lord the king. 16 What you have done is not good. As surely as Jehovah is living, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the anointed of Jehovah. Now look around! Where are the king's spear and the water jug that were next to his head?\"\n17 Then Saul recognized the voice of David and said: \"Is this your voice, my son David?\" David replied: \"It is my voice, my lord the king.\" 18 He added: \"Why is my lord chasing after his servant, for what have I done, and what am I guilty of? 19 My lord the king, please, listen to the words of his servant: If it is Jehovah who incited you against me, let him accept my grain offering. But if men have incited you, they are cursed before Jehovah, because they have driven me away today from being united with Jehovah's inheritance, saying, 'Go, serve other gods!' 20 And now do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of Jehovah, for the king of Israel has gone out to look for a single flea, as if he were chasing a partridge on the mountains.\"\n21 In turn Saul said: \"I have sinned. Come back, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because you regarded my life as precious this day. Yes, I have acted foolishly and have made a terrible mistake.\" 22 David answered: \"Here is the spear of the king. Let one of the young men come over and take it. 23 It is Jehovah who will repay each one for his own righteousness and his own faithfulness, for today Jehovah gave you into my hand, but I was unwilling to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah. 24 Look! Just as your life was precious to me this day, so may my life be precious in the eyes of Jehovah, and may he rescue me out of all distress.\" 25 Saul replied to David: \"May you be blessed, my son David. You will surely do great things, and you will surely prevail.\" Then David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.\nChapter 27\n1 However, David said in his heart: \"One day I will perish by Saul's hand. The best thing for me is to escape to the land of the Philistines; then Saul will give up looking for me in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.\" 2 So David rose up with the 600 men who were with him and went over to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath. 3 David stayed with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each man with his household. With David were his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal's widow. 4 When report was made to Saul that David had run away to Gath, he stopped searching for him.\n5 Then David said to Achish: \"If I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities of the countryside, so that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?\" 6 So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. That is why Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah down to this day.\n7 The length of time that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines was a year and four months. 8 David would go up with his men to raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for they were inhabiting the land that extended from Telam as far as Shur and down to the land of Egypt. 9 When David would attack the land, he preserved neither man nor woman alive, but he took the flocks, herds, donkeys, camels, and clothing, after which he would return to Achish. 10 Then Achish would ask: \"Where did you make a raid today?\" David would reply: \"Against the south of Judah\" or \"Against the south of the Jerahmeelites\" or \"Against the south of the Kenites.\" 11 David did not spare alive any man or woman to be brought to Gath, saying: \"That they may not tell them about us and say, 'This is what David did.'\" (And that was his practice the whole time he lived in the countryside of the Philistines.) 12 So Achish believed David, saying to himself: 'He has certainly become a stench among his people Israel, so he will always be my servant.'\nChapter 28\n1 In those days the Philistines assembled their armies for war against Israel. So Achish said to David: \"You know, of course, that you and your men will go out into battle with me.\" 2 At that David said to Achish: \"You surely know what your servant will do.\" Achish said to David: \"That is why I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard.\"\n3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned him and had buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the spirit mediums and the fortune-tellers from the land.\n4 The Philistines assembled and went and set up camp in Shunem. So Saul assembled all Israel, and they set up camp in Gilboa. 5 When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 6 Although Saul would inquire of Jehovah, Jehovah never answered him, either in dreams or by the Urim or through the prophets. 7 Finally Saul said to his servants: \"Find me a woman who is a spirit medium, and I will go and consult her.\" His servants replied: \"Look! There is a woman who is a spirit medium in En-dor.\"\n8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went to the woman by night with two of his men. He said: \"Use divination, please, by acting as a spirit medium, and bring up for me the one whom I designate to you.\" 9 However, the woman said to him: \"You must know what Saul did, how he removed the spirit mediums and the fortune-tellers from the land. Why, then, are you trying to trap me to have me put to death?\" 10 Saul then swore to her by Jehovah, saying: \"As surely as Jehovah is alive, you will not incur any guilt in this matter!\" 11 At this the woman said: \"Whom should I bring up for you?\" He replied: \"Bring up Samuel for me.\" 12 When the woman saw \"Samuel,\" she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul: \"Why did you trick me? You are Saul!\" 13 The king said to her: \"Do not be afraid, but what do you see?\" The woman replied to Saul: \"I see one like a god coming up out of the earth.\" 14 At once he asked her: \"What does he look like?\" to which she said: \"It is an old man coming up, and he is clothed in a sleeveless coat.\" At that Saul realized that it was \"Samuel,\" and he bowed low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.\n15 Then \"Samuel\" said to Saul: \"Why have you disturbed me by having me brought up?\" Saul replied: \"I am in great trouble. The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me and no longer answers me, either through the prophets or in dreams; so that is why I am calling on you to let me know what I should do.\"\n16 And \"Samuel\" said: \"Why do you inquire of me now that Jehovah has departed from you and has become your adversary? 17 Jehovah will do for himself what he foretold through me: Jehovah will rip the kingdom out of your hands and give it to one of your fellow men, David. 18 Because you did not obey the voice of Jehovah and you did not execute his burning anger against the Amalekites, that is why Jehovah is doing this to you this day. 19 Jehovah will also give both Israel and you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. Jehovah will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.\"\n20 At once Saul fell full length on the ground and became very much afraid because of \"Samuel's\" words. And there was no strength left in him, because he had not eaten food all day and all night. 21 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he had been greatly disturbed, she said to him: \"Here your servant has obeyed what you said, and I risked my life and did what you told me to do. 22 Now, please, listen to what your servant has to say. Let me set before you a piece of bread; then eat so that you will have some strength to go on your way.\" 23 But he refused and said: \"I am not going to eat.\" However, his servants and also the woman kept urging him. Finally he listened to them and got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 24 The woman had a fattened calf in the house, so she quickly slaughtered it and took flour and kneaded dough and baked it into unleavened bread. 25 She served them to Saul and his servants, and they ate. After that they rose up and left during the night.\nChapter 29\n1 The Philistines assembled all their armies at Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring in Jezreel. 2 And the lords of the Philistines were passing by with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish. 3 But the princes of the Philistines said: \"Why are these Hebrews here?\" Achish replied to the princes of the Philistines: \"This is David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me for a year or more. I have not found any fault in him from the day he deserted to me until today.\" 4 But the princes of the Philistines became indignant at him, and they said to him: \"Make the man go back. Let him return to the place where you assigned him. Do not let him go down with us into the battle, so that he will not turn against us during the battle. For what better way to put himself in favor with his lord than with the heads of our men? 5 Is this not the David about whom they sang when they danced, saying:\n'Saul has struck down his thousands,\nAnd David his tens of thousands'?\"\n6 So Achish summoned David and said to him: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, you are upright, and I am pleased to have you go on the campaign with my army, for I have not found any fault with you from the day you came to me until today. But the lords do not trust you. 7 So return in peace, and do not do anything to displease the lords of the Philistines.\" 8 However, David said to Achish: \"Why, what have I done? What fault have you found in your servant from the day that I came to you until today? Why should I not come with you and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\" 9 Achish answered David: \"From my standpoint, you have been as good as an angel of God. But the princes of the Philistines have said, 'Do not let him go up with us into the battle.' 10 Now get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you; rise up and leave early in the morning as soon as it is light.\"\n11 So David and his men rose up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.\nChapter 30\n1 When David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had made a raid on the south and on Ziklag, and they had attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire. 2 They had taken captive the women and all who were in it, from the smallest to the greatest. They had not killed anyone, but they had carried them off and gone on their way. 3 When David and his men came to the city, they found it burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been carried off captive. 4 So David and the men with him began weeping loudly until they had no strength left to weep. 5 David's two wives had also been carried off captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 6 David was very distressed, because the men were talking of stoning him, for all the men had become very bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself by Jehovah his God.\n7 David then said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech: \"Please bring the ephod here.\" So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 8 David inquired of Jehovah: \"Should I chase after this marauder band? Will I overtake them?\" At this He said to him: \"Go in pursuit, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will make the rescue.\"\n9 David immediately set out with the 600 men who were with him, and they went on as far as the Wadi Besor, where some of the men stayed behind. 10 David kept up the chase with 400 men, but the 200 men who were too tired to cross the Wadi Besor stayed behind.\n11 They found an Egyptian man in the field and took him to David. They gave him food to eat and water to drink, 12 as well as a slice of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. After he ate, he regained his strength, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights. 13 David now asked him: \"To whom do you belong, and where are you from?\" to which he said: \"I am an Egyptian attendant, a slave of an Amalekite man, but my master left me because I got sick three days ago. 14 We made a raid on the south of the Cherethites and on the territory of Judah and on the south of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned with fire.\" 15 At this David said to him: \"Will you lead me down to this marauder band?\" He replied: \"If you swear to me by God that you will not put me to death and that you will not hand me over to my master, I will lead you down to this marauder band.\"\n16 So he led him down to where they were spread out all over the land, eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and the land of Judah. 17 Then David struck them down from the morning darkness until the following evening; not a man escaped except 400 men who fled on camels. 18 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives. 19 Nothing of theirs was missing, from the smallest to the greatest. They recovered their sons and daughters and the spoil; David recovered everything that they had taken. 20 So David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before their own livestock. They said: \"This is David's spoil.\"\n21 Then David came to the 200 men who had been too tired to go along with David and who had stayed behind by the Wadi Besor, and they came out to meet David and the people with him. When David came near to the men, he asked them how they were. 22 However, every bad and worthless man among those who had gone with David said: \"Since they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we recovered except that each one may take his wife and his sons and go away.\" 23 But David said: \"You must not do this, my brothers, with what Jehovah has given us. He protected us and gave into our hand the marauder band that came against us. 24 Who would agree with you on this? The share of the one who went down into the battle will be the same as the share of the one who sat by the baggage. All will have a share together.\" 25 And from that day forward, he kept it set as a regulation and a rule for Israel down to this day.\n26 When David returned to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah who were his friends, saying: \"Here is a gift for you from the spoil of Jehovah's enemies.\" 27 He sent it to those who were in Bethel, to those in Ramoth of the Negeb, to those in Jattir, 28 to those in Aroer, to those in Siphmoth, to those in Eshtemoa, 29 to those in Racal, to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those in the cities of the Kenites, 30 to those in Hormah, to those in Borashan, to those in Athach, 31 to those in Hebron, and to all the places that David and his men had frequented.\nChapter 31\n1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. And the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 2 The Philistines kept in close range of Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons. 3 The fighting grew fierce against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was severely wounded by the archers. 4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer: \"Draw your sword and run me through with it, so that these uncircumcised men may not come and run me through and deal ruthlessly with me.\" But his armor-bearer was unwilling, because he was very much afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died with him. 6 Thus Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together on that day. 7 When the people of Israel who were in the region of the valley and in the region of the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they began to abandon the cities and flee; the Philistines then came and occupied them.\n8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 9 So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the news in the houses of their idols and among the people. 10 Then they put his armor in the house of the Ashtoreth images and fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth-shan. 11 When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 12 all the warriors rose and traveled all night and took the bodies of Saul and his sons off the wall of Beth-shan. They returned to Jabesh and burned them there. 13 Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.\n",

    "text": "Second Samuel\nChapter 1\n1 After Saul's death, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, David stayed at Ziklag for two days. 2 On the third day, a man came from the camp of Saul with his garments ripped apart and dirt on his head. When he approached David, he fell down to the ground and prostrated himself.\n3 David asked him: \"Where are you coming from?\" He replied: \"I have escaped from the camp of Israel.\" 4 David asked him: \"How did things turn out? Please tell me.\" To this he said: \"The people have fled from the battle and many have fallen and died. Even Saul and his son Jonathan have died.\" 5 Then David asked the young man who brought him the news: \"How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\" 6 The young man replied: \"By chance I was on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul supporting himself on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen had caught up with him. 7 When he turned around and saw me, he called me, and I said, 'Here I am!' 8 He asked me, 'Who are you?' I replied, 'I am an Amalekite.' 9 Then he said, 'Please stand over me and put me to death, for I am in great agony, but I am still alive.' 10 So I stood over him and put him to death, for I knew that he could not survive after he had fallen down wounded. Then I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and I brought them here to my lord.\"\n11 At this David took hold of his garments and ripped them apart, and so did all the men who were with him. 12 And they wailed and wept and fasted until evening for Saul, for his son Jonathan, for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.\n13 David asked the young man who brought him the news: \"Where are you from?\" He said: \"I am the son of a foreign resident, an Amalekite.\" 14 Then David said to him: \"Why did you not fear to lift your hand to do away with the anointed of Jehovah?\" 15 With that David called one of the young men and said: \"Step forward and strike him.\" So he struck him down, and he died. 16 David said to him: \"Your blood is on your own head, because your own mouth testified against you by saying, 'I myself put the anointed of Jehovah to death.'\"\n17 Then David chanted this dirge over Saul and his son Jonathan 18 and said that the people of Judah should be taught the dirge called \"The Bow,\" which is written in the book of Jashar:\n19 \"The beauty, O Israel, lies slain upon your high places.\nHow the mighty have fallen!\n20 Do not tell it in Gath;\nDo not announce it in the streets of Ashkelon,\nOr the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,\nOr the daughters of the uncircumcised men will exult.\n21 You mountains of Gilboa,\nMay there be no dew or rain upon you,\nNor fields producing holy contributions,\nBecause there the shield of mighty ones was defiled,\nThe shield of Saul is no longer anointed with oil.\n22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of mighty ones,\nThe bow of Jonathan did not turn back,\nAnd the sword of Saul would not return without success.\n23 Saul and Jonathan, beloved and cherished during their life,\nAnd in death they were not separated.\nSwifter than the eagles they were,\nMightier than the lions.\n24 O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\nWho clothed you in scarlet and finery,\nWho put gold ornaments upon your clothing.\n25 How the mighty have fallen in battle!\nJonathan lies slain upon your high places!\n26 I am distressed over you, my brother Jonathan;\nYou were very dear to me.\nMore wonderful was your love to me than the love of women.\n27 How the mighty have fallen\nAnd the weapons of war have perished!\"\nChapter 2\n1 Afterward David inquired of Jehovah, saying: \"Should I go up into one of the cities of Judah?\" Jehovah said to him: \"Go up.\" David then asked: \"Where should I go?\" He replied: \"To Hebron.\" 2 So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 3 David also brought the men who were with him, each with his household, and they settled in the cities around Hebron. 4 Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David as king over the house of Judah.\nThey told David: \"The men of Jabesh-gilead were the ones who buried Saul.\" 5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them: \"May you be blessed by Jehovah, because you showed loyal love to your lord Saul by burying him. 6 May Jehovah show loyal love and faithfulness to you. I will also show you kindness because you have done this. 7 Now let your hands be strong and be courageous men, for your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.\"\n8 But Abner the son of Ner, the chief of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth and brought him across to Mahanaim 9 and made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and over all Israel. 10 Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was 40 years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned for two years. The house of Judah, however, supported David. 11 The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\n12 In time Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 13 Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and encountered them at the pool of Gibeon; and one group sat on this side of the pool, and the other group on that side of the pool. 14 Finally Abner said to Joab: \"Let the young men get up and engage in combat before us.\" To this Joab said: \"Let them get up.\" 15 So they got up and crossed over by number, 12 for Benjamin and Saul's son Ish-bosheth and 12 from the servants of David. 16 They grabbed one another by the head and each of them thrust his sword into the side of his opponent, and they all fell down together. So that place, which is in Gibeon, was called Helkath-hazzurim.\n17 The fighting that ensued was extremely fierce that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were finally defeated before the servants of David. 18 Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there-Joab, Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as swift on his feet as a gazelle in the open field. 19 Asahel chased after Abner, and he would not veer to the right or to the left in his pursuit of Abner. 20 When Abner looked behind, he asked, \"Is that you, Asahel?\" to which he replied, \"Yes, it is.\" 21 Then Abner said to him: \"Veer to your right or to your left and capture one of the young men, and take whatever you strip off him for yourself.\" But Asahel did not want to stop chasing him. 22 So Abner said to Asahel once again: \"Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?\" 23 But he kept refusing to stop, so Abner struck him in the abdomen with the butt end of the spear, and the spear came out from his back; and he fell there and died on the spot. Everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell and died would stop and pause there.\n24 Then Joab and Abishai went in pursuit of Abner. As the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, which faces Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 25 And the Benjaminites gathered together behind Abner, and they formed one company and made a stand on the top of a certain hill. 26 Then Abner called out to Joab: \"Is the sword going to devour endlessly? Do you not know that the outcome will only be bitterness? How long, then, will it be before you tell the people to turn back from pursuing their brothers?\" 27 At that Joab said: \"As surely as the true God is living, if you had not spoken, then only by the morning would the people have stopped pursuing their brothers.\" 28 Joab now blew the horn, and his men stopped chasing after Israel, and the fighting ceased.\n29 Abner and his men then marched through the Arabah all that night and crossed the Jordan and marched through the entire ravine and finally came to Mahanaim. 30 After Joab turned back from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the people together. Of David's servants, 19 were missing, in addition to Asahel. 31 But the servants of David had defeated the Benjaminites and the men of Abner, and 360 of their men had died. 32 They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb, which is at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night long, and they reached Hebron at daybreak.\nChapter 3\n1 The war between the house of Saul and the house of David dragged on; and David kept getting stronger, and the house of Saul grew steadily weaker.\n2 Meanwhile, sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam of Jezreel. 3 His second was Chileab by Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third was Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur. 4 The fourth was Adonijah the son of Haggith, and the fifth was Shephatiah the son of Abital. 5 The sixth was Ithream by David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.\n6 While the war between the house of Saul and the house of David continued, Abner kept strengthening his position in the house of Saul. 7 Now Saul had had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth later said to Abner: \"Why did you have relations with the concubine of my father?\" 8 Abner grew very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said: \"Am I a dog's head from Judah? Until this very day, I have shown loyal love toward the house of your father Saul and to his brothers and his friends, and I have not betrayed you into the hand of David; yet today you call me to account for an error concerning a woman. 9 May God do so to Abner and add to it if I do not do for David just as Jehovah swore to him: 10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.\" 11 He was not able to say one more word in reply to Abner, for he was afraid of him.\n12 Abner immediately sent messengers to David, saying: \"To whom does the land belong?\" He added: \"Make a covenant with me, and I will do whatever I can to turn all Israel to your side.\" 13 To this he replied: \"Good! I will make a covenant with you. The only thing I ask of you is that you do not try to see my face unless first you bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me.\" 14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying: \"Give me my wife Michal, to whom I became engaged for 100 foreskins of the Philistines.\" 15 So Ish-bosheth sent to take her from her husband, Paltiel the son of Laish. 16 But her husband kept walking with her, weeping as he followed her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him: \"Go, return!\" At that he returned.\n17 Meanwhile, Abner sent word to the elders of Israel, saying: \"For some time you wanted to have David as king over you. 18 Now act, for Jehovah said to David: 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'\" 19 Then Abner spoke to the people of Benjamin. Abner also went to speak privately to David at Hebron to tell him what Israel and the whole house of Benjamin had agreed upon.\n20 When Abner came to David at Hebron with 20 men, David held a feast for Abner and for the men with him. 21 Then Abner said to David: \"Let me go and gather all Israel together to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and you will become king over all that you desire.\" So David sent Abner off, and he went his way in peace.\n22 Just then, David's servants and Joab returned from a raid, bringing a great quantity of spoil back with them. Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for he had sent him on his way in peace. 23 When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, Joab was told: \"Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him off, and he went his way in peace.\" 24 So Joab went in to the king and said: \"What have you done? Here Abner came to you. Why did you send him off so that he successfully got away? 25 You know Abner the son of Ner! He came here to fool you and to get to know your every move and to find out everything that you are doing.\"\n26 So Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know anything about it. 27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside inside the gate to speak with him privately. However, there he stabbed him in the abdomen, and he died; this was for killing his brother Asahel. 28 When David heard about it later, he said: \"I and my kingdom are forever innocent before Jehovah of the bloodguilt for Abner the son of Ner. 29 May it turn back on the head of Joab and on the entire house of his father. May Joab's house never be without a man suffering from a discharge or a leper or a man working at the spindle or one falling by the sword or one in need of food!\" 30 So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put Asahel their brother to death in the battle at Gibeon.\n31 Then David said to Joab and all the people with him: \"Rip your garments apart and tie on sackcloth and wail over Abner.\" King David himself was walking behind the funeral bier. 32 They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king wept loudly at Abner's tomb, and all the people gave way to weeping. 33 The king chanted over Abner and said:\n\"Should Abner die the death of a senseless person?\n34 Your hands had not been bound,\nAnd your feet were not in fetters.\nYou fell like one falling before criminals.\"\nAt that all the people wept over him again.\n35 Later all the people came to give David bread for consolation while it was still daytime, but David swore: \"May God do so to me and add to it if before the sun sets I taste bread or anything at all!\" 36 All the people took notice, and it pleased them. Like everything that the king did, it pleased all the people. 37 So all the people and all Israel knew on that day that the king was not responsible for having Abner the son of Ner put to death. 38 Then the king said to his servants: \"Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? 39 Today I am weak, although anointed as king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too brutal for me. May Jehovah repay the evildoer according to his own evil.\"\nChapter 4\n1 When Saul's son Ish-bosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed him and all the Israelites were disturbed. 2 There were two men in charge of the marauder bands that belonged to the son of Saul: one was named Baanah and the other Rechab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin. (For Beeroth too used to be counted as part of Benjamin. 3 The Beerothites ran away to Gittaim, and they are foreign residents there down to this day.)\n4 Now Saul's son Jonathan had a son whose feet were crippled. He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was fleeing in panic, he fell and was crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.\n5 The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went to the house of Ish-bosheth during the hot part of the day, as he was taking his midday rest. 6 They went into the house as if they were getting wheat, and they struck him in the abdomen; then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. 7 When they had entered the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom, and they struck him and put him to death, after which they cut off his head. Then they took his head and walked all night long on the road to the Arabah. 8 And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king: \"Here is the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul your enemy who sought your life. This day Jehovah gives to my lord the king revenge on Saul and his descendants.\"\n9 However, David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, the one who rescued me out of all distress, 10 when someone reported to me, 'Here Saul is dead,' and he thought he was bringing me good news, I took hold of him and killed him in Ziklag. That was the messenger's reward he received from me! 11 How much more so when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed! Should I not require his blood from your hands and rid the earth of you?\" 12 David then ordered the young men to kill them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it in the burial place of Abner in Hebron.\nChapter 5\n1 In time all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said: \"Look! We are your own bone and flesh. 2 In times past while Saul was our king, you were the one who was leading Israel on its campaigns. And Jehovah said to you: 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become leader over Israel.'\" 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah. Then they anointed David as king over Israel.\n4 David was 30 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 40 years. 5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah for 7 years and 6 months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years over all Israel and Judah. 6 And the king and his men set out for Jerusalem against the Jebusites who were inhabiting the land. They taunted David: \"You will never come in here! Even the blind and the lame will drive you away.\" They thought, 'David will never get in here.' 7 However, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the City of David. 8 So David said on that day: \"Those who attack the Jebusites should go through the water tunnel to strike down both 'the lame and the blind,' who are hateful to David!\" That is why it is said: \"The blind and the lame will never enter the house.\" 9 Then David took up residence in the stronghold, and it was called the City of David; and David began to build all around from the Mound inward. 10 Thus David became greater and greater, and Jehovah the God of armies was with him.\n11 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, also cedar timbers, woodworkers, and stonemasons for building walls, and they began to build a house for David. 12 And David knew that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.\n13 David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David. 14 These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.\n17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went down to the stronghold. 18 Then the Philistines came in and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 19 David inquired of Jehovah, saying: \"Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?\" At this Jehovah said to David: \"Go up, for I will surely give the Philistines into your hand.\" 20 So David came to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. At that he said: \"Jehovah has broken through my enemies before me, like a breach made by waters.\" That is why he named that place Baal-perazim. 21 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men took them away.\n22 Later the Philistines came up once again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23 David inquired of Jehovah, but He said: \"Do not go directly up. Instead, go around behind them, and come against them in front of the baca bushes. 24 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baca bushes, then act decisively, for Jehovah will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.\" 25 So David did just as Jehovah commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.\nChapter 6\n1 David again gathered all the best troops in Israel, 30,000 men. 2 Then David and all the men with him set out for Baale-judah to bring up from there the Ark of the true God, before which people call on the name of Jehovah of armies, who sits enthroned above the cherubs. 3 However, they placed the Ark of the true God on a new wagon to transport it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new wagon.\n4 So they transported the Ark of the true God from Abinadab's house on the hill, and Ahio was walking ahead of the Ark. 5 David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before Jehovah with all sorts of juniper-wood instruments, harps, other stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals. 6 But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah thrust his hand out to the Ark of the true God and grabbed hold of it, for the cattle nearly upset it. 7 At that Jehovah's anger blazed against Uzzah, and the true God struck him down there for his irreverent act, and he died there beside the Ark of the true God. 8 But David became angry because Jehovah's wrath had broken through against Uzzah; and that place has been called Perez-uzzah down to this day. 9 So David became fearful of Jehovah on that day and said: \"How can the Ark of Jehovah come to me?\" 10 David was not willing to bring the Ark of Jehovah to where he was in the City of David. Instead, David had it taken to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.\n11 The Ark of Jehovah remained at the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and Jehovah kept blessing Obed-edom and all his household. 12 The report was made to King David: \"Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him because of the Ark of the true God.\" So David went to bring the Ark of the true God from the house of Obed-edom up to the City of David with rejoicing. 13 When the carriers of the Ark of Jehovah had marched six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened animal.\n14 David was dancing around before Jehovah with all his might; all the while David wore a linen ephod. 15 David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the Ark of Jehovah with joyful shouting and with the sound of the horn. 16 But when the Ark of Jehovah came into the City of David, Saul's daughter Michal looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing around before Jehovah; and she began to despise him in her heart. 17 So they brought the Ark of Jehovah in and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered up burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before Jehovah. 18 When David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of armies. 19 Further, he distributed to all the people, to the whole multitude of Israel, to each man and woman, a ring-shaped loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake, and then all the people left, each to his own house.\n20 When David returned to bless his own household, Saul's daughter Michal came out to meet him. She said: \"How glorious the king of Israel made himself when he uncovered himself today before the eyes of the slave girls of his servants, just as an empty-headed man openly uncovers himself!\" 21 At this David said to Michal: \"My celebration was before Jehovah, who chose me rather than your father and all his household and who appointed me as leader over Jehovah's people, Israel. Therefore, I will celebrate before Jehovah, 22 and I will humble myself even more than this and become low even in my own eyes. But by the slave girls whom you mentioned, I will be glorified.\" 23 So Saul's daughter Michal had no children down to the day of her death.\nChapter 7\n1 When the king was settled in his own house and Jehovah had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies, 2 the king said to Nathan the prophet: \"Here I am living in a house of cedars while the Ark of the true God sits in the midst of tent cloths.\" 3 Nathan replied to the king: \"Go and do whatever is in your heart, for Jehovah is with you.\"\n4 On that very night, the word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying: 5 \"Go and say to my servant David, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Should you build me a house to dwell in? 6 For I have not dwelled in a house from the day I brought the people of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent and in a tabernacle. 7 During all the time that I went with all the Israelites, did I ever say one word to any of the tribal leaders of Israel whom I appointed to shepherd my people Israel, saying, 'Why did you not build a house of cedars for me?'\"' 8 Now say this to my servant David, 'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"I took you from the pastures, from following the flock, to become a leader over my people Israel. 9 And I will be with you wherever you go, and I will do away with all your enemies from before you; and I will make a great name for you like the name of the great men of the earth. 10 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and settle them, and they will live there and not be disturbed anymore; and wicked men will not oppress them again as they did in the past, 11 from the day that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies.\n\"'\"Also, Jehovah has told you that Jehovah will make a house for you. 12 When your days come to an end and you are laid to rest with your forefathers, then I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom. 13 He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will firmly establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 14 I will become his father, and he will become my son. When he does wrong, I will reprove him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of men. 15 My loyal love will not be taken away from him the way I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 16 Your house and your kingdom will be secure forever before you; your throne will be firmly established forever.\"'\"\n17 Nathan told David all these words and this entire vision.\n18 At that King David came in and sat down before Jehovah and said: \"Who am I, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah? And what is my house that you have brought me this far? 19 As if this were not enough, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you also speak about the house of your servant down to a distant future time; and this is instruction for all mankind, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 20 What more can your servant David say to you when you know me so well, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah? 21 For the sake of your word and in agreement with your heart you have done all these great things and have revealed them to your servant. 22 That is why you are truly great, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah. There is no one like you, and there is no God except you; everything we have heard with our ears confirms this. 23 And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel? God went and redeemed them as his people, making a name for himself by doing great and awe-inspiring things for them. You drove out the nations and their gods in behalf of your people, whom you redeemed to yourself from Egypt. 24 You established your people Israel as your own people for all time; and you, O Jehovah, have become their God.\n25 \"Now, O Jehovah God, carry out the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house for all time, and may you do just as you have promised. 26 May your name be exalted forever, so that people may say, 'Jehovah of armies is God over Israel,' and may the house of your servant David be firmly established before you. 27 For you, Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to your servant by saying, 'I will build a house for you.' That is why your servant has the courage to pray this prayer to you. 28 And now, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you are the true God, and your words are truth, and you have promised these good things to your servant. 29 So may it please you to bless the house of your servant, and may it continue forever before you; for you, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, have promised, and with your blessing may the house of your servant be blessed forever.\"\nChapter 8\n1 Some time later, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hands of the Philistines.\n2 He defeated the Moabites and made them lie down on the ground and measured them with a line. He measured out two lines to be put to death, and one full line to be kept alive. And the Moabites became David's servants and brought tribute.\n3 David defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob the king of Zobah as he was on his way to restore his authority at the Euphrates River. 4 David captured 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers from him. Then David hamstrung all but 100 of the chariot horses.\n5 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 of the Syrians. 6 David then established garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became David's servants and brought tribute. Jehovah gave David victory wherever he went. 7 Moreover, David took the circular shields of gold from the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 8 From Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of copper.\n9 Now King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer. 10 So Toi sent his son Joram to King David to ask about his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought and defeated Hadadezer (for Hadadezer had often fought against Toi), and he brought articles of silver, gold, and copper. 11 King David sanctified these to Jehovah, along with the silver and the gold that he had sanctified from all the nations that he had subdued: 12 from Syria and Moab, from the Ammonites, the Philistines, the Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob the king of Zobah. 13 David also made a name for himself when he came back from striking down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 14 He established garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he established garrisons, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Jehovah gave David victory wherever he went.\n15 David kept reigning over all Israel, and David was administering justice and righteousness for all his people. 16 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder. 17 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Seraiah was secretary. 18 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And David's sons became chief ministers.\nChapter 9\n1 David then said: \"Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I may show loyal love for the sake of Jonathan?\" 2 Now there was a servant of the house of Saul named Ziba. So they called him to David, and the king asked him: \"Are you Ziba?\" He replied: \"I am your servant.\" 3 The king continued: \"Is there anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I may extend God's loyal love?\" Ziba replied to the king: \"There is still one son of Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet.\" 4 The king asked him: \"Where is he?\" Ziba replied to the king: \"He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel at Lo-debar.\"\n5 King David immediately sent for him and took him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel at Lo-debar. 6 When Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul came in to David, he at once fell facedown and prostrated himself. Then David said: \"Mephibosheth!\" to which he replied: \"Here is your servant.\" 7 David said to him: \"Do not be afraid, for I will certainly show loyal love to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will return to you all the land of Saul your grandfather, and you will always dine at my table.\"\n8 At that he prostrated himself and said: \"What is your servant, that you have turned your attention to a dead dog like me?\" 9 The king now sent for Ziba, Saul's attendant, and said to him: \"Everything that belonged to Saul and to all his house I give to the grandson of your master. 10 You will cultivate the land for him-you and your sons and your servants-and you will gather its produce to provide food for those who belong to the grandson of your master to eat. But Mephibosheth, the grandson of your master, will always dine at my table.\"\nNow Ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants. 11 Then Ziba said to the king: \"Your servant will do all that my lord the king commands his servant to do.\" So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like one of the sons of the king. 12 Now Mephibosheth also had a young son named Mica; and all those who lived in Ziba's house became servants of Mephibosheth. 13 And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the table of the king; and he was crippled in both feet.\nChapter 10\n1 Later the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king in his place. 2 At that David said: \"I will show loyal love toward Hanun the son of Nahash as his father showed loyal love toward me.\" So David sent his servants to offer him comfort over the loss of his father. But when David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites, 3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord: \"Do you think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you? Is it not to search through the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it that David has sent his servants to you?\" 4 So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved off half their beards and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away. 5 When David was told, he at once sent men to meet them, because the men had been deeply humiliated; and the king told them: \"Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, and then return.\"\n6 In time the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, so the Ammonites sent and hired Syrians of Beth-rehob and Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers; and the king of Maacah, with 1,000 men; and from Ishtob, 12,000 men. 7 When David heard about it, he sent Joab and the entire army, including his mightiest warriors. 8 And the Ammonites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city gate while the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, along with Ishtob and Maacah, were by themselves in the open field.\n9 When Joab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear, he chose some of the best troops in Israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the Syrians. 10 He put the rest of the men under the command of his brother Abishai, in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the Ammonites. 11 Then he said: \"If the Syrians become too strong for me, then you must come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites become too strong for you, I will come to your rescue. 12 We must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah will do what is good in his eyes.\"\n13 Then Joab and his men advanced to meet the Syrians in battle, and they fled from before him. 14 When the Ammonites saw that the Syrians had fled, they fled from Abishai and went into the city. After that Joab returned from the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.\n15 When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped. 16 So Hadadezer sent for the Syrians in the region of the River, and then they came to Helam, with Shobach the chief of the army of Hadadezer leading them.\n17 When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians then drew up in battle formation to meet David and fought against him. 18 But the Syrians fled from Israel; and David killed 700 charioteers and 40,000 horsemen of the Syrians, and he struck down Shobach the chief of their army, who died there. 19 When all the kings, the servants of Hadadezer, saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they promptly made peace with Israel and became their subjects; and the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.\nChapter 11\n1 At the start of the year, at the time when kings go on campaigns, David sent Joab and his servants and the entire army of Israel to bring the Ammonites to ruin, and they besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem.\n2 One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the rooftop of the king's house. From the rooftop he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful. 3 David sent someone to inquire about the woman, and he reported: \"Is this not Bath-sheba the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?\" 4 Then David sent messengers to bring her. So she came in to him, and he lay down with her. (This happened while she was purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Afterward, she returned to her house.\n5 The woman became pregnant, and she sent a message to David: \"I am pregnant.\" 6 At this David sent a message to Joab: \"Send to me Uriah the Hittite.\" So Joab sent Uriah to David. 7 When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was getting along, how the troops were getting along, and how the war was going. 8 David then said to Uriah: \"Go down to your house and relax.\" When Uriah left the king's house, the king's courtesy gift was sent after him. 9 However, Uriah slept at the entrance of the king's house with all the other servants of his lord, and he did not go down to his own house. 10 So David was told: \"Uriah did not go down to his own house.\" At that David said to Uriah: \"Have you not just returned from a journey? Why did you not go down to your own house?\" 11 Uriah replied to David: \"The Ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. So should I go into my own house to eat and drink and lie down with my wife? As surely as you live and are alive, I will not do this thing!\"\n12 Then David said to Uriah: \"Stay here also today, and tomorrow I will send you away.\" So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem on that day and the following day. 13 David then sent for him to come and eat and drink with him, and he got him drunk. But in the evening, he went out to sleep on his bed with the servants of his lord, and he did not go down to his house. 14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 15 He wrote in the letter: \"Put Uriah in the front lines where the fighting is fiercest. Then retreat from behind him, so that he will be struck down and die.\"\n16 Joab had been carefully watching the city, and he stationed Uriah where he knew there were mighty warriors. 17 When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of David's servants fell, and Uriah the Hittite was among those who died. 18 Joab now reported to David all the news about the war. 19 He instructed the messenger: \"When you finish speaking to the king about all the news of the war, 20 the king may become angry and say to you, 'Why did you have to go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the top of the wall? 21 Who struck down Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from the top of the wall, causing his death at Thebez? Why did you have to go so close to the wall?' Then say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.'\"\n22 So the messenger went and told David everything that Joab had sent him to tell. 23 Then the messenger told David: \"Their men overpowered us, and they came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate. 24 And the archers were shooting at your servants from the top of the wall, and some of the servants of the king died; your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.\" 25 At that David said to the messenger: \"Say this to Joab: 'Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Intensify your battle against the city and conquer it.' And encourage him.\"\n26 When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah had died, she began to mourn her husband. 27 As soon as the mourning period was over, David sent for her and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But what David had done was very displeasing to Jehovah.\nChapter 12\n1 So Jehovah sent Nathan to David. He came in to him and said: \"There were two men in one city, the one rich and the other poor. 2 The rich man had very many sheep and cattle; 3 but the poor man had nothing but one small female lamb, which he had bought. He cared for it, and it grew up together with him and his sons. It would eat from the little food he had and drink from his cup and sleep in his arms. It became as a daughter to him. 4 Later a visitor came to the rich man, but he would not take any of his own sheep and cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.\"\n5 At this David grew very angry against the man, and he said to Nathan: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, the man who did this deserves to die! 6 And he should pay for the lamb four times over, because he did this and showed no compassion.\"\n7 Then Nathan said to David: \"You are the man! This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'I myself anointed you as king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul. 8 I was willing to give you your master's house and put your master's wives in your arms, and I gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And as if that were not enough, I was willing to do much more for you. 9 Why did you despise the word of Jehovah by doing what is bad in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword! Then you took his wife as your wife after you killed him by the sword of the Ammonites. 10 Now a sword will never depart from your own house, because you despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite as your wife.' 11 This is what Jehovah says: 'Here I am bringing against you calamity from within your own house; and before your own eyes, I will take your wives and give them to another man, and he will lie down with your wives in broad daylight. 12 Although you acted in secret, I will do this in front of all Israel and in broad daylight.'\"\n13 David then said to Nathan: \"I have sinned against Jehovah.\" Nathan replied to David: \"Jehovah, in turn, forgives your sin. You will not die. 14 Nevertheless, because you have treated Jehovah with utter disrespect in this matter, the son just born to you will certainly die.\"\n15 Then Nathan went to his own house.\nAnd Jehovah struck the child whom Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became sick. 16 David pleaded with the true God in behalf of the boy. David went on a strict fast and would go in and spend the night lying on the ground. 17 So the elders of his house stood over him and tried to raise him up from the ground, but he refused and would not eat with them. 18 On the seventh day the child died, but David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. They said: \"While the child was alive we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. So how can we tell him that the child has died? He may do something terrible.\"\n19 When David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he discerned that the child had died. David said to his servants: \"Has the child died?\" They replied: \"He has died.\" 20 So David got up from the ground. He washed, rubbed himself with oil, changed his clothing, and went to the house of Jehovah and prostrated himself. Afterward, he went to his house and asked for food to be brought to him, and he ate. 21 His servants asked him: \"Why have you acted in this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and kept weeping; but as soon as the child died, you got up and ate food.\" 22 He replied: \"While the child was alive, I fasted and kept weeping because I said to myself, 'Who knows whether Jehovah may show me favor and let the child live?' 23 Now that he has died, why should I fast? Can I bring him back? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.\"\n24 Then David comforted his wife Bath-sheba. He went in to her and lay down with her. In time she bore a son, and he was named Solomon. And Jehovah loved him, 25 and he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah, for the sake of Jehovah.\n26 Joab continued fighting against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and he captured the royal city. 27 So Joab sent messengers to David and said: \"I have fought against Rabbah, and I have captured the city of waters. 28 Now gather the rest of the troops and encamp against the city and capture it. Otherwise, I will be the one to capture the city, and it will be credited to me.\"\n29 So David gathered all the troops and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it. 30 Then he took the crown of Malcam from its head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, along with precious stones, and it was placed on David's head. He also took a vast amount of spoil from the city. 31 And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones, at working with sharp iron instruments and with iron axes, and at brickmaking. That was what he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Finally David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.\nChapter 13\n1 Now David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and David's son Amnon fell in love with her. 2 Amnon was so distressed that he became sick because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for Amnon to do anything to her. 3 Now Amnon had a companion named Jehonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jehonadab was a very clever man. 4 So he said to him: \"Why are you, the king's son, so depressed every morning? Why not tell me?\" Amnon replied to him: \"I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.\" 5 Jehonadab replied to him: \"Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Please, let my sister Tamar come and serve me some food. If she prepares the food given to the sick before my eyes, I will eat it from her hand.'\"\n6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and the king came in to see him. Then Amnon said to the king: \"Please, let my sister Tamar come in and bake two heart-shaped cakes before my eyes so that I may take food from her hand.\" 7 At that David sent a message to Tamar at the house, saying: \"Please go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare food for him.\" 8 So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, where he was lying down. She took the dough and kneaded it into cakes before his eyes and cooked the cakes. 9 Then she took the pan and served him. But Amnon refused to eat and said: \"Have everybody leave me!\" So everybody left him.\n10 Amnon now said to Tamar: \"Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat it from your hand.\" So Tamar took the heart-shaped cakes that she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom. 11 When she brought them for him to eat, he grabbed her and said: \"Come, lie down with me, my sister.\" 12 But she said to him: \"No, my brother! Do not humiliate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing. 13 How could I live down my shame? And you will be regarded as one of the disgraceful men in Israel. Now speak, please, to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.\" 14 But he refused to listen to her, and he overpowered her and humiliated her by raping her. 15 Then Amnon began hating her with a very intense hatred, so that his hatred for her became greater than the love he had felt for her. Amnon said to her: \"Get up; go away!\" 16 At this she said to him: \"No, my brother, for sending me away now is worse than what you have done with me!\" But he refused to listen to her.\n17 With that he called his young attendant and said: \"Get this person out of my presence, please, and lock the door behind her.\" 18 (Now she was wearing a special robe, for those were the garments that the virgin daughters of the king wore.) So his attendant led her outside, and he locked the door behind her. 19 Then Tamar put ashes on her head, and she ripped apart the fine robe she was wearing; and she kept her hands on her head and walked off, crying out as she walked.\n20 At this her brother Absalom asked her: \"Was it your brother Amnon who was with you? And now keep silent, my sister. He is your brother. Do not let your heart dwell on this matter.\" Then Tamar lived in isolation at the house of her brother Absalom. 21 When King David heard about all these things, he became very angry. But he would not hurt the feelings of Amnon his son, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn. 22 And Absalom said nothing to Amnon, either bad or good; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar.\n23 After two full years, Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor, near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the sons of the king. 24 So Absalom came in to the king and said: \"Your servant is having his sheep sheared. Please let the king and his servants go with me.\" 25 But the king said to Absalom: \"No, my son. If all of us go, we will be a burden to you.\" Although he kept urging him, he did not consent to go, but he blessed him. 26 Absalom then said: \"If not you, please let my brother Amnon go with us.\" The king replied to him: \"Why should he go with you?\" 27 But Absalom urged him, so he sent Amnon and all the king's sons with him.\n28 Then Absalom ordered his attendants: \"Watch, and when Amnon's heart is in a cheerful mood from the wine, I will say to you, 'Strike down Amnon!' You must then put him to death. Do not be afraid. Is it not I who command you? Be strong and courageous.\" 29 So Absalom's attendants did to Amnon exactly as Absalom had ordered; then all the other sons of the king got up, and each one mounted his mule and fled. 30 While they were on the way, the report reached David: \"Absalom has struck down all the sons of the king, and not one of them survived.\" 31 At this the king got up and ripped his clothes apart and lay on the ground, and all his servants were standing by with their garments ripped apart.\n32 However, Jehonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said: \"Do not let my lord think that they have killed all the young sons of the king, for only Amnon has died. This is by the order of Absalom, who decided to do this from the day that Amnon humiliated his sister Tamar. 33 Now do not let my lord the king pay attention to the report that says, 'All the king's sons have died'; only Amnon has died.\"\n34 Meanwhile, Absalom ran away. Later the watchman raised his eyes and saw that there were many people coming from the road behind him next to the mountain. 35 At this Jehonadab said to the king: \"Look! The king's sons have returned. It is just as your servant said.\" 36 As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, weeping loudly; also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly. 37 But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud the king of Geshur. David mourned his son for many days. 38 After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there for three years.\n39 Finally King David longed to go to Absalom, for he had become reconciled to the death of Amnon.\nChapter 14\n1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah learned that the king's heart longed for Absalom. 2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and summoned from there a clever woman and told her: \"Act like you are in mourning, please, and put on garments of mourning, and do not rub yourself with oil. Behave like a woman who has been mourning over someone dead for a long time. 3 Then go in and speak to the king like this.\" With that Joab put the words in her mouth.\n4 The Tekoite woman went in to the king and fell with her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said: \"Help me, O king!\" 5 The king replied to her: \"What is the matter?\" To this she said: \"Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead. 6 And I, your servant, had two sons, and the two of them fought with each other in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other down and killed him. 7 Now the whole family has risen up against me, your servant, and they are saying, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, even if it means wiping out the heir!' They would extinguish the last glowing coal that I have left and leave to my husband neither a name nor a survivor on the surface of the earth.\"\n8 Then the king said to the woman: \"Go to your home, and I will issue an order regarding you.\" 9 At this the Tekoite woman said to the king: \"O my lord the king, let the guilt be on me and on my father's house, while the king and his throne are innocent.\" 10 The king then said: \"If anyone speaks further to you, bring him to me, and he will never trouble you again.\" 11 But she said: \"Please, let the king remember Jehovah your God, so that the avenger of blood does not bring ruin and annihilate my son.\" To this he said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, not one of your son's hairs will fall to the ground.\" 12 The woman now said: \"Let your servant, please, speak a word to my lord the king.\" So he said: \"Speak!\"\n13 The woman said: \"Why, then, have you thought to do something like this against the people of God? When the king speaks this way, he makes himself guilty, for the king does not bring back his own banished son. 14 We will surely die and be like waters that are poured out on the ground, which cannot be recovered. But God would not take away a life, and he considers reasons why the banished one should not always be banished from him. 15 I have come in to say this to my lord the king because the people made me afraid. So your servant said, 'Let me speak, please, to the king. Perhaps the king will act on the request of his slave. 16 The king may listen and rescue his slave from the hand of the man seeking to annihilate me and my only son from the inheritance God gave us.' 17 Then your servant said, 'May the word of my lord the king please give me relief,' for my lord the king is just like an angel of the true God in distinguishing what is good from what is bad. May Jehovah your God be with you.\"\n18 The king now answered the woman: \"Please do not hide from me anything I ask you.\" The woman replied: \"Let my lord the king speak, please.\" 19 The king then asked: \"Did Joab put you up to all of this?\" The woman answered: \"As surely as you are living, O my lord the king, it is just as my lord the king says, for it was your servant Joab who instructed me and put all these words in the mouth of your servant. 20 Your servant Joab has done this to change the appearance of things, but my lord has wisdom like that of the angel of the true God and knows all that is happening in the land.\"\n21 The king then said to Joab: \"All right, I will do this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.\" 22 At this Joab fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and praised the king. Joab said: \"Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, O my lord the king, because the king has acted on the request of his servant.\" 23 Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24 However, the king said: \"Let him return to his own house, but he may not see my face.\" So Absalom returned to his own house, and he did not see the face of the king.\n25 Now in all Israel, no man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no flaw in him. 26 When he shaved his head-he had to shave it at the end of every year because it was so heavy for him-the hair of his head weighed 200 shekels by the royal stone weight. 27 To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a very beautiful woman.\n28 And Absalom continued living in Jerusalem for two full years, but he did not see the face of the king. 29 So Absalom summoned Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. Then he sent for him again, a second time, and he still refused to come. 30 Finally he said to his servants: \"Joab's plot of land is next to mine, and he has some barley there. Go and set it on fire.\" So the servants of Absalom set the plot of land on fire. 31 At this Joab got up and came to Absalom's house and said to him: \"Why did your servants set my plot of land on fire?\" 32 Absalom replied to Joab: \"Look! I sent this message to you, 'Come and let me send you to the king to ask: \"Why have I come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to stay there. Now let me see the face of the king, and if there is guilt in me, then he should put me to death.\"'\"\n33 So Joab went in to the king and told him. Then he called Absalom, who came in to the king and prostrated himself before him, falling with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.\nChapter 15\n1 After all these things, Absalom acquired for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men to run before him. 2 Absalom would rise up early and stand at the side of the road to the city gate. Whenever any man had a legal case that was to come to the king for judgment, Absalom would call him and say: \"From what city are you?\" and he would say: \"Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.\" 3 Absalom would say to him: \"See, your claims are right and proper, but there is no one from the king to hear your case.\" 4 Absalom would say: \"If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then every man who has a legal case or judgment could come to me, and I would see that he receives justice.\"\n5 And when a man came near to bow down to him, Absalom would extend his hand and grab hold of him and kiss him. 6 Absalom would do this to all the Israelites who would come in to the king for judgment; so Absalom kept stealing the hearts of the men of Israel.\n7 At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king: \"Let me go, please, to Hebron to pay my vow that I made to Jehovah. 8 For your servant made this solemn vow when I was dwelling in Geshur in Syria: 'If Jehovah will bring me back to Jerusalem, I will make an offering to Jehovah.'\" 9 So the king said to him: \"Go in peace.\" With that he rose up and went to Hebron.\n10 Absalom now sent spies through all the tribes of Israel, saying: \"As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, announce, 'Absalom has become king in Hebron!'\" 11 Now 200 men from Jerusalem had gone there with Absalom; they were invited and went unsuspectingly, unaware of what was happening. 12 Further, when he offered the sacrifices, Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's adviser, from his city Giloh. The conspiracy kept gaining momentum, and the people who supported Absalom were growing in number.\n13 In time an informer came to David, saying: \"The heart of the men of Israel has turned to Absalom.\" 14 At once David said to all his servants with him in Jerusalem: \"Get up, and let us run away, for none of us will escape from Absalom! Hurry, for fear he may quickly overtake us and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the sword!\" 15 The king's servants replied to the king: \"Whatever my lord the king decides, your servants are ready to do.\" 16 So the king went out with all his household following him, but the king left ten concubines to take care of the house. 17 And the king continued on his way out with all the people following, and they stopped at Beth-merhak.\n18 All his servants leaving with him and all the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the Gittites, 600 men who had followed him from Gath, were passing by as the king reviewed them. 19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite: \"Why should you also go with us? Go back and dwell with the new king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your place. 20 Yesterday you came, so today should I make you wander with us, to go when I must go and where I must go? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may Jehovah show you loyal love and faithfulness!\" 21 But Ittai answered the king: \"As surely as Jehovah is living and as surely as my lord the king is living, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there your servant will be!\" 22 At that David said to Ittai: \"Go and cross over.\" So Ittai the Gittite crossed over, together with all his men and children.\n23 Everyone in the land was weeping loudly while all these people crossed over, and the king was standing by the Kidron Valley; all the people were crossing over to the road leading to the wilderness. 24 Zadok was also there and with him were all the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of the true God; and they set the Ark of the true God down; and Abiathar went up, while all the people completed crossing over from the city. 25 But the king said to Zadok: \"Take the Ark of the true God back to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will also bring me back and let me see it and its dwelling place. 26 But if he should say, 'I have found no pleasure in you,' then let him do to me whatever seems good in his eyes.\" 27 The king said to Zadok the priest: \"Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and take the two sons of you men with you, Ahimaaz your own son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28 See, I will linger by the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.\" 29 So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of the true God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.\n30 As David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was weeping as he went up; his head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. All the people with him also covered their heads and were weeping as they went up. 31 David was then told: \"Ahithophel is among those conspiring with Absalom.\" At this David said: \"Turn, please, the advice of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah!\"\n32 When David came to the summit where people used to bow down to God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him, with his robe ripped apart and dirt on his head. 33 However, David said to him: \"If you go across with me, you will be a load on me. 34 But if you return to the city and you say to Absalom, 'I am your servant, O King. I was the servant of your father in the past, but now I am your servant,' you can then frustrate the advice of Ahithophel for me. 35 Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? You must tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests everything that you hear from the house of the king. 36 Look! There with them are their two sons, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, and through them send to me everything that you hear.\" 37 So Hushai, David's friend, went into the city as Absalom was entering into Jerusalem.\nChapter 16\n1 When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba, the attendant of Mephibosheth, was there to meet him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them were 200 loaves of bread, 100 cakes of raisins, 100 cakes of summer fruit, and a large jar of wine. 2 Then the king said to Ziba: \"Why have you brought these things?\" Ziba replied: \"The donkeys are for the household of the king to ride, the bread and the summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those who get exhausted in the wilderness to drink.\" 3 The king now said: \"And where is the son of your master?\" At this Ziba said to the king: \"He is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give back the royal rule of my father to me.'\" 4 The king then said to Ziba: \"Look! Everything that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.\" Ziba replied: \"I bow down before you. May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.\"\n5 When King David reached Bahurim, a man of the family of Saul's house named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out shouting curses as he approached. 6 He was throwing stones at David and at all the servants of King David, as well as at all the people and the mighty men on his right and on his left. 7 Shimei said as he cursed: \"Get out, get out, you bloodguilty man! You worthless man! 8 Jehovah has brought back on you all the bloodguilt for the house of Saul, in whose place you have ruled as king, but Jehovah gives the kingship into the hand of Absalom your son. Now calamity has overtaken you because you are a bloodguilty man!\"\n9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king: \"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, please, and take off his head.\" 10 But the king said: \"What do I have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him curse me, for Jehovah has said to him, 'Curse David!' So who should say, 'Why are you doing this?'\" 11 David then said to Abishai and all his servants: \"Here my own son, who came from my own body, is seeking my life, and how much more now a Benjaminite! Leave him alone so that he may curse me, for Jehovah told him to! 12 Perhaps Jehovah will see my affliction, and Jehovah will restore goodness to me instead of the curses shouted at me this day.\" 13 With that David and his men kept going down the road while Shimei was walking alongside the mountain abreast of him, shouting curses and throwing stones and a lot of dust.\n14 At length the king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted, and they refreshed themselves.\n15 Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel arrived in Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. 16 When Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came in to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom: \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\" 17 At this Absalom said to Hushai: \"Is this your loyal love toward your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?\" 18 So Hushai said to Absalom: \"No, I am on the side of the one who has been chosen by Jehovah, this people, and all the men of Israel. I will stay with him. 19 And again I say, Whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.\"\n20 Absalom then said to Ahithophel: \"Give me your advice. What should we do?\" 21 At that Ahithophel said to Absalom: \"Have relations with your father's concubines, those whom he left behind to take care of the house. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and those who support you will be strengthened.\" 22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom had relations with the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel.\n23 In those days the advice that Ahithophel gave was considered as the word of the true God. That was how all the advice of Ahithophel was esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.\nChapter 17\n1 Ahithophel then said to Absalom: \"Please let me choose 12,000 men and rise up and chase after David tonight. 2 I will come upon him when he is weary and powerless, and I will throw him into a panic; and all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike down only the king. 3 Then I will bring all the people back to you. The return of all the people depends on what happens with the man you are seeking. Then all the people will be at peace.\" 4 The proposal was just right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.\n5 However, Absalom said: \"Please call Hushai the Archite as well, and let us hear what he has to say.\" 6 So Hushai came in to Absalom. Then Absalom said to him: \"This is the advice Ahithophel gave. Should we act on his advice? If not, you tell us.\" 7 At this Hushai said to Absalom: \"The advice that Ahithophel gave is not good in this instance!\"\n8 Hushai continued: \"You well know that your father and his men are mighty, and they are desperate, like a bear that has lost her cubs in the field. Moreover, your father is a warrior, and he will not spend the night with the people. 9 At this very moment he is hiding in one of the caves or in some other place; and if he attacks first, those hearing of it will say, 'The people following Absalom have been defeated!' 10 Even the courageous man whose heart is like that of a lion will surely melt in fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that the men with him are courageous. 11 I give this advice: Let all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, as many as the grains of sand by the sea, and you should lead them into the fight. 12 We will come against him wherever he is found, and we will come upon him just like the dew that falls on the ground; and not one of them will survive, not he nor any of the men with him. 13 If he retreats into a city, all Israel will carry ropes to that city, and we will drag it down into the valley until not even a pebble is left.\"\n14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said: \"The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than the advice of Ahithophel!\" For Jehovah had determined to frustrate the sound advice of Ahithophel, so that Jehovah could bring disaster on Absalom.\n15 Hushai later said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: \"This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised. 16 Now quickly send word to David and warn him: 'Do not stay at the fords of the wilderness tonight, but cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him may be wiped out.'\"\n17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel; so a servant girl went off and told them and they went to tell King David, for they did not dare to be seen entering the city. 18 However, a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them quickly went off and came to the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his courtyard. They went down into it, 19 and the man's wife spread a covering over the top of the well and covered it with cracked grain; no one knew about it. 20 The servants of Absalom came to the woman at her house and asked: \"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" The woman replied: \"They passed by toward the water.\" Then the men searched for them but did not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.\n21 After the men were gone, they came up out of the well and went and informed King David. They said to him: \"Rise up and quickly cross the water, for this is what Ahithophel advised against you.\" 22 Immediately David and all the people with him rose up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed the Jordan.\n23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been acted on, he saddled a donkey and went to his house in his hometown. After he gave instructions to his household, he hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the burial place of his forefathers.\n24 Meanwhile, David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. 25 Absalom put Amasa in charge of the army in place of Joab; Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Israelite, who had relations with Abigail the daughter of Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother. 26 Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.\n27 As soon as David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 28 brought beds, basins, clay pots, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, broad beans, lentils, parched grain, 29 honey, butter, sheep, and cheese. They brought all of this out for David and the people with him to eat, for they said: \"The people are hungry and tired and thirsty in the wilderness.\"\nChapter 18\n1 Then David numbered the men who were with him and placed over them chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds. 2 And David sent one third of the men under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Joab's brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. The king then said to the men: \"I will also go out with you.\" 3 But they said: \"You must not go out, for if we flee, they would not care about us; and if half of us would die, they would not care about us, because you are worth 10,000 of us. Therefore, it would be better if you would send us help from the city.\" 4 The king said to them: \"Whatever seems best to you, I will do.\" So the king stood next to the city gate, and all the men went out by hundreds and by thousands. 5 Then the king gave Joab and Abishai and Ittai this order: \"Deal gently with the young man Absalom for my sake.\" All the men heard it when the king gave all the chiefs the order about Absalom.\n6 The men went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. 7 There the people of Israel were defeated by the servants of David, and a great slaughter took place on that day-20,000 men. 8 The battle spread through the whole region. Furthermore, the forest devoured more of the people than the sword did on that day.\n9 Absalom eventually found himself facing the servants of David. Absalom was riding on a mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a large tree, and his head got entangled in the big tree, so that he was suspended in midair while the mule he had been riding kept going. 10 Then someone saw it and told Joab: \"Look! I have seen Absalom hanging in a big tree.\" 11 Joab replied to the man who told him: \"If you saw it, why did you not strike him down to the ground on the spot? Then I would have gladly given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.\" 12 But the man said to Joab: \"Even if I were handed 1,000 pieces of silver, I could not lift my hand against the king's son, for we heard the king order you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Whoever you are, watch over the young man Absalom.' 13 If I had disobeyed and taken his life, it could never have remained hidden from the king, and you would not have protected me.\" 14 To this Joab said: \"I am not going to waste any more time with you!\" So he took three spikes in his hand and drove them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the midst of the big tree. 15 Then ten attendants who carried Joab's weapons came and struck Absalom until he was dead. 16 Joab now blew the horn, and the men returned from chasing after Israel; Joab called for them to halt. 17 They took Absalom and threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up over him a very big heap of stones. And all Israel fled to their homes.\n18 Now Absalom, while he was alive, had taken and set up for himself a pillar in the Valley of the King, for he said: \"I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.\" So he named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day.\n19 Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said: \"Let me run, please, and break the news to the king, for Jehovah has given him justice by freeing him from his enemies.\" 20 But Joab said to him: \"You will not be a bearer of news this day. You may break the news on another day, but today you will not break the news, because the king's own son has died.\" 21 Then Joab said to a Cushite: \"Go, tell the king what you have seen.\" At that the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran off. 22 Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once again to Joab: \"Whatever happens, please let me also run behind the Cushite.\" However, Joab said: \"Why should you run, my son, when there is no news for you to tell?\" 23 Still he said: \"Whatever happens, let me run.\" So Joab said to him: \"Run!\" And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the district of the Jordan, and he eventually overtook the Cushite.\n24 Now David was sitting between the two city gates, and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall. He looked up and saw a man running by himself. 25 So the watchman called out and told the king. The king said: \"If he is by himself, he has news to tell.\" As he came steadily nearer, 26 the watchman saw another man running. The watchman then called to the gatekeeper: \"Look! Another man running by himself!\" The king said: \"This one is also bringing news.\" 27 The watchman said: \"I can see that the first man runs like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok,\" so the king said: \"He is a good man, and he comes with good news.\" 28 Ahimaaz then called out to the king: \"All is well!\" With that he bowed to the king with his face to the ground. Then he said: \"May Jehovah your God be praised, who has surrendered the men who rebelled against my lord the king!\"\n29 However, the king said: \"Is everything all right with the young man Absalom?\" To this Ahimaaz said: \"I saw the great commotion when Joab sent the king's servant and your servant, but I did not know what it was.\" 30 So the king said: \"Step aside, stand here.\" At that he stepped aside and stood there.\n31 Then the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said: \"Let my lord the king accept this news: Today Jehovah has brought justice by freeing you from the hand of all those who rebelled against you.\" 32 But the king said to the Cushite: \"Is everything all right with the young man Absalom?\" To this the Cushite said: \"May all the enemies of my lord the king and all those who rebelled against you to harm you become like the young man!\"\n33 This disturbed the king, and he went up to the roof chamber over the gateway and wept, saying as he walked: \"My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom my son, my son!\"\nChapter 19\n1 It was reported to Joab: \"The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.\" 2 So the victory on that day was turned into mourning for all the people, because they heard that the king was grieving over his son. 3 The people quietly returned to the city that day like people who are ashamed because they fled in the battle. 4 The king covered his face and kept crying out with a loud voice: \"My son Absalom! Absalom my son, my son!\"\n5 Then Joab went in to the king at the house and said: \"Today you have put to shame all your servants who this day saved your life and the lives of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines. 6 You love those who hate you and hate those who love you, for you have made it clear today that your chiefs and servants mean nothing to you, because I am sure that if only Absalom were alive today and the rest of us were dead, it would be all right with you. 7 Now get up, go out and reassure your servants, because by Jehovah I swear that if you do not go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse for you than all the injury that has come upon you from your youth until now.\" 8 So the king rose up and sat in the city gate, and all the people were informed: \"Now the king is sitting in the gate.\" Then all the people came before the king.\nBut Israel had fled, each to his home. 9 All the people in all the tribes of Israel were disputing, saying: \"The king saved us from our enemies, and he rescued us from the Philistines; but now he has fled the land because of Absalom. 10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in the battle. So now, why are you doing nothing to bring the king back?\"\n11 King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: \"Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, 'Why should you be the last ones to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king at his house? 12 You are my brothers; you are my own bone and flesh. Why should you be the last ones to bring the king back?' 13 And you should say to Amasa, 'Are you not my own bone and flesh? So may God do to me and add to it if you will not become my army chief from now on instead of Joab.'\"\n14 So he won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent word to the king: \"Come back, you and all your servants.\"\n15 The king started back and reached the Jordan, and the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to escort him across the Jordan. 16 Then Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David, 17 and there were 1,000 men from Benjamin with him. Also Ziba, the attendant of the house of Saul, with his 15 sons and 20 servants, rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king. 18 He crossed the ford to bring the king's household across and to do whatever he desired. But Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he was about to cross the Jordan. 19 He said to the king: \"Do not let my lord hold me guilty, and do not remember the wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem. May the king not take it to heart, 20 for your servant well knows that I have sinned; so today I have been the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.\"\n21 At once Abishai the son of Zeruiah said: \"Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the anointed of Jehovah?\" 22 But David said: \"What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should act against me today? Should anyone be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?\" 23 Then the king said to Shimei: \"You will not die.\" And the king gave him his oath.\n24 Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul, also came down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his garments from the day the king left until the day he returned in peace. 25 When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him: \"Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?\" 26 To this he said: \"My lord the king, my servant tricked me. For your servant had said, 'Let me get my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go with the king,' for your servant is crippled. 27 But he slandered your servant to my lord the king. However, my lord the king is like an angel of the true God, so do whatever seems good to you. 28 All the household of my father could have been doomed to death by my lord the king, and yet you placed your servant among those eating at your table. So what right do I have to cry out further to the king?\"\n29 However, the king said to him: \"Why keep on speaking like this? I have decided that you and Ziba should share the field.\" 30 At this Mephibosheth said to the king: \"Let him take it all, now that my lord the king has come to his house in peace.\"\n31 Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim to the Jordan to escort the king to the Jordan. 32 Barzillai was very old, 80 years of age, and he supplied the king with food while he was staying in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 33 So the king said to Barzillai: \"Cross over with me, and I will supply you with food in Jerusalem.\" 34 But Barzillai said to the king: \"How many days of my life are left that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 35 I am 80 years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can I, your servant, taste what I eat and drink? Can I still listen to the voice of male and female singers? So why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 36 It is enough that your servant could bring the king to the Jordan. Why should the king repay me with this reward? 37 Let your servant return, please, and let me die in my city near the burial place of my father and my mother. But here is your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and you may do for him what seems good to you.\"\n38 So the king said: \"Chimham will go across with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you; whatever you ask of me I will do for you.\" 39 All the people now began to cross the Jordan, and when the king crossed, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him; and Barzillai returned home. 40 When the king went across to Gilgal, Chimham crossed with him. All the people of Judah and half the people of Israel brought the king across.\n41 Then all the men of Israel approached the king and said to him: \"Why did our brothers the men of Judah steal you away and bring the king and his household over the Jordan, along with all of David's men?\" 42 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel: \"Because the king is related to us. Why are you angry over this? Have we eaten anything at the king's expense, or has a gift been given to us?\"\n43 However, the men of Israel answered the men of Judah: \"We have ten parts in the king, so that we have a greater claim in David than you have. Why, then, have you treated us with contempt? Should we not have been first to bring our king back?\" But the word of the men of Judah prevailed over that of the men of Israel.\nChapter 20\n1 Now there was a troublemaker named Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. He blew the horn and said: \"We have no share in David, and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Everyone to his gods, O Israel!\" 2 At that all the men of Israel quit following David to follow Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah stuck to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.\n3 When David came to his house at Jerusalem, the king took the ten concubines he had left behind to take care of the house, and he put them in a house under guard. He supplied food to them, but he did not have any relations with them. They remained in confinement until the day of their death, living as if they were widows, even though they had a living husband.\n4 The king now said to Amasa: \"Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and you also should be here.\" 5 So Amasa went to call Judah together, but he came later than the set time that had been appointed for him. 6 Then David said to Abishai: \"Sheba the son of Bichri may do us more harm than Absalom did. Take the servants of your lord and chase after him, so that he may not find fortified cities and escape from us.\" 7 So the men of Joab, the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men went out after him; they left Jerusalem to chase after Sheba the son of Bichri. 8 When they were near the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing his battle clothing, and he had a sword in its sheath strapped to his hip. When he stepped forward, the sword fell out.\n9 Joab said to Amasa: \"Are you all right, my brother?\" Then with his right hand, Joab took hold of Amasa's beard as if to kiss him. 10 Amasa was not on guard against the sword that was in Joab's hand, and Joab stabbed him with it in the abdomen, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. He did not have to stab him again; once was enough to kill him. Then Joab and his brother Abishai chased after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n11 One of Joab's young men stood by him and was saying: \"Whoever is on Joab's side and whoever belongs to David, let him follow Joab!\" 12 All the while Amasa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road. When the man saw that all the people were stopping, he moved Amasa from the road to the field. Then he threw a garment over him, because he saw that everyone was stopping when they came up to him. 13 After he had removed him from the road, all the men followed Joab to chase after Sheba the son of Bichri.\n14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah. The Bichrites gathered together and also went in after him.\n15 Joab and his men came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah and raised up a siege rampart against the city, as it was standing within a rampart. And all the men with Joab were undermining the wall to knock it down. 16 And a wise woman called out from the city: \"Listen, men, listen! Please tell Joab, 'Come here, and let me speak to you.'\" 17 So he went near to her, and the woman said: \"Are you Joab?\" He replied: \"I am.\" At this she said to him: \"Listen to the words of your servant.\" He said: \"I am listening.\" 18 She continued: \"They would always say in the past, 'Let them inquire in Abel,' and that was the end of the matter. 19 I represent the peaceable and faithful ones of Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city that is like a mother in Israel. Why should you do away with the inheritance of Jehovah?\" 20 Joab answered: \"It is unthinkable for me to do away with it and destroy it. 21 That is not the case at all. Rather, a man named Sheba the son of Bichri from the mountainous region of Ephraim has rebelled against King David. If you hand over this one man, I will withdraw from the city.\" Then the woman said to Joab: \"Look! His head will be thrown over the wall to you!\"\n22 At once the wise woman went in to all the people, and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. At that he blew the horn, and they dispersed from the city, each one to his home; and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.\n23 Now Joab was in charge of all the army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites. 24 Adoram was over those conscripted for forced labor; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder. 25 Sheva was the secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests. 26 And Ira the Jairite also became a chief minister for David.\nChapter 21\n1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three consecutive years, so David consulted Jehovah, and Jehovah said: \"There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.\" 2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Incidentally, the Gibeonites were not Israelites but Amorites who remained, and the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.) 3 David said to the Gibeonites: \"What should I do for you, and how can I make atonement, so that you will bless the inheritance of Jehovah?\" 4 The Gibeonites said to him: \"It is not a matter of silver or gold for us in connection with Saul and his household; nor can we put any man to death in Israel.\" At that he said: \"Whatever you say, I will do for you.\" 5 They said to the king: \"The man who exterminated us and schemed to annihilate us from living anywhere in the territory of Israel- 6 let seven of his sons be given to us. We will hang their dead bodies before Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen one of Jehovah.\" The king then said: \"I will hand them over.\"\n7 However, the king showed compassion for Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath made before Jehovah between David and Jonathan, the son of Saul. 8 So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah whom she bore to Saul, and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 9 Then he handed them over to the Gibeonites, and they hung their dead bodies on the mountain before Jehovah. All seven of them died together; they were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the start of the barley harvest. 10 Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out on the rock from the start of harvest until rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies; she did not allow the birds of the heavens to land on them by day nor the wild beasts of the field to come near by night.\n11 David was told what Saul's concubine Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had done. 12 So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the leaders of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hung them on the day that the Philistines struck down Saul on Gilboa. 13 He brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan up from there, and they also gathered the bones of the men who had been executed. 14 Then they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin in Zela in the tomb of Kish his father. After they did everything that the king had commanded, God listened to their entreaties for the land.\n15 Once again there was war between the Philistines and Israel. So David and his servants went down and fought the Philistines, but David became exhausted. 16 A descendant of the Rephaim named Ishbi-benob, whose copper spear weighed 300 shekels and who was armed with a new sword, intended to strike David down. 17 At once Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and struck the Philistine down and put him to death. At that time the men of David swore this oath to him: \"You must not go out with us to battle anymore! You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!\"\n18 After this, war broke out again with the Philistines at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was a descendant of the Rephaim.\n19 And war broke out again with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite struck down Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers.\n20 War broke out yet again at Gath, where there was a man of extraordinary size, with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot, 24 in all; and he too was a descendant of the Rephaim. 21 He kept taunting Israel. So Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.\n22 These four were descendants of the Rephaim in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.\nChapter 22\n1 And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of Saul's hand. 2 He said:\n\"Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the One who rescues me.\n3 My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,\nMy shield and my horn of salvation, my secure refuge\nAnd my place to flee, my savior; you who save me from violence.\n4 I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,\nAnd I will be saved from my enemies.\n5 The waves of death broke all around me;\nFlash floods of worthless men terrified me.\n6 The ropes of the Grave surrounded me;\nThe snares of death confronted me.\n7 In my distress I called on Jehovah,\nTo my God I kept calling.\nThen from his temple he heard my voice,\nAnd my cry for help reached his ears.\n8 Back and forth the earth began to shake and rock;\nThe foundations of the heavens trembled\nAnd shook back and forth because he had been angered.\n9 Smoke ascended from his nostrils,\nAnd a consuming fire came from his mouth;\nGlowing coals blazed from him.\n10 He made the heavens bend as he descended,\nAnd thick gloom was beneath his feet.\n11 He rode on a cherub and came flying.\nHe was visible on the wings of a spirit.\n12 Then he put darkness around him as a shelter,\nIn dark waters and thick clouds.\n13 From the brightness before him fiery coals blazed.\n14 Then Jehovah began to thunder from heaven;\nThe Most High made his voice heard.\n15 He shot his arrows and scattered them;\nLightning, and he threw them into confusion.\n16 The bed of the sea became visible;\nThe foundations of the land were exposed by the rebuke of Jehovah,\nBy the blast of the breath from his nostrils.\n17 He reached down from on high;\nHe took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.\n18 He rescued me from my strong enemy,\nFrom those hating me, who were stronger than I was.\n19 They confronted me on the day of my disaster,\nBut Jehovah was my support.\n20 He brought me out into a place of safety;\nHe rescued me because he was pleased with me.\n21 Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;\nHe repays me according to the innocence of my hands.\n22 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,\nAnd I have not wickedly abandoned my God.\n23 All his judgments are before me;\nI will not deviate from his statutes.\n24 I will remain blameless before him,\nAnd I will keep myself from error.\n25 May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,\nAccording to my innocence before him.\n26 With someone loyal you act in loyalty;\nWith the blameless, mighty man, you deal blamelessly;\n27 With the pure you show yourself pure,\nBut with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.\n28 For you save those who are humble,\nBut your eyes are against the haughty, and you abase them.\n29 For you are my lamp, O Jehovah;\nIt is Jehovah who lights up my darkness.\n30 With your help I can charge against a marauder band;\nBy God's power I can scale a wall.\n31 The way of the true God is perfect;\nThe saying of Jehovah is refined.\nHe is a shield to all those taking refuge in him.\n32 For who is a God besides Jehovah?\nAnd who is a rock except our God?\n33 The true God is my strong fortress,\nAnd he will make my way perfect.\n34 He makes my feet like those of a deer;\nHe makes me stand on high places.\n35 He trains my hands for warfare;\nMy arms can bend a bow of copper.\n36 You give me your shield of salvation,\nAnd your humility makes me great.\n37 You widen the path for my footsteps;\nMy feet will not slip.\n38 I will pursue my enemies and annihilate them;\nI will not return until they are wiped out.\n39 And I will wipe them out and crush them, so that they will not rise up;\nThey will fall under my feet.\n40 You will equip me with strength for the battle;\nYou will make my foes collapse under me.\n41 You will make my enemies retreat from me;\nI will put an end to those who hate me.\n42 They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;\nThey even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them.\n43 I will pound them as fine as the dust of the earth;\nI will pulverize and trample them like mud in the streets.\n44 You will rescue me from the faultfinding of my people.\nYou will safeguard me to be the head of nations;\nA people whom I have not known will serve me.\n45 Foreigners will come cringing before me;\nWhat they hear about me will make them obey me.\n46 Foreigners will lose courage;\nThey will come trembling from their strongholds.\n47 Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!\nLet the God of the rock of my salvation be exalted.\n48 The true God executes vengeance for me;\nHe subdues the peoples under me;\n49 He rescues me from my enemies.\nYou lift me high above those who attack me;\nYou save me from the man of violence.\n50 That is why I will thank you, O Jehovah, among the nations,\nAnd to your name I will sing praises:\n51 He performs great acts of salvation for his king;\nHe displays loyal love to his anointed one,\nTo David and his offspring forever.\"\nChapter 23\n1 These are the last words of David:\n\"The word of David the son of Jesse,\nAnd the word of the man who was raised on high,\nThe anointed of the God of Jacob,\nThe pleasant singer of the songs of Israel.\n2 The spirit of Jehovah spoke through me;\nHis word was on my tongue.\n3 The God of Israel spoke;\nTo me the Rock of Israel said:\n'When the one ruling over mankind is righteous,\nRuling in the fear of God,\n4 It is like the morning light when the sun shines,\nA morning without clouds.\nIt is like the brightness after the rain,\nMaking grass sprout from the earth.'\n5 Is not my house like that before God?\nFor he has made an eternal covenant with me,\nArranged in every detail and secured.\nBecause it means my complete salvation and all my delight,\nIs that not why he makes it flourish?\n6 But worthless men are all thrown away like thornbushes,\nFor they cannot be taken with the hand.\n7 When a man touches them,\nHe should be fully armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,\nAnd they should be completely burned up with fire in their place.\"\n8 These are the names of David's mighty warriors: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, the head of the three. He brandished his spear over 800 slain at one time. 9 Next to him, Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of Ahohi was among the three mighty warriors with David when they taunted the Philistines. They had gathered there for the battle, and when the men of Israel retreated, 10 he stood his ground and kept striking down the Philistines until his arm grew weary and his hand became stiff from gripping the sword. So Jehovah brought about a great victory on that day; and the people returned behind him to strip the slain.\n11 Next to him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of land full of lentils; and the people fled because of the Philistines. 12 But he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the Philistines, so that Jehovah brought about a great victory.\n13 Three of the 30 headmen went down during the harvest to David at the cave of Adullam, and a company of the Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. 14 David was then in the stronghold, and an outpost of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. 15 Then David expressed his longing: \"If only I could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem!\" 16 At that the three mighty warriors forced their way into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem and brought it to David; but he refused to drink it and poured it out to Jehovah. 17 He said: \"It is unthinkable on my part, O Jehovah, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of the men going at the risk of their lives?\" So he refused to drink it. These are the things that his three mighty warriors did.\n18 Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was the head of another three; he brandished his spear over 300 slain, and he had a reputation like the three. 19 Although he was the most distinguished of the other three and he was their chief, he did not attain to the rank of the first three.\n20 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a courageous man who performed many exploits in Kabzeel. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab, and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 21 He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size. Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. 22 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors. 23 Although he was distinguished even more than the thirty, he did not attain to the rank of the three. However, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.\n24 Asahel the brother of Joab was among the thirty: Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 27 Abi-ezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 29 Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites, 30 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the wadis of Gaash, 31 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Bar-humite, 32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 35 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 39 and Uriah the Hittite-37 in all.\nChapter 24\n1 The anger of Jehovah again blazed against Israel when one incited David against them, saying: \"Go, take a count of Israel and Judah.\" 2 So the king said to Joab the chief of the army who was with him: \"Please go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and register the people, so that I may know the number of the people.\" 3 But Joab said to the king: \"May Jehovah your God multiply the people 100 times, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it, but why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?\"\n4 But the king's word prevailed over Joab and the chiefs of the army. So Joab and the chiefs of the army went out from before the king to register the people of Israel. 5 They crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, to the right of the city in the middle of the valley, and they went toward the Gadites and on to Jazer. 6 After that they went on to Gilead and the land of Tahtim-hodshi and continued to Dan-jaan and went around to Sidon. 7 Then they went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and finally they ended up in the Negeb of Judah at Beer-sheba. 8 Thus they went through all the land and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days. 9 Joab now gave to the king the number of the people who were registered. Israel amounted to 800,000 warriors armed with swords, and the men of Judah were 500,000.\n10 But David's heart was struck with remorse after he had numbered the people. David then said to Jehovah: \"I have sinned greatly by doing this. And now, Jehovah, please forgive your servant's error, for I have acted very foolishly.\" 11 When David got up in the morning, Jehovah's word came to Gad the prophet, David's visionary, saying: 12 \"Go and say to David, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"I am giving you three options. Choose the one that I should bring on you.\"'\" 13 So Gad came in to David and told him: \"Should seven years of famine come on your land? Or should you flee for three months from your adversaries while they pursue you? Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider carefully what I should reply to the One who sent me.\" 14 So David said to Gad: \"It is very distressing to me. Let us fall, please, into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.\"\n15 Then Jehovah sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the designated time, so that 70,000 of the people from Dan to Beer-sheba died. 16 When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah felt regret over the calamity, and he said to the angel bringing destruction among the people: \"It is enough! Now let your hand drop.\" Jehovah's angel was close to the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\n17 When David saw the angel who was striking the people down, he said to Jehovah: \"I am the one who sinned, and I am the one who did wrong; but these sheep-what have they done? Let your hand, please, come against me and my father's house.\"\n18 So Gad came in to David on that day and said to him: \"Go up, set up for Jehovah an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\" 19 So David went up at the word of Gad, as Jehovah had commanded. 20 When Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, Araunah immediately went out and bowed down to the king with his face to the ground. 21 Araunah asked: \"Why has my lord the king come to his servant?\" David replied: \"To buy from you the threshing floor in order to build an altar to Jehovah, so that the scourge against the people may be halted.\" 22 But Araunah said to David: \"Let my lord the king take it and offer up what seems good to him. Here are cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the equipment of the cattle for the wood. 23 All of this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.\" Then Araunah said to the king: \"May Jehovah your God show you favor.\"\n24 However, the king said to Araunah: \"No, I must buy it from you for a price. I will not offer up to Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.\" So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for 50 silver shekels. 25 And David built an altar there to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices. Jehovah then responded to the entreaty for the land, and the scourge against Israel was halted. \n",

    "text": "First Kings\nChapter 1\n1 Now King David was old, advanced in years, and although they would cover him with garments, he could not get warm. 2 So his servants said to him: \"Let a girl, a virgin, be found for my lord the king, and she will wait on the king as his nurse. She will lie in your arms so that my lord the king may feel warm.\" 3 They searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her in to the king. 4 The girl was extremely beautiful, and she became the king's nurse and waited on him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.\n5 Meanwhile, Adonijah the son of Haggith was exalting himself, saying: \"I am going to be king!\" He had a chariot made for himself with horsemen and 50 men to run before him. 6 But his father had never confronted him by saying: \"Why have you done this?\" He was also very handsome, and his mother had given birth to him after Absalom. 7 He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest, and they offered Adonijah help and support. 8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mighty warriors did not support Adonijah.\n9 Eventually Adonijah held a sacrifice of sheep, cattle, and fattened animals by the stone of Zoheleth, which is near En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants. 10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah and the mighty warriors, or Solomon his brother. 11 Nathan then said to Bath-sheba, Solomon's mother: \"Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and our lord David does not know anything about it? 12 So now come, please, and let me advise you, so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 13 Go in to King David and say to him, 'Was it not you, my lord the king, who swore to your servant, saying: \"Your son Solomon will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne\"? So why has Adonijah become king?' 14 While you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.\"\n15 So Bath-sheba went in to the king, into his private room. The king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was waiting on the king. 16 Then Bath-sheba bowed low and prostrated herself to the king, and the king said: \"What is your request?\" 17 She replied: \"My lord, it was you who swore by Jehovah your God to your servant, 'Your son Solomon will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne.' 18 But look! Adonijah has become king, and my lord the king does not know anything about it. 19 He sacrificed bulls, fattened animals, and sheep in great quantity and invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the chief of the army; but he did not invite your servant Solomon. 20 And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 21 Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his forefathers, I and also my son Solomon will be considered traitors.\"\n22 And while she was still speaking to the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 23 At once the king was told: \"Here is Nathan the prophet!\" He came in before the king and prostrated himself to the king with his face to the ground. 24 Then Nathan said: \"My lord the king, did you say, 'Adonijah will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne'? 25 For today he has gone down to sacrifice bulls, fattened animals, and sheep in great quantity, and he has invited all the sons of the king and the chiefs of the army and Abiathar the priest. They are there eating and drinking with him, and they keep saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' 26 But he did not invite me, your servant, or Zadok the priest, or Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, or your servant Solomon. 27 Has my lord the king authorized this without telling your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?\"\n28 King David now answered: \"Call Bath-sheba for me.\" At that she came in and stood before the king. 29 The king then swore an oath: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, the one who rescued me out of all distress, 30 just as I swore to you by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, 'Your son Solomon will become king after me, and he is the one who will sit on my throne in my place!' that is what I will bring about this day.\" 31 Then Bath-sheba bowed low with her face to the ground and prostrated herself to the king and said: \"May my lord King David live forever!\"\n32 Immediately King David said: \"Call for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.\" So they came in before the king. 33 The king said to them: \"Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and lead him down to Gihon. 34 Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint him there as king over Israel; then blow the horn and say, 'Long live King Solomon!' 35 Then follow him back, and he will come in and sit on my throne; and he will be king in my place, and I will commission him as leader over Israel and over Judah.\" 36 At once Benaiah the son of Jehoiada said to the king: \"Amen! May Jehovah the God of my lord the king confirm it. 37 Just as Jehovah was with my lord the king, so let him be with Solomon, and may He make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.\"\n38 Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on the mule of King David, and they brought him to Gihon. 39 Zadok the priest now took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed Solomon, and they began to blow the horn, and all the people began shouting: \"Long live King Solomon!\" 40 After that all the people followed him and went up, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the earth was split open by their noise.\n41 Adonijah and all those invited by him heard it when they had finished eating. As soon as Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said: \"Why is there such a noisy uproar in the city?\" 42 While he was still speaking, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said: \"Come in, for you are a good man, and you must bring good news.\" 43 But Jonathan answered Adonijah: \"No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 44 The king sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they had him ride on the mule of the king. 45 Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king in Gihon. After that they came up from there rejoicing, and the city is in an uproar. That was the noise that you heard. 46 Moreover, Solomon has sat down on the royal throne. 47 Another thing, the servants of the king have come in to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more splendid than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne!' At that the king bowed down on the bed. 48 And the king also said, 'May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, who today has granted someone to sit on my throne and has allowed my own eyes to see it!'\"\n49 And all those invited by Adonijah became terrified, and each of them rose up and went his own way. 50 Adonijah was also afraid because of Solomon, so he got up and went and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar. 51 The report was made to Solomon: \"Here Adonijah has become afraid of King Solomon; and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon first swear to me that he will not put his servant to death by the sword.'\" 52 To this Solomon said: \"If he behaves in a worthy manner, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground; but if what is bad is found in him, he will have to die.\" 53 So King Solomon sent for him to be brought down from the altar. Then he came in and bowed down to King Solomon, after which Solomon said to him: \"Go to your own house.\"\nChapter 2\n1 When the time of David's death drew near, he gave his son Solomon these instructions: 2 \"I am about to die. Therefore, be strong and prove yourself a man. 3 You must keep your obligation to Jehovah your God by walking in his ways and by observing his statutes, his commandments, his judgments, and his reminders as they are written in the Law of Moses; then you will succeed in everything you do and everywhere you turn. 4 And Jehovah will carry out his promise that he made concerning me: 'If your sons pay attention to their way by walking faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, there will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel.'\n5 \"You also well know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to two chiefs of the armies of Israel-Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether. He killed them, shedding the blood of war in peacetime, and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet. 6 You must act according to your wisdom and not let his gray hairs go down in peace to the Grave.\n7 \"But toward the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you should show loyal love, and they should be among those eating at your table, for that was how they stood by me when I ran away from your brother Absalom.\n8 \"There is also with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim. He was the one who cursed me with a vicious curse on the day that I was going to Mahanaim; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by Jehovah: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.' 9 Now do not leave him unpunished, for you are a wise man and you know what you should do to him; you must bring his gray hairs down to the Grave with blood.\"\n10 Then David was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David. 11 The length of David's reign over Israel was 40 years. In Hebron he reigned for 7 years, and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years.\n12 Solomon then sat down on the throne of David his father, and gradually his kingship became firmly established.\n13 In time Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba, Solomon's mother. She asked: \"Is your coming peaceable?\" He replied: \"It is peaceable.\" 14 He then said: \"I have something to say to you.\" So she said: \"Speak.\" 15 He continued: \"You well know that the kingship was to become mine, and all Israel expected me to become king; but the kingship eluded me and became my brother's, for it was from Jehovah that it became his. 16 But now there is just one request that I am making of you. Do not turn me away.\" So she said to him: \"Speak.\" 17 He then said: \"Please, ask Solomon the king-for he will not turn you away-to give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.\" 18 To this Bath-sheba said: \"Very well! I will speak for you to the king.\"\n19 So Bath-sheba went in to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. At once the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king's mother, so that she could sit at his right. 20 She then said: \"There is one small request that I am making of you. Do not turn me away.\" So the king said to her: \"Make it, my mother; for I will not turn you away.\" 21 She said: \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given as a wife to your brother Adonijah.\" 22 At this King Solomon answered his mother: \"Why are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You may as well request the kingship for him, for he is my older brother, and supporting him are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah.\"\n23 With that King Solomon swore by Jehovah: \"So may God do to me and add to it if it was not at the cost of his own life that Adonijah made this request. 24 And now, as surely as Jehovah is living, who has firmly established me and seated me on the throne of David my father and who made a house for me, just as he promised, Adonijah will be put to death today.\" 25 King Solomon immediately sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, who went out and struck Adonijah down, and he died.\n26 To Abiathar the priest, the king said: \"Go to your fields in Anathoth! You deserve to die, but on this day I will not put you to death because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah before David my father and because you shared in all the hardships that my father suffered.\" 27 So Solomon drove Abiathar out from serving as a priest of Jehovah, to fulfill Jehovah's word against the house of Eli in Shiloh.\n28 When the news reached Joab-for Joab had supported Adonijah but he had not supported Absalom-Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar. 29 Then King Solomon was told: \"Joab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and he is there beside the altar.\" So Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: \"Go, strike him down!\" 30 So Benaiah went to the tent of Jehovah and said to him: \"This is what the king says, 'Come out!'\" But he said: \"No! I will die here.\" Benaiah brought word back to the king: \"This is what Joab said, and this is what he answered me.\" 31 Then the king said to him: \"Do just as he said; strike him down and bury him and remove from me and from the house of my father the blood that Joab spilled without just cause. 32 Jehovah will bring his blood back on his own head, for without my father David's knowledge, he struck down and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than he was: Abner the son of Ner, the chief of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the chief of the army of Judah. 33 Their blood will come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his offspring forever; but for David, his offspring, his house, and his throne, may there be peace from Jehovah forever.\" 34 Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck Joab down and put him to death, and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness. 35 Then the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.\n36 Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him: \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live there; do not go out from there to any other place. 37 On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure that you will die. Your blood will be on your own head.\" 38 Shimei replied to the king: \"What you have said is fair. Your servant will do just as my lord the king has said.\" So Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for many days.\n39 But at the end of three years, two of Shimei's slaves ran away to Achish the son of Maacah the king of Gath. When Shimei was told: \"Look! Your slaves are in Gath,\" 40 Shimei immediately saddled his donkey and went to see Achish in Gath to find his slaves. When Shimei returned from Gath with his slaves, 41 Solomon was told: \"Shimei has gone out of Jerusalem to Gath and has returned.\" 42 At that the king summoned Shimei and said to him: \"Did I not put you under oath by Jehovah and warn you: 'On the day you go out from here to any other place, you can be sure that you will die'? And did you not say to me, 'What you are saying is fair; I will obey'? 43 Why, then, did you not keep the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I imposed on you?\" 44 The king then said to Shimei: \"You know in your heart all the injury that you did to David my father, and Jehovah will bring back that injury on your own head. 45 But King Solomon will be blessed, and the throne of David will be firmly established before Jehovah forever.\" 46 With that the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, who went out and struck him down, and he died.\nThus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon.\nChapter 3\n1 Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He married Pharaoh's daughter and brought her to the City of David until he finished building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall around Jerusalem. 2 But the people were still sacrificing on the high places, because until that time a house for the name of Jehovah had not yet been built. 3 Solomon continued to love Jehovah by walking in the statutes of David his father, except that he was sacrificing and making offerings smoke on the high places.\n4 The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the most prominent high place. Solomon offered 1,000 burnt sacrifices on that altar. 5 In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said: \"Ask what you would like me to give you.\" 6 At this Solomon said: \"You have shown great loyal love toward your servant David my father as he walked before you in faithfulness and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart. You have continued to show him this great loyal love down to this day by giving him a son to sit on his throne. 7 And now, Jehovah my God, you have made your servant king in the place of David my father, though I am just a youth and I am inexperienced. 8 Your servant is among your people whom you have chosen, a people so vast that they cannot be numbered or counted. 9 So grant your servant an obedient heart to judge your people, to discern between good and bad, for who is able to judge this numerous people of yours?\"\n10 It was pleasing to Jehovah that Solomon had requested this. 11 God then said to him: \"Because you requested this and you did not request for yourself long life or riches or the death of your enemies, but you requested understanding to hear judicial cases, 12 I will do what you asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that just as there has never been anyone like you before, there will never be anyone like you again. 13 Furthermore, what you have not requested I will give you, both riches and glory, so that there will be no other king like you in your lifetime. 14 And if you walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments, just as David your father walked, I will also give you a long life.\"\n15 When Solomon awoke, he realized that it had been a dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion offerings and spread a feast for all his servants.\n16 At that time two prostitutes came in to the king and stood before him. 17 The first woman said: \"Please, my lord, this woman and I live in one house, and I gave birth while she was in the house. 18 On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together, just the two of us; there was no one else with us in the house. 19 During the night this woman's son died, because she lay on him. 20 So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your slave girl was asleep and laid him in her arms, and she laid her dead son in my arms. 21 When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, I saw that he was dead. So I examined him closely in the morning and saw that it was not my son whom I had given birth to.\" 22 But the other woman said: \"No, my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one!\" But the first woman was saying: \"No, your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.\" That is how they argued before the king.\n23 Finally the king said: \"This one says, 'This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one!' and that one says, 'No, your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one!'\" 24 The king said: \"Bring me a sword.\" So they brought a sword to the king. 25 The king then said: \"Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other.\" 26 At once the woman whose son was the living one pleaded with the king, for her compassions were stirred toward her son. She said: \"Please, my lord! You should give her the living child! By no means put him to death!\" But the other woman was saying: \"He will be neither mine nor yours! Let them cut him in two!\" 27 At that the king answered: \"Give the living child to the first woman! By no means put him to death, for she is his mother.\"\n28 So all Israel heard about the judgment that the king had handed down, and they were in awe of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was with him to execute justice.\nChapter 4\n1 King Solomon ruled over all Israel. 2 These were his high officials: Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest; 3 Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 4 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in charge of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 5 Azariah the son of Nathan was over the deputies; Zabud the son of Nathan was a priest and the king's friend; 6 Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over those conscripted for forced labor.\n7 Solomon had 12 deputies in charge of all Israel who provided the king and his household with food. Each one was responsible for providing the food for one month of the year. 8 These were their names: The son of Hur, in the mountainous region of Ephraim; 9 the son of Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; 10 the son of Hesed, in Arubboth (he had Socoh and all the land of Hepher); 11 the son of Abinadab, in all the slopes of Dor (Solomon's daughter Taphath became his wife); 12 Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah to the region of Jokmeam; 13 the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the tent villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; he also had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan: 60 large cities with walls and copper bars); 14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he took Basemath, another of Solomon's daughters, as his wife); 16 Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 18 Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 19 Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. There was also one deputy in charge of all these other deputies in the land.\n20 Judah and Israel were as numerous as the grains of sand by the sea; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.\n21 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the boundary of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.\n22 Solomon's food for each day was 30 cor measures of fine flour and 60 cor measures of flour, 23 10 fattened cattle, 20 pastured cattle, and 100 sheep, besides some stags, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened cuckoos. 24 For he controlled everything this side of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, including all the kings on this side of the River; and he enjoyed peace in every region, all around him. 25 Judah and Israel lived in security, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.\n26 And Solomon had 4,000 stalls of horses for his chariots and 12,000 horses.\n27 These deputies supplied food to King Solomon and to everyone who ate at the table of King Solomon. Each was responsible for his month and saw to it that nothing was lacking. 28 They also brought barley and straw wherever it was needed for the horses and for the teams of horses, each according to his quota.\n29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and discernment in very great measure and a broadness of heart like the sand on the seashore. 30 Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt. 31 He was wiser than any other man, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; his fame spread among all the surrounding nations. 32 He composed 3,000 proverbs and his songs numbered 1,005. 33 He would speak about the trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he would speak about the animals, the birds, the creeping things, and the fish. 34 People from all the nations came to hear Solomon's wisdom, including kings from all over the earth who had heard about his wisdom.\nChapter 5\n1 When Hiram the king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed as king in place of his father, he sent his servants to Solomon, for Hiram had always been a friend of David's. 2 In turn Solomon sent word to Hiram: 3 \"You well know that David my father was not able to build a house for the name of Jehovah his God because of the wars waged against him from every side until Jehovah put his enemies under the soles of his feet. 4 But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on all sides. There is no one opposing me and nothing bad happening. 5 So I intend to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, just as Jehovah promised to David my father, saying: 'Your son whom I will put on your throne in your place, he is the one who will build the house for my name.' 6 Now command your people to cut cedars of Lebanon for me. My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set, for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the Sidonians.\"\n7 When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he rejoiced greatly and said: \"May Jehovah be praised today, for he has given David a wise son over this great people!\" 8 So Hiram sent word to Solomon: \"I have heard the message you sent to me. I will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers. 9 My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me. I will have them broken up there, and you can carry them away. In exchange, you will provide the food that I request for my household.\"\n10 So Hiram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that Solomon desired. 11 And Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cor measures of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil. That was what Solomon gave Hiram year after year. 12 And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, just as He had promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.\n13 King Solomon conscripted men for forced labor out of all Israel; 30,000 men were conscripted. 14 He would send them to Lebanon in shifts of 10,000 each month. They would spend a month in Lebanon and two months at their homes; and Adoniram was over those conscripted for forced labor. 15 Solomon had 70,000 common laborers and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, 16 as well as Solomon's 3,300 princely deputies who served as foremen to supervise the workmen. 17 At the king's order, they quarried large stones, expensive stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stones. 18 So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did the cutting, and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.\nChapter 6\n1 In the 480th year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year after Solomon became king over Israel, in the month of Ziv (that is, the second month), he began to build the house of Jehovah. 2 The house that King Solomon built for Jehovah was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. 3 The porch in front of the temple was 20 cubits long, corresponding to the width of the house. Its depth was ten cubits from the front of the house.\n4 He made windows of narrowing frames for the house. 5 Further, he built a side structure against the wall of the house; it went around the walls of the house, those of the temple and the innermost room, and he made side chambers all around. 6 The lowest level of the side chambers was five cubits wide, the middle level was six cubits wide, and the third level was seven cubits wide, for he made offsets all around the house, so that nothing was attached to the walls of the house.\n7 The house was built with quarry stone that had already been prepared, so that no hammers or axes or any iron tools were heard in the house while it was being built. 8 The entrance of the lowest side chamber was on the south side of the house, and a winding staircase led up to the middle floor, and from the middle floor up to the third floor. 9 He continued building the house and finished it and covered the house with cedar beams and rows of cedar planks. 10 He built the side chambers all around the house, each five cubits high, and they were joined to the house by cedar timbers.\n11 Meanwhile, the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying: 12 \"As for this house that you are building, if you walk in my statutes and carry out my judgments and observe all my commandments by walking in them, I will also carry out with you my promise that I made to David your father, 13 and I will reside in the midst of the Israelites, and I will not forsake my people Israel.\"\n14 Solomon continued building the house to finish it. 15 He built the inside walls of the house with cedar boards. He paneled the inside walls with timber, from the floor of the house up to the rafters of the ceiling, and he overlaid the floor of the house with juniper boards. 16 And he built a section of 20 cubits at the rear of the house with cedar boards, from the floor up to the rafters, and he built inside of it the innermost room, the Most Holy. 17 And the temple-the part of the house in front of it-was 40 cubits. 18 The cedar inside the house was carved with gourds and flowers in bloom. All of it was cedar; no stone was seen.\n19 And he prepared the innermost room inside the house to put there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. 20 The innermost room was 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 20 cubits high; and he overlaid it with pure gold; he overlaid the altar with cedar. 21 Solomon overlaid the interior of the house with pure gold, and he stretched gold chains in front of the innermost room, which was overlaid with gold. 22 He overlaid the whole house with gold until all the house was completed; he also overlaid with gold the entire altar near the innermost room.\n23 In the innermost room he made two cherubs of pinewood, each ten cubits high. 24 One wing of the cherub measured five cubits, and the other wing was five cubits. From the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing was ten cubits. 25 The second cherub was also ten cubits. The two cherubs had the same size and shape. 26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, as was that of the other cherub. 27 Then he put the cherubs inside the inner house. The wings of the cherubs were extended so that the wing of the one cherub reached to one wall and the wing of the other cherub reached to the other wall, and their wings extended toward the middle of the house, so that the wings touched. 28 And he overlaid the cherubs with gold.\n29 And on all the walls of the house all around both the inner and outer rooms, he carved figures of cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom. 30 He overlaid the floor of the house with gold in the inner and outer rooms. 31 And for the entrance of the innermost room he made doors of pinewood, side pillars, and doorposts, as a fifth part. 32 The two doors were of pinewood, and he carved on them cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom, and he overlaid them with gold; and he hammered the gold down over the cherubs and the palm trees. 33 For the entrance of the temple, that was how he made the doorposts of pinewood, belonging to a fourth part. 34 And he made two doors of juniper wood. The one door had two leaves that turned on pivots, and the other door had two leaves that turned on pivots. 35 He carved cherubs, palm trees, and flowers in bloom, and overlaid gold foil on the carvings.\n36 He built the inner courtyard with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.\n37 In the 4th year, in the month of Ziv, the house of Jehovah had its foundation laid; 38 and in the 11th year, in the month of Bul (that is, the eighth month), the house was finished in all its details and according to its plan. So he spent seven years building it.\nChapter 7\n1 And it took Solomon 13 years to build his own house, until his whole house was completed.\n2 And he built the House of the Forest of Lebanon 100 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high on four rows of cedar pillars; and there were cedar beams on the pillars. 3 It was paneled above with cedar on the girders that rested on the pillars; they numbered 45, with 15 to a row. 4 There were three rows of framed windows, and each window was opposite another window in three tiers. 5 All the entrances and the doorposts had square frames, as did the front of the windows that were opposite each other in three tiers.\n6 And he built the Hall of Pillars 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide, and there was a porch in front of it with pillars and a canopy.\n7 He also built the Hall of the Throne, where he would judge-the Hall of Judgment-and they paneled it with cedar from the floor to the rafters.\n8 The house where he was to live, at the other courtyard, was set back from the Hall, and it was similar in workmanship. He also built a house similar to this Hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken as a wife.\n9 All of these were made of expensive stones hewn according to measure, trimmed with stonesaws inside and out, from the foundation up to the coping, and outside as far as the great courtyard. 10 And the foundation was laid with very large, expensive stones; some stones measured ten cubits, and other stones, eight cubits. 11 And above these were expensive stones, hewn according to measure, as well as cedar. 12 Around the great courtyard were three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams, like that for the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah and the porch of the house.\n13 King Solomon sent for Hiram and brought him from Tyre. 14 He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a Tyrian coppersmith; and he had great skill, understanding, and experience for all kinds of work in copper. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.\n15 He cast the two pillars of copper; each pillar was 18 cubits high, and it took a measuring cord 12 cubits long to encircle each of the two pillars. 16 And he made two capitals cast in copper to put on the tops of the pillars. One capital was five cubits high, and the other capital was five cubits high. 17 The capital on top of each pillar had mesh network with wreathed chains; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. 18 And he made pomegranates in two rows around the one network to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; he did the same for both capitals. 19 The capitals on top of the pillars at the porch were of a lily pattern four cubits high. 20 The capitals were on the two pillars, just above the rounded portion adjoining the network; and there were 200 pomegranates in rows all around on each capital.\n21 He set up the pillars of the porch of the temple. He set up the right-hand pillar and named it Jachin, and then he set up the left-hand pillar and named it Boaz. 22 And the top of the pillars were of a lily pattern. So the work of the pillars was completed.\n23 Then he made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, 10 cubits from brim to brim and 5 cubits high, and it took a measuring line 30 cubits long to encircle it. 24 And there were ornamental gourds below its brim, completely encircling it, ten to a cubit all around the Sea, with two rows of the gourds cast in one piece with it. 25 It stood on 12 bulls, 3 facing north, 3 facing west, 3 facing south, and 3 facing east; and the Sea rested on them, and all their hindquarters were toward the center. 26 And its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It would hold 2,000 bath measures.\n27 Then he made the ten carriages of copper. Each carriage was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. 28 And this was how the carriages were constructed: They had side panels, and the side panels were between the crossbars. 29 And on the side panels between the crossbars were lions, bulls, and cherubs, and the same design was on the crossbars. Above and beneath the lions and the bulls were wreaths in relief. 30 And each carriage had four copper wheels and copper axles, and its four cornerpieces served as supports for them. Beneath the basin were the supports, cast with wreaths at the side of each. 31 Its opening was inside the crown, extending upward one cubit; and its opening was round, making up a stand of one and a half cubits, and on its mouth were engravings. And their side panels were square, not round. 32 The four wheels were below the side panels, and the supports of the wheels were attached to the carriage, and the height of each wheel was one and a half cubits. 33 And the wheels were made like chariot wheels. Their supports, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal. 34 There were four supports on the four corners of each carriage; its supports were cast as part of the carriage. 35 On top of the carriage was a circular band half a cubit high, and on the top of the carriage, its framing pieces and its side panels were cast as part of it. 36 On the surfaces of its framing pieces and on its side panels he engraved cherubs, lions, and palm trees according to the amount of space on each, with wreaths all around. 37 This is how he made the ten carriages; they were all cast alike, with the same measure and shape.\n38 He made ten copper basins; each could hold 40 bath measures. Each basin measured four cubits. There was one basin for each of the ten carriages. 39 Then he put five carriages on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house, and he placed the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast.\n40 Hiram also made the basins, the shovels, and the bowls.\nSo Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of Jehovah: 41 the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars; 42 the 400 pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the two pillars; 43 the ten carriages and the ten basins on the carriages; 44 the Sea and the 12 bulls beneath the Sea; 45 and the cans, the shovels, the bowls, and all the utensils, which Hiram made of polished copper for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah. 46 The king cast them in clay molds in the district of the Jordan, between Succoth and Zarethan.\n47 Solomon left all the utensils unweighed because they were in such great quantities. The weight of the copper was not ascertained. 48 Solomon made all the utensils for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold; the gold table on which to put the showbread; 49 the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left before the innermost room; and the blossoms, the lamps, and the snuffers, of gold; 50 the basins, the extinguishers, the bowls, the cups, and the fire holders, of pure gold; and the sockets for the doors of the inner house, that is, the Most Holy, and for the doors of the house of the temple, of gold.\n51 So King Solomon completed all the work he had to do for the house of Jehovah. Solomon then brought in the things that David his father had made holy, and he put the silver, the gold, and the articles into the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.\nChapter 8\n1 At that time Solomon congregated the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, the chieftains of the paternal houses of Israel. They came to King Solomon at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, that is, Zion. 2 All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the festival in the month of Ethanim, that is, the seventh month. 3 So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests lifted up the Ark. 4 They brought up the Ark of Jehovah, the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up. 5 King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel, who had been summoned to meet with him, were before the Ark. So many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered.\n6 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the innermost room of the house, the Most Holy, underneath the wings of the cherubs.\n7 Thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubs overshadowed the Ark and its poles. 8 The poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the Holy in front of the innermost room, but they were not visible from outside. And they are there to this day. 9 There was nothing in the Ark but the two stone tablets that Moses placed there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel while they were coming out of the land of Egypt.\n10 When the priests came out from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of Jehovah. 11 The priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah. 12 At that time Solomon said: \"Jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom. 13 I have successfully built a lofty house for you, an established place for you to dwell in forever.\"\n14 Then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood. 15 He said: \"May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, the one who by his own mouth promised my father David, and by his own hand has given fulfillment, saying, 16 'From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there, but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.' 17 And it was the heart's desire of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel. 18 But Jehovah said to my father David, 'It was your heart's desire to build a house for my name, and you did well to desire this in your heart. 19 However, you will not build the house, but your own son who is to be born to you is the one who will build the house for my name.' 20 Jehovah has carried out the promise that he made, for I have succeeded my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah promised. I have also built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel 21 and have set up a place there for the Ark containing the covenant that Jehovah made with our forefathers when he was bringing them out of the land of Egypt.\"\n22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel, and he spread his hands out to the heavens, 23 and he said: \"O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens above or on the earth beneath, keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart. 24 You have kept the promise that you made to your servant David my father. You made the promise with your own mouth, and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand. 25 And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant David my father when you said: 'There will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking before me, just as you have walked before me.' 26 And now, O God of Israel, let the promise that you made to your servant David my father prove trustworthy, please.\n27 \"But will God really dwell on the earth? Look! The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built! 28 Now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you today. 29 May your eyes be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which you said, 'My name will be there,' to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place. 30 And listen to your servant's request for favor and to the request by your people Israel that they pray toward this place, and may you hear from your dwelling place in the heavens; yes, may you hear and forgive.\n31 \"When a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath and is brought under liability to the oath, and while under the oath he comes before your altar in this house, 32 may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by pronouncing the wicked one guilty and bringing what he did on his own head, and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent and rewarding him according to his own righteousness.\n33 \"When your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you, and they return to you and glorify your name and pray and beg you for favor in this house, 34 may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to their forefathers.\n35 \"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you, and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled them, 36 may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants, of your people Israel, for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk; and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance.\n37 \"If a famine occurs in the land, or a pestilence, a scorching blight, mildew, swarming locusts, or voracious locusts; or if their enemy besieges them in any of the cities of the land or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs, 38 whatever prayer, whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people Israel (for each one knows the plague of his own heart) when they spread out their hands toward this house, 39 then may you hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and may you forgive and take action; and reward each one according to all his ways, for you know his heart (you alone truly know every human heart), 40 so that they may fear you all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers.\n41 \"Also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people Israel and who comes from a distant land because of your name 42 (for they will hear about your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm), and he comes and prays toward this house, 43 may you then listen from the heavens, your dwelling place, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as your people Israel do, and may know that your name has been called on this house that I have built.\n44 \"If your people go to war against their enemy in the way that you send them, and they pray to Jehovah in the direction of the city that you have chosen and toward the house that I have built for your name, 45 then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them.\n46 \"If they sin against you (for there is no man who does not sin), and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy, and their captors carry them off captive to the land of the enemy, far or near; 47 and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive, and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land of their captors, saying, 'We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,' 48 and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them off captive, and they pray to you in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and of the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name, 49 then hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, their prayer and their request for favor, and execute judgment for them 50 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, forgiving all their transgressions they committed against you. You will make them objects of pity before their captors, and they will pity them 51 (for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, from inside the iron-smelting furnace). 52 May your eyes be opened to your servant's request for favor and to the request for favor by your people Israel by listening whenever they call to you. 53 For you set them apart as your inheritance out of all the peoples of the earth, just as you declared through Moses your servant when you were bringing our forefathers out of Egypt, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\"\n54 And as soon as Solomon finished offering to Jehovah this entire prayer and request for favor, he rose up from before the altar of Jehovah, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out to the heavens. 55 He then stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: 56 \"Praised be Jehovah, who has given a resting-place to his people Israel, just as he promised. Not one word of all his good promise that he made through Moses his servant has failed. 57 May Jehovah our God be with us just as he was with our forefathers. May he not abandon us nor forsake us. 58 May he draw our heart toward himself, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his regulations, and his judgments, which he commanded our forefathers to observe. 59 And may these words of mine with which I have begged Jehovah for favor be near to Jehovah our God by day and night, that he may execute judgment for his servant and for his people Israel as each day requires, 60 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is the true God. There is no other! 61 So let your heart be complete with Jehovah our God by walking in his regulations and by keeping his commandments as on this day.\"\n62 Now the king and all Israel with him offered a grand sacrifice before Jehovah. 63 Solomon offered the communion sacrifices to Jehovah: He offered 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the Israelites inaugurated the house of Jehovah. 64 On that day the king had to sanctify the middle of the courtyard that is before the house of Jehovah, for there he had to offer up the burnt sacrifices, the grain offerings, and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices, because the copper altar that is before Jehovah was too small to contain the burnt sacrifices, the grain offerings, and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices. 65 At that time Solomon held the festival together with all Israel, a great congregation from Lebo-hamath down to the Wadi of Egypt, before Jehovah our God for 7 days and then another 7 days, 14 days in all. 66 On the following day, he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes rejoicing and feeling glad of heart over all the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David his servant and Israel his people.\nChapter 9\n1 As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of Jehovah, the house of the king, and everything Solomon desired to make, 2 Jehovah appeared to Solomon a second time, just as he had appeared to him in Gibeon. 3 Jehovah said to him: \"I have heard your prayer and your request for favor that you made before me. I have sanctified this house that you built by permanently putting my name there, and my eyes and my heart will always be there. 4 And you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, with integrity of heart and with uprightness, by doing everything I have commanded you, and you obey my regulations and my judgments, 5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying, 'There will never fail to be a man of your line sitting on the throne of Israel.' 6 But if you and your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before you, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, 7 I will cut Israel off from the surface of the land that I have given to them, and the house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become an object of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples. 8 And this house will become heaps of ruins. Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will whistle and say, 'Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house?' 9 Then they will say, 'It was because they abandoned Jehovah their God, who had brought their forefathers out of the land of Egypt, and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. That is why Jehovah brought all this calamity on them.'\"\n10 At the end of 20 years, during which Solomon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house of the king, 11 Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and juniper timbers and with as much gold as he desired, and King Solomon gave to Hiram 20 cities in the land of Galilee. 12 So Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but he was not satisfied with them. 13 He said: \"What sort of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?\" So they came to be called the Land of Cabul down to this day. 14 In the meantime, Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.\n15 This is the account of those whom King Solomon conscripted for forced labor to build the house of Jehovah, his own house, the Mound, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had come up and captured Gezer and had burned it with fire, and he had also killed the Canaanites dwelling in the city. So he gave it as a parting gift to his daughter, the wife of Solomon.) 17 Solomon built up Gezer, Lower Beth-horon, 18 Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, within the land, 19 as well as all of Solomon's storage cities, the chariot cities, the cities for the horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 20 As for all the people who were left from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not part of the people of Israel, 21 their descendants who were left in the land-those whom the Israelites had been unable to devote to destruction-were conscripted by Solomon for forced labor as slaves until this day. 22 But Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves, for they were his warriors, servants, princes, adjutants, and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen. 23 There were 550 chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of Solomon, the foremen over the people who were doing the work.\n24 But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the City of David to her own house that he had built for her; then he built the Mound.\n25 Three times a year Solomon offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices on the altar that he had built for Jehovah, also making sacrificial smoke on the altar, which was before Jehovah, so he completed the house.\n26 King Solomon also made a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is by Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom. 27 Hiram sent his own servants with the fleet of ships, experienced seamen, to serve along with the servants of Solomon. 28 They went to Ophir and took from there 420 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.\nChapter 10\n1 Now the queen of Sheba heard the report about Solomon in connection with the name of Jehovah, so she came to test him with perplexing questions. 2 She arrived in Jerusalem with a very impressive entourage, with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones. She went in to Solomon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart. 3 Solomon then answered all her questions. There was nothing too difficult for the king to explain to her.\n4 When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he built, 5 the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the table service of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers, and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah, she was left completely breathless. 6 So she said to the king: \"The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and about your wisdom was true. 7 But I did not put faith in the reports until I had come and had seen it with my own eyes. And look! I had not been told the half. You have far surpassed in wisdom and prosperity the report that I heard. 8 Happy are your men, and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly, listening to your wisdom! 9 May Jehovah your God be praised, who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on the throne of Israel. Because of Jehovah's everlasting love for Israel, he appointed you as king to administer justice and righteousness.\"\n10 Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a great amount of balsam oil and precious stones. Never again was such a quantity of balsam oil brought in as what the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.\n11 Hiram's fleet of ships that carried gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir algum timbers in very great quantity, and precious stones. 12 The king made from the algum timbers supports for the house of Jehovah and for the king's house, as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers. Such algum timbers have never again been brought in or seen down to this day.\n13 King Solomon also gave the queen of Sheba whatever she desired and asked for, in addition to what he gave her out of his own generosity. After that she left and returned to her own land, together with her servants.\n14 And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold, 15 besides that from the merchants and the profit from the traders and from all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land.\n16 King Solomon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold (600 shekels of gold went on each shield) 17 and 300 bucklers of alloyed gold (three minas of gold went on each buckler). Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.\n18 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with refined gold. 19 There were six steps to the throne, and the throne had a round canopy behind it, and there were armrests on both sides of the seat, and two lions were standing beside the armrests. 20 And there were 12 lions standing on the six steps, one at each end of the six steps. No other kingdom had made anything like it.\n21 All the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. There was nothing made of silver, for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solomon. 22 For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish on the sea along with Hiram's fleet. Once every three years, the fleet of ships of Tarshish would come loaded with gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.\n23 So King Solomon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 24 And people of all the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had put in his heart. 25 They would each bring a gift-articles of silver, articles of gold, garments, armor, balsam oil, horses, and mules-and this continued year after year.\n26 And Solomon kept accumulating chariots and horses; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem.\n27 The king made the silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones, and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the Shephelah.\n28 The horses of Solomon had been imported from Egypt, and the company of the king's merchants would obtain the horses in droves for one price. 29 Each chariot imported from Egypt cost 600 silver pieces, and a horse cost 150; in turn, they would export them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.\nChapter 11\n1 But King Solomon loved many foreign women besides the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women. 2 They were from the nations about whom Jehovah had said to the Israelites: \"You must not go in among them, and they should not come in among you, for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods.\" But Solomon clung to them and loved them. 3 And he had 700 wives who were princesses and 300 concubines, and his wives gradually inclined his heart. 4 In Solomon's old age, his wives inclined his heart to follow other gods, and his heart was not complete with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his father. 5 And Solomon followed after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom, the disgusting god of the Ammonites. 6 And Solomon did what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not follow Jehovah completely as David his father had done.\n7 It was then that Solomon built a high place to Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, on the mountain in front of Jerusalem and to Molech, the disgusting god of the Ammonites. 8 That was what he did for all his foreign wives who were making sacrificial smoke and sacrificing to their gods.\n9 Jehovah became furious at Solomon, because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice 10 and had warned him about this very thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not obey what Jehovah had commanded. 11 Jehovah now said to Solomon: \"Because you have done this and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes as I commanded you, I will surely rip the kingdom away from you, and I will give it to one of your servants. 12 However, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it in your lifetime. I will rip it out of the hand of your son, 13 but I will not rip away the entire kingdom. One tribe I will give to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.\"\n14 Jehovah then raised up a resister against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, of the royal family of Edom. 15 When David defeated Edom, Joab the chief of the army went up to bury the slain, and he tried to strike down every male in Edom. 16 (For Joab and all Israel stayed there for six months until he had done away with every male in Edom.) 17 But Hadad fled with some of his father's Edomite servants, and they went to Egypt; Hadad was then a young boy. 18 So they set out from Midian and came to Paran. They took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, assigned him a food allowance, and gave him land. 19 Hadad found favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, so much so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, Tahpenes the queen. 20 In time the sister of Tahpenes bore him a son, Genubath, and Tahpenes brought him up in the house of Pharaoh, and Genubath remained in the house of Pharaoh among the sons of Pharaoh.\n21 Hadad heard in Egypt that David had been laid to rest with his forefathers and that Joab the chief of the army had died. So Hadad said to Pharaoh: \"Send me away, so that I may go to my own land.\" 22 But Pharaoh said to him: \"What have you lacked with me that you now seek to go to your own land?\" To this he said: \"Nothing, but please send me away.\"\n23 God also raised up against Solomon another resister, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer the king of Zobah. 24 He gathered men to himself and became chief of a marauder band when David defeated them. So they went to Damascus and settled there and began reigning in Damascus. 25 And he became a resister of Israel all the days of Solomon, adding to the harm done by Hadad, and he abhorred Israel while he reigned over Syria.\n26 And there was Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, a servant of Solomon's whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow. He too began to rebel against the king. 27 This is why he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the Mound and had closed up the gap of the City of David his father. 28 Now this Jeroboam was a capable man. When Solomon saw that the young man was a hard worker, he made him overseer over all the compulsory service of the house of Joseph. 29 During that time Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Ahijah was wearing a new garment, and the two of them were by themselves in the field. 30 Ahijah took hold of the new garment he was wearing and ripped it into 12 pieces. 31 Then he said to Jeroboam:\n\"Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'Here I am ripping the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes. 32 But one tribe will remain his for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 33 I will do this because they have left me and are bowing down to Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, to Chemosh the god of Moab, and to Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes and observing my statutes and my judgments as his father David did. 34 But I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand, and I will keep him as a chieftain for all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, because he obeyed my commandments and my statutes. 35 But I will take the kingship out of the hand of his son and give it to you, that is, ten tribes. 36 To his son I will give one tribe, so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself as the place to put my name. 37 I will take you, and you will reign over all that you desire, and you will become king over Israel. 38 And if you obey all that I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by obeying my statutes and my commandments, just as David my servant did, I will also be with you. I will build you a lasting house, just as I have built for David, and I will give you Israel. 39 And I will humiliate the offspring of David because of this, but not always.'\"\n40 So Solomon tried to put Jeroboam to death, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.\n41 As for the rest of the history of Solomon, all that he did and his wisdom, is it not written in the book of the history of Solomon? 42 The length of Solomon's reign in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years. 43 Then Solomon was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David his father; and his son Rehoboam became king in his place.\nChapter 12\n1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2 As soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (he was still in Egypt because he had run off on account of King Solomon and was living in Egypt), 3 they sent for him. After that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came to Rehoboam and said: 4 \"Your father made our yoke harsh. But if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy yoke he put on us, we will serve you.\"\n5 At this he said to them: \"Go away for three days; then return to me.\" So the people went away. 6 King Rehoboam then consulted with the older men who had served his father Solomon while he was alive, saying: \"What advice would you give on how to reply to this people?\" 7 They answered him: \"If today you would become a servant to this people and submit to their request and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.\"\n8 However, he rejected the advice that the older men gave him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants. 9 He asked them: \"What advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me, 'Make the yoke your father put on us lighter'?\" 10 The young men who had grown up with him said to him: \"This is what you should say to this people who have said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter for us'; this is what you should tell them, 'My little finger will be thicker than my father's hips. 11 My father imposed a heavy yoke on you, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges.'\"\n12 Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had said: \"Return to me on the third day.\" 13 But the king answered the people harshly, rejecting the advice that the older men had given him. 14 He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying: \"My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges.\" 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was caused by Jehovah, in order to carry out the word that Jehovah had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n16 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people replied to the king: \"What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your gods, O Israel. Now look after your own house, O David!\" With that Israel returned to their homes. 17 But Rehoboam continued to reign over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.\n18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 19 And the Israelites have been in revolt against the house of David down to this day.\n20 As soon as all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. None of the people followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah.\n21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he immediately congregated all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 trained warriors, to fight against the house of Israel in order to restore the kingship to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 22 Then the word of the true God came to Shemaiah the man of the true God, saying: 23 \"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people, 24 'This is what Jehovah says: \"You must not go up and fight against your Israelite brothers. Each one of you must return to his house, for I have caused this to happen.\"'\" So they obeyed the word of Jehovah and went back home, as Jehovah had told them.\n25 Jeroboam then built up Shechem in the mountainous region of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Penuel. 26 Jeroboam said in his heart: \"Now the kingdom will return to the house of David. 27 If this people continues to go up to offer sacrifices at the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, the heart of this people will also return to their lord, King Rehoboam of Judah. Yes, they will kill me and return to King Rehoboam of Judah.\" 28 After consultation, the king made two golden calves and said to the people: \"It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\" 29 Then he placed one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. 30 And this caused them to sin, and the people went as far as Dan to worship the one there.\n31 And he made houses of worship on the high places and appointed priests from the people in general, those who were not Levites. 32 Jeroboam also established a festival in the eighth month, on the 15th day of the month, like the festival in Judah. On the altar that he made at Bethel, he sacrificed to the calves he had made, and at Bethel he assigned priests for the high places that he had made. 33 And he began to make offerings on the altar that he had made at Bethel on the 15th day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised on his own; and he established a festival for the people of Israel, and he ascended the altar to make offerings and sacrificial smoke.\nChapter 13\n1 By the word of Jehovah, a man of God came from Judah to Bethel while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make sacrificial smoke. 2 Then he called out against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said: \"O altar, altar! This is what Jehovah says: 'Look! A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David! He will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places, those making sacrificial smoke on you, and he will burn human bones on you.'\" 3 He gave a sign on that day, saying: \"This is the sign that Jehovah has declared: Look! The altar will be ripped apart, and the ashes that are on it will be spilled out.\"\n4 As soon as the king heard the word that the man of the true God had called out against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar and said: \"Seize him!\" Immediately, the hand that he had stretched out against him dried up, and he could not draw it back. 5 Then the altar was ripped apart and the ashes were spilled out from the altar according to the sign that the man of the true God had given by the word of Jehovah.\n6 The king now said to the man of the true God: \"Please, beg for the favor of Jehovah your God, and pray in my behalf that my hand may be restored to me.\" At this the man of the true God begged for the favor of Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored to its former condition. 7 The king then said to the man of the true God: \"Come home with me and take some food, and let me give you a gift.\" 8 But the man of the true God said to the king: \"Even if you gave me half your house, I would not come with you and eat bread or drink water in this place. 9 For this is what I was commanded by the word of Jehovah: 'You must not eat bread or drink water, and you must not return by the way you came.'\" 10 So he left by another way, and he did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.\n11 There was a certain old prophet dwelling in Bethel, and his sons came home and related to him all the things that the man of the true God had done that day in Bethel and the words he had spoken to the king. After they related this to their father, 12 their father asked them: \"Which way did he go?\" So his sons showed him the way that the man of the true God from Judah had gone. 13 He now said to his sons: \"Saddle the donkey for me.\" They saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.\n14 He followed the man of the true God and found him sitting under a big tree. Then he said to him: \"Are you the man of the true God who came from Judah?\" He replied: \"I am.\" 15 He said to him: \"Come home with me and eat bread.\" 16 But he said: \"I cannot go back with you or accept your invitation, nor may I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 17 For I was told by the word of Jehovah, 'You must not eat bread or drink water there. You must not return by the way you came.'\" 18 At this he said to him: \"I too am a prophet like you, and an angel told me by the word of Jehovah, 'Have him come back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'\" (He deceived him.) 19 So he went back with him to eat bread and drink water in his house.\n20 While they were sitting at the table, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet who had brought him back, 21 and he called out to the man of the true God from Judah, saying, \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Because you rebelled against the order of Jehovah and did not keep the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you, 22 but you went back to eat bread and drink water in the place about which you were told, \"Do not eat bread or drink water,\" your dead body will not come into the tomb of your forefathers.'\"\n23 After the man of the true God ate bread and drank, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. 24 Then he got on his way, but a lion came across him on the road and killed him. His dead body was thrown onto the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion was also standing beside the dead body. 25 There were men passing by who saw the dead body thrown onto the road and the lion standing beside the dead body. They came in and told about it in the city where the old prophet lived.\n26 When the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard of it, he immediately said: \"It is the man of the true God who rebelled against the order of Jehovah; so Jehovah gave him over to the lion, to maul and to kill him, according to the word of Jehovah that he spoke to him.\" 27 He then said to his sons: \"Saddle the donkey for me.\" So they saddled it. 28 Then he went on his way and found the dead body thrown onto the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the dead body, nor had it mauled the donkey. 29 The prophet lifted up the dead body of the man of the true God and put him on the donkey, and he brought him back into his own city to mourn and bury him. 30 So he laid the dead body in his own tomb, and they kept crying out over him: \"Too bad, my brother!\" 31 After burying him, he told his sons: \"When I die, you must bury me in the place where the man of the true God is buried. Lay my bones next to his bones. 32 The word that he called out by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of worship on the high places in the cities of Samaria is sure to take place.\"\n33 Even after this happened, Jeroboam did not turn back from his bad way, but he kept appointing priests for the high places from the people in general. He would install as priests anyone who so desired, saying: \"Let him become one of the priests for the high places.\" 34 This sin on the part of the household of Jeroboam led to their destruction and annihilation from the face of the earth.\nChapter 14\n1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 2 So Jeroboam said to his wife: \"Rise up, please, and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are Jeroboam's wife, and go to Shiloh. Look! Ahijah the prophet is there. He is the one who spoke of me becoming king over this people. 3 Take with you ten loaves of bread, sprinkled cakes, and a flask of honey, and go to him. He will then tell you what is going to happen to the boy.\"\n4 Jeroboam's wife did what he said. She rose up and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Ahijah's eyes stared straight ahead, and he could not see because of his age.\n5 But Jehovah had told Ahijah: \"Here is the wife of Jeroboam coming to inquire of you regarding her son, for he is sick. I will tell you what to say to her. When she arrives, she will conceal her identity.\"\n6 As soon as Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she was coming into the entrance, he said: \"Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you concealing your identity? I have been assigned to give you a harsh message. 7 Go, tell Jeroboam, 'This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: \"I raised you up from among your people to make you a leader over my people Israel. 8 Then I ripped the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you have not become like my servant David, who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. 9 But you have done worse than all those who were prior to you, and you made for yourself another god and metal images to offend me, and it is I whom you have turned your back on. 10 For that reason I am bringing calamity on the house of Jeroboam, and I will annihilate from Jeroboam every male, including the helpless and weak in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jeroboam, just as one clears away the dung until it is all gone! 11 Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and anyone who dies in the field, the birds of the heavens will eat, for Jehovah has spoken it.\"'\n12 \"Now rise up; go to your house. When you set foot in the city, the child will die. 13 All Israel will mourn him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam's family will be laid in a grave, because he is the only one of the house of Jeroboam in whom Jehovah the God of Israel has found something good. 14 Jehovah will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will do away with the house of Jeroboam from that day forward, yes, even now. 15 Jehovah will strike Israel down like a reed that sways in the water, and he will uproot Israel off this good land that he gave to their forefathers, and he will scatter them beyond the River, because they made their sacred poles, offending Jehovah. 16 And he will abandon Israel because of the sins that Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.\"\n17 At that Jeroboam's wife rose up and went on her way and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the boy died. 18 So they buried him, and all Israel mourned him, according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken through his servant Ahijah the prophet.\n19 And the rest of the history of Jeroboam, how he waged war and how he reigned, is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel. 20 And the length of Jeroboam's reign was 22 years, after which he was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Nadab became king in his place.\n21 Meanwhile, Rehoboam the son of Solomon had become king in Judah. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name. The name of Rehoboam's mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 22 And Judah was doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and by the sins they committed they provoked him more than their forefathers had done. 23 They too kept building for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and sacred poles on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree. 24 There were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They acted according to all the detestable things of the nations that Jehovah had driven out before the Israelites.\n25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. 26 He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king's house. He took everything, including all the gold shields that Solomon had made. 27 So King Rehoboam made copper shields to replace them, and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard, who guarded the entrance of the king's house. 28 Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah, the guards would carry them, and then they would return them to the guard chamber.\n29 And the rest of the history of Rehoboam, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 30 There was constant warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 31 Then Rehoboam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And his son Abijam became king in his place.\nChapter 15\n1 In the 18th year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. 2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the granddaughter of Abishalom. 3 He went on walking in all the sins that his father committed prior to him, and his heart was not complete with Jehovah his God like the heart of David his forefather. 4 However, on account of David, Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him and keeping Jerusalem in existence. 5 For David did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not turn aside from anything that He had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 6 And there was warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.\n7 As for the rest of the history of Abijam, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? There was also war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 8 Then Abijam was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and his son Asa became king in his place.\n9 In the 20th year of King Jeroboam of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah. 10 He reigned in Jerusalem for 41 years. His grandmother's name was Maacah the granddaughter of Abishalom. 11 Asa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his forefather. 12 He expelled the male temple prostitutes from the land and removed all the disgusting idols that his forefathers had made. 13 He even removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole. Asa cut down her obscene idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 14 But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless, Asa's heart was complete with Jehovah all his life. 15 And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of Jehovah-silver, gold, and various utensils.\n16 There was constant warfare between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel. 17 So King Baasha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah. 18 At that Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the house of the king and handed them over to his servants. King Asa then sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon the son of Hezion, the king of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying: 19 \"There is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father. I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Come, break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.\" 20 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they struck down Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, all Chinnereth, and all the land of Naphtali. 21 When Baasha heard of it, he immediately quit building Ramah and continued dwelling in Tirzah. 22 King Asa then summoned all Judah-no one was exempt-and they carried off the stones and timbers of Ramah that Baasha had been building with, and with them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and Mizpah.\n23 As for all the rest of the history of Asa, all his mightiness and all that he did and the cities that he built, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? But in his old age he suffered from a disease in his feet. 24 Then Asa was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with them in the City of David his forefather; and his son Jehoshaphat became king in his place.\n25 Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years. 26 He kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit. 27 Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon. 28 So Baasha put him to death in the third year of King Asa of Judah and became king in his place. 29 And as soon as he became king, he struck down all the house of Jeroboam. He did not let remain anyone breathing who belonged to Jeroboam; he had them annihilated according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. 30 This was because of the sins that Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit and because he had greatly offended Jehovah the God of Israel. 31 As for the rest of the history of Nadab, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 32 And there was constant warfare between Asa and King Baasha of Israel.\n33 In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king in Tirzah over all Israel and reigned for 24 years. 34 But he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit.\nChapter 16\n1 The word of Jehovah against Baasha then came to Jehu the son of Hanani, saying: 2 \"I raised you up out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, but you kept walking in the way of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin so that they offended me with their sins. 3 So I am making a clean sweep of Baasha and his house, and I will make his house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 4 Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat; and anyone belonging to him who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat.\"\n5 As for the rest of the history of Baasha, what he did and his mightiness, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 6 Then Baasha was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son became king in his place. 7 Also through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani, Jehovah's word came against Baasha and his house, both because of all the badness that he committed in the eyes of Jehovah by offending him with the work of his hands, becoming like the house of Jeroboam, and also because of his striking him down.\n8 In the 26th year of King Asa of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned for two years. 9 His servant Zimri, the chief of half of his chariot forces, conspired against him while he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk at the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah. 10 Zimri came in and struck him down and put him to death in the 27th year of King Asa of Judah, and he became king in his place. 11 When he became king, as soon as he sat down on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not spare a single male, whether of his relatives or of his friends. 12 Thus Zimri annihilated the whole house of Baasha, according to the word that Jehovah had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet. 13 This was for all the sins that Baasha and his son Elah had committed and the sins they had caused Israel to commit by offending Jehovah the God of Israel with their worthless idols. 14 As for the rest of the history of Elah, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel?\n15 In the 27th year of King Asa of Judah, Zimri became king for seven days in Tirzah while the troops were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 16 In time the troops who were encamped heard it being said: \"Zimri has conspired and has also struck down the king.\" So all Israel made Omri, the chief of the army, king over Israel on that day in the camp. 17 Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah. 18 When Zimri saw that the city had been captured, he went into the fortified tower of the king's house and burned the house down over himself, and he died. 19 This was for his own sins that he had committed by doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah by walking in the way of Jeroboam and for the sin he had caused Israel to commit. 20 As for the rest of the history of Zimri and his conspiracy, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel?\n21 It was then that the people of Israel were divided into two factions. One part of the people became followers of Tibni the son of Ginath, wanting to make him king, and the other part followed Omri. 22 But the people who were following Omri prevailed over the people following Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king.\n23 In the 31st year of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and he reigned for 12 years. In Tirzah he reigned for six years. 24 He bought the mountain of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he built a city on the mountain. He named the city that he built Samaria, after Shemer the owner of the mountain. 25 Omri kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he was worse than all who were prior to him. 26 He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in the sin he had caused Israel to commit by offending Jehovah the God of Israel with their worthless idols. 27 As for the rest of the history of Omri, what he did and his mighty exploits, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 28 Then Omri was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in Samaria; and his son Ahab became king in his place.\n29 Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the 38th year of King Asa of Judah, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria for 22 years. 30 Ahab the son of Omri was worse in the eyes of Jehovah than all those who were prior to him. 31 As if it were a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he also took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and to bow down to him. 32 Further, he set up an altar to Baal at the house of Baal that he built in Samaria. 33 Ahab also made the sacred pole. Ahab did more to offend Jehovah the God of Israel than all the kings of Israel prior to him.\n34 In his days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his youngest he put up its doors, according to the word of Jehovah spoken through Joshua the son of Nun.\nChapter 17\n1 Now Elijah the Tishbite, an inhabitant of Gilead, said to Ahab: \"As surely as Jehovah the God of Israel whom I serve is living, during these years there will be no dew or rain except by my word!\"\n2 The word of Jehovah came to him, saying: 3 \"Leave here, and turn eastward and hide at the Valley of Cherith, east of the Jordan. 4 You should drink from the stream, and I will command the ravens to supply you food there.\" 5 He immediately went and did according to the word of Jehovah; he went and stayed by the Valley of Cherith, east of the Jordan. 6 And the ravens were bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the stream. 7 But after some days, the stream ran dry, because there was no rain in the land.\n8 The word of Jehovah then came to him: 9 \"Rise up, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Look! I will command a widow there to supply you with food.\" 10 So he rose up and went to Zarephath. When he came to the entrance of the city, there was a widow gathering pieces of wood. So he called to her and said: \"Please, bring me a little water in a cup so that I may drink.\" 11 As she went to get it, he called to her: \"Please, bring me a piece of bread in your hand.\" 12 At this she said: \"As surely as Jehovah your God is living, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in the large jar and a little oil in the small jar. Now I am gathering a few pieces of wood, and I will go in and make something for me and my son. After we have eaten, we will die.\"\n13 Then Elijah said to her: \"Do not be afraid. Go in and do as you said. But first make me a small round loaf of bread with what is there, and bring it out to me. Then you can make something afterward for you and your son. 14 For this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'The large jar of flour will not run out, and the small jar of oil will not run dry until the day Jehovah makes it rain on the surface of the ground.'\" 15 So she went and did as Elijah said, and she together with him and her household ate for many days. 16 The large jar of flour did not run out, and the small jar of oil did not run dry, according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken through Elijah.\n17 After these things, the son of the woman who owned the house fell sick, and his sickness became so severe that he stopped breathing. 18 At this she said to Elijah: \"What do you have against me, O man of the true God? Have you come to remind me of my guilt and to put my son to death?\" 19 But he said to her: \"Give me your son.\" Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the roof chamber, where he was staying, and he laid him on his own bed. 20 He called out to Jehovah: \"O Jehovah my God, are you also bringing harm to the widow with whom I am staying by putting her son to death?\" 21 Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and called out to Jehovah: \"O Jehovah my God, please, let this child's life come back into him.\" 22 Jehovah listened to Elijah's request, and the life of the child came back into him, and he revived. 23 Elijah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said: \"See, your son is alive.\" 24 At that the woman said to Elijah: \"Now I know that you truly are a man of God and that Jehovah's word in your mouth is truth.\"\nChapter 18\n1 After some time, in the third year, Jehovah's word came to Elijah, saying: \"Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the surface of the ground.\" 2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab, while the famine was severe in Samaria.\n3 Meanwhile, Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah greatly feared Jehovah, 4 and when Jezebel was doing away with Jehovah's prophets, Obadiah took 100 prophets and hid them 50 to a cave, and he supplied them with bread and water.) 5 Ahab then said to Obadiah: \"Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we can find enough grass to keep the horses and mules alive and not have all our animals die.\" 6 So they divided between themselves the land they were going to pass through. Ahab went alone by one way, and Obadiah went alone by another way.\n7 As Obadiah was on his way, Elijah was there to meet him. At once he recognized him and fell facedown and said: \"Is this you, my lord Elijah?\" 8 He replied to him: \"It is I. Go and tell your lord: 'Elijah is here.'\" 9 But he said: \"What sin have I committed that you should hand your servant over to Ahab to put me to death? 10 As surely as Jehovah your God is living, there is not a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent to look for you. After they said, 'He is not here,' he made the kingdom and the nation swear that they could not find you. 11 Now you are saying, 'Go and tell your lord: \"Elijah is here.\"' 12 When I depart from you, the spirit of Jehovah will carry you away to a place I will not know, and when I tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will surely kill me. Yet, your servant has feared Jehovah from his youth. 13 Has my lord not been told what I did when Jezebel was killing the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid 100 of the prophets of Jehovah by groups of 50 in a cave and kept supplying them bread and water? 14 But now you are saying, 'Go and tell your lord: \"Elijah is here.\"' He will certainly kill me.\" 15 However, Elijah said: \"As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve is living, today I will present myself to him.\"\n16 So Obadiah went off to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\n17 As soon as Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him: \"Is this you, the one bringing great trouble on Israel?\"\n18 To this he said: \"I have not brought trouble on Israel, but you and the house of your father have, by abandoning the commandments of Jehovah and by following the Baals. 19 And now summon all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, as well as the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the sacred pole, who are eating at the table of Jezebel.\" 20 So Ahab sent word among all the people of Israel and collected the prophets together at Mount Carmel.\n21 Then Elijah approached all the people and said: \"How long will you be limping between two different opinions? If Jehovah is the true God, follow him; but if Baal is, follow him!\" But the people did not say a word in answer to him. 22 Elijah then said to the people: \"I am the only prophet of Jehovah left, while the prophets of Baal are 450 men. 23 Let them give us two young bulls, and let them choose one young bull and cut it into pieces and put it on the wood, but they should not put fire to it. I will prepare the other young bull, and I will place it on the wood, but I will not put fire to it. 24 Then you must call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah. The God who answers by fire will show that he is the true God.\" To this all the people answered: \"What you say is good.\"\n25 Elijah now said to the prophets of Baal: \"Choose one young bull and prepare it first, because you are the majority. Then call on the name of your god, but you must not put fire to it.\" 26 So they took the young bull that was given to them, prepared it, and kept calling on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying: \"O Baal, answer us!\" But there was no voice and no one answering. They kept limping around the altar that they had made. 27 About noon Elijah began to mock them and say: \"Call out at the top of your voice! After all, he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought or he has gone to relieve himself. Or maybe he is asleep and someone needs to wake him up!\" 28 They were calling out at the top of their voice and cutting themselves with daggers and lances, according to their custom, until their blood gushed out all over them. 29 Noon was past and they continued in a frenzy until the time the evening grain offering is presented, but there was no voice and no one answering; no one was paying attention.\n30 At length Elijah said to all the people: \"Approach me.\" So all the people approached him. Then he repaired the altar of Jehovah that had been torn down. 31 Elijah then took 12 stones, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Jehovah's word had come, saying: \"Israel will be your name.\" 32 With the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah. Then he made a trench all around the altar, an area large enough to sow with two seah measures of seed. 33 After that he put the pieces of wood in order, cut the young bull into pieces, and placed it on the wood. He now said: \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the pieces of wood.\" 34 Then he said: \"Do it again.\" So they did it again. Once more he said: \"Do it a third time.\" So they did it a third time. 35 And the water ran all around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.\n36 About the time when the evening grain offering is presented, Elijah the prophet stepped forward and said: \"O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and that it is by your word that I have done all these things. 37 Answer me, O Jehovah! Answer me so that this people may know that you, Jehovah, are the true God and that you are turning their hearts back to you.\"\n38 At that the fire of Jehovah fell from above and consumed the burnt offering, the pieces of wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water from the trench. 39 When all the people saw it, they immediately fell facedown and said: \"Jehovah is the true God! Jehovah is the true God!\" 40 Then Elijah said to them: \"Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let a single one of them escape!\" At once they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the stream of Kishon and slaughtered them there.\n41 Elijah now said to Ahab: \"Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy downpour.\" 42 So Ahab went up to eat and drink, while Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and crouched on the ground, keeping his face between his knees. 43 Then he said to his attendant: \"Go up, please, and look toward the sea.\" So he went up and looked and said: \"There is nothing at all.\" Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" 44 The seventh time his attendant said: \"Look! There is a small cloud like a man's hand ascending out of the sea.\" He now said: \"Go, say to Ahab, 'Hitch up the chariot! Go down so that the downpour may not detain you!'\" 45 Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds, the wind blew, and a heavy downpour fell; and Ahab kept riding and made his way to Jezreel. 46 But the hand of Jehovah came on Elijah, and he wrapped his garment around his hips and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.\nChapter 19\n1 Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 2 At that Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying: \"So may the gods do to me and add to it if by this time tomorrow I do not make you like each one of them!\" 3 At that he became afraid, so he got up and ran for his life. He came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and he left his attendant there. 4 He went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree, and he asked that he might die. He said: \"It is enough! Now, O Jehovah, take my life away, for I am no better than my forefathers.\"\n5 Then he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree. But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him: \"Get up and eat.\" 6 When he looked, there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones and a jug of water. He ate and drank and lay down again. 7 Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said: \"Get up and eat, for the journey will be too much for you.\" 8 So he got up and ate and drank, and in the strength of that nourishment he went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of the true God.\n9 There he entered a cave and spent the night; and look! Jehovah's word came to him, telling him: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" 10 To this he said: \"I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, and I am the only one left. Now they are seeking to take my life away.\" 11 But He said: \"Go out and stand on the mountain before Jehovah.\" And look! Jehovah was passing by, and a great and strong wind was splitting mountains and breaking crags before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake. 12 After the earthquake, there was a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a calm, low voice. 13 As soon as Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his official garment and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice asked him: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" 14 To this he said: \"I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies; for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your altars they have torn down, and your prophets they have killed with the sword, and I am the only one left. Now they are seeking to take my life away.\"\n15 Jehovah said to him: \"Return, and go to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, anoint Hazael as king over Syria. 16 And you should anoint Jehu the grandson of Nimshi as king over Israel, and you should anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah as prophet to take your place. 17 Anyone escaping from Hazael's sword, Jehu will put to death; and anyone escaping from Jehu's sword, Elisha will put to death. 18 And I still have left 7,000 in Israel, all whose knees have not bent down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.\"\n19 So he went from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat while he was plowing with 12 pairs of bulls ahead of him, and he was with the 12th pair. So Elijah went over to him and threw his official garment on him. 20 At that he left the bulls and ran after Elijah and said: \"Please, let me kiss my father and my mother. Then I will follow you.\" He replied to him: \"Go, return, for what have I done to stop you?\" 21 So he went back and took a pair of bulls and sacrificed them, and he used the plowing gear to boil the meat of the bulls and gave it to the people, and they ate. After that he rose up and followed Elijah and began to minister to him.\nChapter 20\n1 Now King Ben-hadad of Syria gathered his whole army together along with 32 other kings and their horses and chariots; he went up and laid siege to Samaria and fought against it. 2 Then he sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel at the city and said to him: \"This is what Ben-hadad says, 3 'Your silver and your gold are mine, as well as the best of your wives and your sons.'\" 4 To this the king of Israel answered: \"According to your word, my lord the king, I am yours along with all that belongs to me.\"\n5 The messengers later came back and said: \"This is what Ben-hadad says, 'I sent this message to you: \"Your silver, your gold, your wives, and your sons you will give me.\" 6 But about this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you, and they will carefully search your house and the houses of your servants, and all your desirable things they will seize and take away.'\"\n7 At that the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said: \"Take note, please, and see that this man is bent on bringing calamity, for he demanded my wives, my sons, my silver, and my gold, and I did not refuse him.\" 8 Then all the elders and all the people said to him: \"Do not obey, and do not consent.\" 9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad: \"Say to my lord the king, 'All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this I cannot do.'\" With that the messengers went off and brought word back to him.\n10 Ben-hadad now sent him this message: \"So may the gods do to me and add to it if there is enough dust in Samaria to give each of the people following me a handful!\" 11 The king of Israel answered: \"Tell him, 'The one who puts on his armor should not boast about himself like one who takes it off.'\" 12 As soon as he heard this reply, while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, he said to his servants: \"Get ready to attack!\" So they got ready to attack the city.\n13 But a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Have you seen all this large crowd? Here I am giving it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am Jehovah.'\" 14 Ahab asked: \"By whom?\" to which he said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'By the attendants of the princes of the provinces.'\" So he asked: \"Who will start the battle?\" to which he said: \"You!\"\n15 Ahab then counted the attendants of the princes of the provinces, and they were 232; after that, he counted all the Israelite men, 7,000. 16 They went out at noon while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the tents along with the 32 kings who were helping him. 17 When the attendants of the princes of the provinces came out first, Ben-hadad at once sent messengers. They reported to him: \"Men have come out from Samaria.\" 18 At that he said: \"If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for battle, you should still take them alive.\" 19 But when these came out of the city-the attendants of the princes of the provinces and the armies that were following them- 20 each one struck down his opponent. Then the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but King Ben-hadad of Syria escaped on a horse with some of the horsemen. 21 But the king of Israel went out and kept striking down the horses and the chariots, and he inflicted a great defeat on the Syrians.\n22 Later the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him: \"Go, strengthen yourself and consider what you are going to do, for at the start of the next year the king of Syria will come up against you.\"\n23 Now the servants of the king of Syria said to him: \"Their God is a God of mountains. That is why they overpowered us. But if we fight against them on level land, we will overpower them. 24 Also do this: Remove all the kings from their places, and replace them with governors. 25 Then gather an army equal to the army you lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Let us fight against them on level land, and we will surely overpower them.\" So he listened to their advice and did just that.\n26 At the start of the year, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek for battle against Israel. 27 The people of Israel were also mustered and supplied, and they went out to meet them. When the people of Israel camped in front of them, they were like two tiny flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the whole land. 28 Then the man of the true God approached the king of Israel and said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Because the Syrians have said: \"Jehovah is a God of mountains, and he is not a God of plains,\" I will give all this large crowd into your hand, and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah.'\"\n29 They remained encamped opposite each other for seven days, and on the seventh day the battle began. The people of Israel struck down 100,000 Syrian foot soldiers in one day. 30 And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city. But the wall fell down on 27,000 of the men who were left. Ben-hadad also fled and came into the city, and he hid in an inner room.\n31 So his servants said to him: \"Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please, let us wear sackcloth on our hips and put ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.\" 32 So they wore sackcloth around their hips and ropes on their heads and came in to the king of Israel and said: \"Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please, let me live.'\" He replied: \"Is he still alive? He is my brother.\" 33 The men took it as an omen and quickly took him at his word, so they said: \"Ben-hadad is your brother.\" At that he said: \"Go and get him.\" Then Ben-hadad went out to him, and he had him get up into the chariot.\n34 Ben-hadad now said to him: \"The cities that my father took from your father I will return, and you may establish markets for yourself in Damascus, just as my father did in Samaria.\"\nAhab replied: \"On the basis of this agreement, I will let you go.\"\nWith that he made an agreement with him and let him go.\n35 By the word of Jehovah, one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion: \"Strike me, please.\" But the man refused to strike him. 36 So he said to him: \"Because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.\" After he left him, a lion came upon him and killed him.\n37 He found another man and said: \"Strike me, please.\" So the man struck him and wounded him.\n38 Then the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. 39 As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king: \"Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and there was a man coming out who brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man. If he is found missing, your life will have to take the place of his life, or else you will pay a talent of silver.' 40 And while your servant was busy here and there, suddenly the man was gone.\" The king of Israel said to him: \"So your own judgment will be; you have decided it yourself.\" 41 Then he quickly removed the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets. 42 He said to him: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Because you have let the man who I said should be destroyed escape from your hand, your life must take the place of his life, and your people the place of his people.'\" 43 At that the king of Israel went home to Samaria, sullen and dejected.\nChapter 21\n1 After these things, an incident took place concerning a vineyard that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite; it was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab the king of Samaria. 2 Ahab said to Naboth: \"Give me your vineyard for me to use as a vegetable garden, for it is near my house. Then I will give you a better vineyard to replace it. Or if you prefer, I will give you its value in money.\" 3 But Naboth said to Ahab: \"It is unthinkable, from Jehovah's standpoint, for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers.\" 4 So Ahab came into his house, sullen and dejected over the answer that Naboth the Jezreelite had given him when he said: \"I will not give you the inheritance of my forefathers.\" Then he lay down on his bed, kept his face turned away, and refused to eat.\n5 His wife Jezebel came in to him and asked him: \"Why are you so sad that you refuse to eat?\" 6 He replied to her: \"Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Give me your vineyard for money. Or if you prefer, let me give you another vineyard to replace it.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'\" 7 His wife Jezebel said to him: \"Are you not the one ruling as king over Israel? Get up, eat something, and let your heart be cheerful. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\" 8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived in Naboth's city. 9 She wrote in the letters: \"Proclaim a fast, and have Naboth sit at the head of the people. 10 And have two good-for-nothing men sit in front of him and testify against him, saying, 'You have cursed God and the king!' Then bring him out and stone him to death.\"\n11 So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did just as was written in the letters that Jezebel sent to them. 12 They proclaimed a fast and had Naboth sit at the head of the people. 13 Then two of the good-for-nothing men came in and sat down in front of him and began to testify against Naboth in front of the people, saying: \"Naboth has cursed God and the king!\" After that they brought him to the outskirts of the city and stoned him to death. 14 They now sent word to Jezebel, saying: \"Naboth has been stoned to death.\"\n15 As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab: \"Get up, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is no longer alive. He is dead.\" 16 As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.\n17 But Jehovah's word came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 18 \"Get up, go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel, who is in Samaria. There he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession of it. 19 You must tell him, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Have you murdered a man and also taken his property?\"' Then say to him, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, the dogs will lick up your own blood.\"'\"\n20 Ahab said to Elijah: \"So you have found me, O my enemy!\" He replied: \"I have found you. 'Because you are determined to do what is bad in the eyes of Jehovah, 21 here I am bringing calamity upon you, and I will make a clean sweep after you and will annihilate from Ahab every male, including the helpless and weak in Israel. 22 And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for you have provoked my anger and have caused Israel to sin.' 23 Also concerning Jezebel, Jehovah has said: 'The dogs will eat up Jezebel in the plot of land of Jezreel. 24 Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs will eat up, and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the heavens will eat up. 25 Indeed, there has never been anyone like Ahab, who was so determined to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, egged on by his wife Jezebel. 26 He acted in the most detestable way by going after the disgusting idols, just as all the Amorites had done, whom Jehovah drove out from before the Israelites.'\"\n27 As soon as Ahab heard these words, he ripped his garments apart and put sackcloth on his body; and he went on a fast and kept lying down in sackcloth and walking despondently. 28 Jehovah's word then came to Elijah the Tishbite: 29 \"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself on my account? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the calamity during his lifetime. I will bring the calamity upon his house in the days of his son.\"\nChapter 22\n1 For three years there was no war between Syria and Israel. 2 In the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah went down to the king of Israel. 3 Then the king of Israel said to his servants: \"Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us? And yet we are hesitating to take it back from the king of Syria.\" 4 He then said to Jehoshaphat: \"Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth-gilead?\" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel: \"I am the same as you. My people are the same as your people. My horses are the same as your horses.\"\n5 But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: \"First inquire, please, for the word of Jehovah.\" 6 So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about 400 men, and said to them: \"Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?\" They said: \"Go up, and Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.\"\n7 Jehoshaphat then said: \"Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah? Let us also inquire through him.\" 8 At that the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: \"There is still one more man through whom we can inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good things concerning me, only bad. He is Micaiah the son of Imlah.\" However, Jehoshaphat said: \"The king should not say such a thing.\"\n9 So the king of Israel called a court official and said: \"Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly.\" 10 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in royal attire, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 11 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself iron horns and said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'With these you will gore the Syrians until you exterminate them.'\" 12 All the other prophets were prophesying the same way, saying: \"Go up to Ramoth-gilead and you will be successful; Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.\"\n13 So the messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him: \"Look! The words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. Let your word, please, become like their words, and speak favorably.\" 14 But Micaiah said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, whatever Jehovah says to me is what I will speak.\" 15 Then he came in to the king, and the king asked him: \"Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?\" At once he replied: \"Go up and you will be successful; Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.\" 16 At that the king said to him: \"How many times must I put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of Jehovah?\" 17 So he said: \"I see all the Israelites scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. Jehovah said: 'These have no master. Let each one go back to his house in peace.'\"\n18 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: \"Did I not tell you, 'He will not prophesy good things concerning me, only bad'?\"\n19 Micaiah then said: \"Therefore, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing by him, to his right and to his left. 20 Jehovah then said, 'Who will fool Ahab, so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one was saying one thing while another said something else. 21 Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah and said, 'I will fool him.' Jehovah asked him, 'How will you do it?' 22 He replied, 'I will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' So he said, 'You will fool him, and what is more, you will be successful. Go out and do that.' 23 And now Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, but Jehovah has declared calamity for you.\"\n24 Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah now approached and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said: \"Which way did the spirit of Jehovah pass from me to speak with you?\" 25 Micaiah replied: \"Look! You will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide.\" 26 Then the king of Israel said: \"Take Micaiah and turn him over to Amon the chief of the city and to Joash the king's son. 27 Tell them, 'This is what the king says: \"Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until I return in peace.\"'\" 28 But Micaiah said: \"If you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken with me.\" Then he added: \"Take note, all you peoples.\"\n29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 30 The king of Israel now said to Jehoshaphat: \"I will disguise myself and will go into the battle, but you should put on your royal attire.\" So the king of Israel disguised himself and entered the battle. 31 Now the king of Syria had ordered his 32 chariot commanders: \"Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.\" 32 And as soon as the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said to themselves: \"Surely it is the king of Israel.\" So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat began to cry for help. 33 When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they immediately turned back from following him.\n34 But one man shot his bow at random, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail. So the king said to his charioteer: \"Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I have been badly wounded.\" 35 The fighting raged throughout that day, and the king had to be propped up in the chariot, facing the Syrians. The blood of the wound poured out into the interior of the war chariot, and he died in the evening. 36 Around sunset a cry passed through the camp, saying: \"Everyone to his city! Everyone to his land!\" 37 Thus the king died, and he was brought to Samaria; they buried the king in Samaria. 38 When they washed off the war chariot by the pool of Samaria, the dogs licked up his blood and the prostitutes bathed there, according to the word that Jehovah had spoken.\n39 As for the rest of the history of Ahab, all that he did and the house of ivory that he built and all the cities that he built, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 40 Then Ahab was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.\n41 Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab of Israel. 42 Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 43 He kept walking in all the way of Asa his father. He did not deviate from it, and he did what was right in Jehovah's eyes. However, the high places were not removed, and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places. 44 Jehoshaphat kept peaceful relations with the king of Israel. 45 As for the rest of the history of Jehoshaphat, his mighty exploits and how he waged war, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 46 He also cleared out of the land the rest of the male temple prostitutes who had been left over in the days of Asa his father.\n47 Then there was no king in Edom; a deputy was acting as king.\n48 Jehoshaphat also made Tarshish ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go because the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. 49 It was then that Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat: \"Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,\" but Jehoshaphat did not consent.\n50 Then Jehoshaphat was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David his forefather; and his son Jehoram became king in his place.\n51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the 17th year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years. 52 And he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes and walking in the way of his father and his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. 53 He continued serving Baal and bowing down to him and kept offending Jehovah the God of Israel, just as his father had done. \n",

    "text": "Second Kings\nChapter 1\n1 After the death of Ahab, Moab revolted against Israel.\n2 It was then that Ahaziah fell down through the grating in his roof chamber in Samaria and was injured. So he sent messengers and said to them: \"Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron to find out whether I will recover from this injury.\" 3 But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite: \"Rise up, go to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? 4 Therefore this is what Jehovah says: \"You will not leave the bed on which you are lying, for you will certainly die.\"'\" With that Elijah went off.\n5 When the messengers returned to him, he immediately said to them: \"Why have you come back?\" 6 They replied to him: \"There was a man who came up to meet us, and he said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you and tell him, \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Therefore, you will not leave the bed on which you are lying, for you will certainly die.'\"'\" 7 At this he asked them: \"What did the man look like who came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?\" 8 So they said to him: \"He was a man with a garment of hair and a leather belt around his waist.\" Immediately he said: \"It was Elijah the Tishbite.\"\n9 The king then sent to him a chief of 50 with his 50 men. When he went up to him, he was sitting on the top of the mountain. He said to him: \"Man of the true God, the king says, 'Come down.'\" 10 But Elijah answered the chief of the 50: \"Well, if I am a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men.\" And fire came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men.\n11 So the king sent again to him another chief of 50 with his 50 men. He went and said to him: \"Man of the true God, this is what the king says, 'Come down quickly.'\" 12 But Elijah answered them: \"If I am a man of the true God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your 50 men.\" And fire of God came down from the heavens and consumed him and his 50 men.\n13 Then the king sent again a third chief of 50 and his 50 men. But the third chief of 50 went up and bowed down on his knees in front of Elijah and began to beg for favor and say to him: \"Man of the true God, please, let my life and the lives of these 50 servants of yours be precious in your eyes. 14 Fire has already come down from the heavens and consumed the two former chiefs of 50 and their groups of 50, but now let my life be precious in your eyes.\"\n15 At that the angel of Jehovah told Elijah: \"Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.\" So he rose and went down with him to the king. 16 Elijah then said to the king, \"This is what Jehovah says: 'You sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron. Is it because there is no God in Israel? Why did you not inquire of his word? Therefore, you will not leave the bed on which you are lying, for you will certainly die.'\" 17 So he died, according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah had spoken; and because he did not have a son, Jehoram became king in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah.\n18 As for the rest of the history of Ahaziah, what he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel?\nChapter 2\n1 When Jehovah was about to take Elijah up to the heavens in a windstorm, Elijah and Elisha went out from Gilgal. 2 Elijah said to Elisha: \"Stay here, please, because Jehovah has sent me on to Bethel.\" But Elisha said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living, I will not leave you.\" So they went down to Bethel. 3 Then the sons of the prophets in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him: \"Do you know that today Jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you?\" At this he said: \"I already know it. Be silent.\"\n4 Elijah now said to him: \"Elisha, stay here, please, because Jehovah has sent me on to Jericho.\" But he said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living, I will not leave you.\" So they came to Jericho. 5 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him: \"Do you know that today Jehovah is taking your master away from headship over you?\" At this he said: \"I already know it. Be silent.\"\n6 Elijah now said to him: \"Stay here, please, because Jehovah has sent me on to the Jordan.\" But he said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living, I will not leave you.\" So both of them went on. 7 And 50 of the sons of the prophets also went and stood watching from a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 8 Then Elijah took his official garment and rolled it up and struck the waters, and they were divided to the left and to the right, so that both of them went across on the dry ground.\n9 As soon as they had gone across, Elijah said to Elisha: \"Ask what you want me to do for you before I am taken from you.\" So Elisha said: \"Please, may I receive a double portion of your spirit?\" 10 He replied: \"You have asked a difficult thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will happen for you that way; but if you do not, it will not happen.\"\n11 As they were walking along, speaking as they walked, suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses made a separation between the two of them, and Elijah ascended to the heavens in the windstorm. 12 While Elisha was watching, he was crying out: \"My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and his horsemen!\" When he could no longer see him, he took hold of his own garments and ripped them into two pieces. 13 After that he picked up the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. 14 Then he took the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him and struck the waters and said: \"Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?\" When he struck the waters, they were divided to the left and to the right, so that Elisha went across.\n15 When the sons of the prophets at Jericho saw him from a distance, they said: \"The spirit of Elijah has settled down on Elisha.\" So they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him. 16 They said to him: \"Here are 50 capable men with your servants. Let them go, please, to look for your master. Perhaps the spirit of Jehovah has lifted him up and then thrown him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.\" But he said: \"Do not send them.\" 17 However, they kept urging him until he was embarrassed, so he said: \"Send them.\" They sent the 50 men, who kept looking for three days but did not find him. 18 When they returned to him, he was staying in Jericho. Then he said to them: \"Did I not tell you not to go?\"\n19 In time the men of the city said to Elisha: \"My master can see that the city is well-situated; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.\" 20 At that he said: \"Bring me a small new bowl and put salt in it.\" So they brought it to him. 21 Then he went out to the source of the water and threw salt into it and said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'I have healed this water. No more will it cause death or barrenness.'\" 22 And the water has been healed down to this day, according to the word spoken by Elisha.\n23 He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going along the way, some young boys came out from the city and began to jeer at him, and they kept saying to him: \"Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!\" 24 Finally he turned around and looked at them and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. Then two she-bears came out of the forest and tore 42 of the children to pieces. 25 He kept going from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.\nChapter 3\n1 Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the 18th year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, and he reigned for 12 years. 2 He kept doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, but not to the extent of his father or his mother, for he removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made. 3 However, he clung to the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. He did not depart from them.\n4 Now Mesha the king of Moab was a sheep raiser, and he used to pay 100,000 lambs and 100,000 unshorn rams as tribute to the king of Israel. 5 As soon as Ahab died, the king of Moab revolted against the king of Israel. 6 So King Jehoram went out on that day from Samaria and mustered all Israel. 7 He also sent a message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, saying: \"The king of Moab has revolted against me. Will you go with me to war against Moab?\" To this he said: \"I will go. I am the same as you. My people are the same as your people. My horses are the same as your horses.\" 8 Then he asked: \"By which way should we go up?\" He replied: \"By the way of the wilderness of Edom.\"\n9 The king of Israel then set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After they journeyed roundabout for seven days, there was no water for the camp and for the domestic animals that were following behind them. 10 The king of Israel said: \"How terrible! Jehovah has called these three kings, only to give them into the hand of Moab!\" 11 At that Jehoshaphat said: \"Is there no prophet of Jehovah here through whom we may inquire of Jehovah?\" So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered: \"There is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who used to pour out water on the hands of Elijah.\" 12 Then Jehoshaphat said: \"The word of Jehovah is with him.\" So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.\n13 Elisha said to the king of Israel: \"What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.\" But the king of Israel said to him: \"No, for it is Jehovah who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.\" 14 To this Elisha said: \"As surely as Jehovah of armies whom I serve is living, if I did not have regard for King Jehoshaphat of Judah, I would not look at you or take notice of you. 15 Now bring me a harpist.\" As soon as the harpist started playing, the hand of Jehovah came on him. 16 He said, \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Dig trench after trench in this valley, 17 for this is what Jehovah says: \"You will not see wind, and you will not see rain; yet this valley will be filled with water, and you will drink from it, you, your livestock, and your other animals.\"' 18 But this is a trivial thing in the eyes of Jehovah, for he will also give Moab into your hand. 19 You must strike down every fortified city and every choice city, you should cut down every good tree, you should stop up all the springs of water, and you should ruin every good plot of land with stones.\"\n20 And in the morning, at the time of the morning grain offering, water was suddenly coming from the direction of Edom, and the land became filled with the water.\n21 All the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, so they called together all the men who could bear arms, and they stationed themselves at the border. 22 When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and to the Moabites on the opposite side, the water looked red like blood. 23 They said: \"This is blood! The kings have surely slaughtered one another with the sword. So, then, to the spoil, O Moab!\" 24 When they came into the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and began striking down the Moabites, who fled from them. They advanced into Moab, striking the Moabites down as they went. 25 They tore down the cities, and each man threw a stone into every good plot of land, filling it with stones; they stopped up every spring of water, and they cut down every good tree. Finally only the stone walls of Kir-hareseth remained standing, and the slingers surrounded it and struck it down.\n26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was lost, he took with him 700 men armed with swords to break through to the king of Edom; but they were not able to. 27 So he took his firstborn son who was going to reign in his place and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice on the wall. And there came to be great indignation against Israel, so they withdrew from against him and returned to their land.\nChapter 4\n1 Now one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying: \"Your servant my husband is dead, and you well know that your servant had always feared Jehovah. Now a creditor has come to take both of my children as his slaves.\" 2 At this Elisha said to her: \"What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?\" She replied: \"Your servant has nothing at all in the house but a jar of oil.\" 3 Then he said: \"Go outside, ask for containers from all your neighbors, empty containers. Do not limit yourself to a few. 4 Then go in and close the door behind you and your sons. Fill all these containers, and set the full ones aside.\" 5 So she left him.\nWhen she closed the door behind her and her sons, they passed the containers to her, and she kept pouring. 6 When the containers were full, she said to one of her sons: \"Bring another container to me.\" But he said to her: \"There are no more containers.\" At that the oil stopped. 7 So she came in and told the man of the true God, and he said: \"Go, sell the oil and pay off your debts, and you and your sons can live from what is left.\"\n8 One day Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman, and she urged him to eat a meal there. As often as he would pass by, he would stop there to eat. 9 So she said to her husband: \"I know that it is a holy man of God who comes this way regularly. 10 Please, let us make a small room on the roof and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lampstand. Then, whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.\"\n11 One day he came there, and he went to the room on the roof to lie down. 12 He then said to Gehazi his attendant: \"Call this Shunammite woman.\" So he called her, and she stood before him. 13 Then he said to Gehazi: \"Please tell her, 'Here you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can be done for you? Should I speak in your behalf to the king or to the chief of the army?'\" But her reply was: \"I am living among my own people.\" 14 So he said: \"Then what can be done for her?\" Gehazi now said: \"Well, she does not have a son, and her husband is old.\" 15 Immediately he said: \"Call her.\" So he called her, and she stood at the doorway. 16 Then he said: \"At this time next year, you will be embracing a son.\" But she said: \"No, my master, man of the true God! Do not tell lies to your servant.\"\n17 However, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son at the same time the next year, just as Elisha had told her. 18 The child grew up, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers. 19 He kept saying to his father: \"My head, O my head!\" Then his father said to the attendant: \"Carry him to his mother.\" 20 So he carried him back to his mother, and he sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. 21 Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of the true God, and she shut the door behind her and left. 22 She now called her husband and said: \"Send me, please, one of the attendants and one of the donkeys, and let me go quickly to the man of the true God and return.\" 23 But he said: \"Why are you going to see him today? It is not a new moon or a sabbath.\" However, she said: \"Everything is all right.\" 24 So she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant: \"Go quickly. Do not slow down for me unless I tell you to.\"\n25 So she went to the man of the true God at Mount Carmel. As soon as the man of the true God saw her from afar, he said to Gehazi his attendant: \"Look! The Shunammite woman is over there. 26 Please run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you well? Is your husband well? Is your child well?'\" To this she said: \"All is well.\" 27 When she came to the man of the true God at the mountain, she at once grabbed hold of his feet. At this Gehazi came near to push her away, but the man of the true God said: \"Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress, and Jehovah has hidden it from me and has not told me.\" 28 She then said: \"Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, 'You must not give me a false hope'?\"\n29 He immediately said to Gehazi: \"Wrap your garments around your waist and take my staff in your hand and go. If you encounter anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone should greet you, do not answer him. Go and place my staff on the boy's face.\" 30 At this the boy's mother said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living and as you yourself are living, I will not leave you.\" So he got up and went with her. 31 Gehazi went before them and put the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. He went back to meet Elisha and told him: \"The boy did not wake up.\"\n32 When Elisha came into the house, the boy was lying dead on his bed. 33 He went in and closed the door behind them both and began to pray to Jehovah. 34 Then he got up on the bed and lay down on the child and put his own mouth on the boy's mouth, his own eyes on his eyes, and his own palms on his palms and kept bent over him, and the child's body started to grow warm. 35 He walked back and forth in the house, and he got up on the bed and bent over him again. The boy sneezed seven times, after which he opened his eyes. 36 Elisha now called Gehazi and said: \"Call the Shunammite woman.\" So he called her and she came in to him. Then he said: \"Pick up your son.\" 37 And she came in and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground before him, after which she picked up her son and went out.\n38 When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him, and he said to his attendant: \"Put the large pot on and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.\" 39 So one of them went out to the field to pick mallows, and he found a wild vine and picked wild gourds from it, filling his garment. He then returned and sliced them into the stewpot, not knowing what they were. 40 They later served it to the men to eat, but as soon as they ate from the stew, they cried out: \"There is death in the pot, O man of the true God.\" And they could not eat it. 41 So he said: \"Bring some flour.\" After he threw it into the pot, he said: \"Serve it to the people.\" And nothing harmful was in the pot.\n42 A man came from Baal-shalishah, and he brought the man of the true God 20 loaves of barley bread made from the first ripe fruits, as well as a bag of new grain. Then Elisha said: \"Give it to the people so that they may eat.\" 43 However, his attendant said: \"How can I set this before 100 men?\" To this he said: \"Give it to the people so that they may eat, for this is what Jehovah says, 'They will eat and have some left over.'\" 44 At that he put it before them, and they ate and they had some left over, according to the word of Jehovah.\nChapter 5\n1 Now Naaman the army chief of the king of Syria was a prominent man who was held in esteem by his lord, because through him Jehovah had given victory to Syria. He was a mighty warrior, although he was a leper. 2 On one of their raids, the Syrians had taken captive from the land of Israel a little girl who became a servant to Naaman's wife. 3 She said to her mistress: \"If only my lord would visit the prophet in Samaria! Then he would cure him of his leprosy.\" 4 So he went and reported to his lord, telling him what the girl from Israel had said.\n5 Then the king of Syria said: \"Go now! And I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\" So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of garments. 6 He brought to the king of Israel the letter, which read: \"Along with this letter that has come to you, I send my servant Naaman so that you may cure him of his leprosy.\" 7 As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he ripped his garments apart and said: \"Am I God, to put to death and to keep alive? For he is sending this man to me, telling me to cure him of his leprosy! You can see for yourselves that he is seeking a quarrel with me.\"\n8 But when Elisha the man of the true God heard that the king of Israel had ripped his garments apart, he at once sent word to the king: \"Why did you rip your garments apart? Please let him come to me so that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.\" 9 So Naaman came with his horses and his war chariots and stood at the entrance of the house of Elisha. 10 However, Elisha sent a messenger to tell him: \"Go, wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.\" 11 At this Naaman became indignant and started to leave, saying: \"Here I said to myself, 'He will come out to me and stand here and call on the name of Jehovah his God, moving his hand back and forth over the leprosy to cure it.' 12 Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Can I not wash in them and become clean?\" With that he turned and went away in a rage.\n13 His servants now approached him and said: \"My father, if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary, would you not do it? How much more, then, since he only said to you, 'Wash and be clean'?\" 14 At that he went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of the true God. Then his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy, and he became clean.\n15 After that he went back to the man of the true God, he and all his entourage, and he stood before him and said: \"Now I know that there is no God anywhere in all the earth but in Israel. Now accept, please, a gift from your servant.\" 16 However, Elisha said: \"As surely as Jehovah whom I serve is living, I will not accept it.\" He urged him to accept it, but he kept refusing. 17 Finally Naaman said: \"If not, please, let your servant be given two mule-loads of soil from this land, for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any gods other than Jehovah. 18 But may Jehovah forgive your servant for this one thing: When my lord goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, he supports himself on my arm, so I have to bow down at the house of Rimmon. When I bow down at the house of Rimmon, may Jehovah, please, forgive your servant for this.\" 19 At this he said to him: \"Go in peace.\" After he departed from him and had traveled for some distance, 20 Gehazi the attendant of Elisha the man of the true God said to himself: 'Here my master has spared this Syrian Naaman by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as Jehovah is living, I will run after him and take something from him.' 21 So Gehazi chased after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him and said: \"Is everything all right?\" 22 To this he said: \"All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Look! Just now two young men from the mountainous region of Ephraim from the sons of the prophets came to me. Give them, please, a talent of silver and two changes of garments.'\" 23 Naaman said: \"Go on, take two talents.\" He kept urging him, and he wrapped up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and gave them to two of his attendants, who carried them before him.\n24 When he reached Ophel, he took them from their hand and put them in the house and sent the men away. After they left, 25 he went in and stood by his master. Elisha now said to him: \"Where did you come from, Gehazi?\" But he said: \"Your servant did not go anywhere.\" 26 Elisha said to him: \"Was my heart not there with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to accept silver or to accept garments or olive groves or vineyards or sheep or cattle or male or female servants? 27 Now Naaman's leprosy will stick to you and your descendants forever.\" Immediately he went out from before him a leper, white as snow.\nChapter 6\n1 The sons of the prophets said to Elisha: \"Look! The place where we are staying with you is too cramped for us. 2 Please let us go to the Jordan. Let each of us take a log from there and make a place there where we can dwell.\" He said: \"Go.\" 3 One of them said: \"Will you please come along with your servants?\" At that he said: \"I will come.\" 4 So he went with them, and they came to the Jordan and began to cut down the trees. 5 As one of them was cutting down a tree, the axhead fell into the water, and he cried out: \"Alas, my master, it was borrowed!\" 6 The man of the true God said: \"Where did it fall?\" So he showed him the place. He then cut off a piece of wood and threw it there and made the axhead float. 7 He said: \"Lift it out.\" So he reached out his hand and took it.\n8 Now the king of Syria went to war against Israel. He consulted with his servants and said: \"I will encamp at such and such a place with you.\" 9 Then the man of the true God sent word to the king of Israel, saying: \"Beware of passing by this place, because that is where the Syrians are coming down.\" 10 So the king of Israel sent word to the place that the man of the true God had warned him about. He kept warning him, and he stayed away from there on several occasions.\n11 This enraged the king of Syria, so he summoned his servants and said to them: \"Tell me! Who among us is on the side of the king of Israel?\" 12 Then one of his servants said: \"None of us, my lord the king! It is Elisha the prophet in Israel who tells the king of Israel the things that you say in your own bedroom.\" 13 He said: \"Go and find out where he is, so that I may send men to capture him.\" Later the report was made to him: \"He is in Dothan.\" 14 He immediately sent horses and war chariots there, as well as a large army; they came by night and surrounded the city.\n15 When the attendant of the man of the true God rose early and went outside, he saw that an army with horses and war chariots was surrounding the city. At once the attendant said to him: \"Alas, my master! What are we to do?\" 16 But he said: \"Do not be afraid! For there are more who are with us than those who are with them.\" 17 Then Elisha began to pray and say: \"O Jehovah, open his eyes, please, that he may see.\" Immediately Jehovah opened the attendant's eyes and he saw, and look! the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire all around Elisha.\n18 When the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah and said: \"Please, strike this nation with blindness.\" So he struck them with blindness, just as Elisha had requested. 19 Elisha now said to them: \"This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and let me lead you to the man you are looking for.\" However, he led them to Samaria.\n20 When they arrived in Samaria, Elisha said: \"O Jehovah, open their eyes so that they may see.\" So Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria. 21 When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha: \"Should I strike them down, should I strike them down, my father?\" 22 But he said: \"You must not strike them down. Do you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Give them bread and water so they may eat and drink and return to their lord.\" 23 So he spread a great feast for them, and they ate and drank, after which he sent them away to return to their lord. And not once did the marauder bands of the Syrians come again into the land of Israel.\n24 Afterward Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together and went up and besieged Samaria. 25 So there was a great famine in Samaria, and they besieged it until a donkey's head was worth 80 silver pieces, and a fourth of a cab measure of dove's droppings was worth 5 silver pieces. 26 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him: \"Help us, O my lord the king!\" 27 To this he said: \"If Jehovah does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? Or from the wine or oil press?\" 28 The king asked her: \"What is the matter with you?\" She replied: \"This woman said to me, 'Hand over your son, and we will eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.' 29 So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Hand over your son so that we may eat him.' But she hid her son.\"\n30 As soon as the king heard the woman's words, he ripped his garments apart. When he passed by on the wall, the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes. 31 Then he said: \"So may God do to me and add to it if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!\"\n32 Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders: \"Have you seen how this son of a murderer has sent to take off my head? Watch when the messenger comes, close the door, and hold the door shut against him. Is not the sound of his lord's footsteps behind him?\" 33 While he was still speaking with them, the messenger came to him, and the king said: \"This calamity is from Jehovah. Why should I wait any longer for Jehovah?\"\nChapter 7\n1 Elisha now said, \"Listen to the word of Jehovah. This is what Jehovah says: 'Tomorrow about this time at the gate of Samaria, a seah measure of fine flour will be worth a shekel, and two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel.'\" 2 At that the adjutant whom the king relied on said to the man of the true God: \"Even if Jehovah should open floodgates in the heavens, could this possibly take place?\" To that he said: \"You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat from it.\"\n3 There were four lepers at the entrance of the city gate, and they said to one another: \"Why are we sitting here until we die? 4 If we say, 'Let us go into the city,' while the famine is in the city, we would die there. And if we sit here, we will die anyway. So now let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives, we will live, but if they put us to death, then we will die.\" 5 They then got up in the evening darkness and entered the camp of the Syrians. When they reached the outskirts of the Syrian camp, there was nobody there.\n6 For Jehovah had caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of war chariots and horses, the sound of a huge army. So they said to one another: \"Look! The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us!\" 7 They immediately got up and fled in the evening darkness, leaving their tents, horses, donkeys, and the whole camp just as it was, and they fled for their lives.\n8 When these lepers reached the outskirts of the camp, they entered into one of the tents and began to eat and drink. They carried away from there silver, gold, and garments and went and hid them. Then they returned and entered another tent and carried things away from there and went and hid them.\n9 Finally they said to one another: \"What we are doing is not right. This day is a day of good news! If we hesitate and wait until dawn, we will deserve to be punished. Let us now go and report this at the king's house.\" 10 So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city and reported to them: \"We went into the camp of the Syrians, but nobody was there-we did not hear anyone at all. There were only the horses and donkeys tied and the tents left just as they were.\" 11 At once the gatekeepers called out, and it was reported inside the king's house.\n12 Immediately the king got up by night and said to his servants: \"Please let me tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry, so they left the camp to hide in the field, saying, 'They will come out of the city, and we will catch them alive and enter into the city.'\" 13 Then one of his servants said: \"Please, let some men take five of the remaining horses that are in the city. Look! They will end up the same as all the crowd of Israel that remain here. Look! They will end up the same as all the crowd of Israel that perished. Let us then send them out and see.\" 14 So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them out to the camp of the Syrians, saying: \"Go and see.\" 15 They followed them as far as the Jordan, and the entire way was covered with garments and utensils that the Syrians had thrown away as they fled in panic. The messengers returned and reported it to the king.\n16 The people then went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians, so that a seah measure of fine flour came to be worth a shekel, and two seah measures of barley came to be worth a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah. 17 The king had appointed the adjutant whom he relied on to be in charge of the gate, but the people trampled him to death at the gate, just as the man of the true God had told the king when he came down to him. 18 It happened just as the man of the true God had said to the king: \"Two seah measures of barley will be worth a shekel, and a seah measure of fine flour will be worth a shekel tomorrow at this time at the gate of Samaria.\" 19 But the adjutant had said to the man of the true God: \"Even if Jehovah should open floodgates in the heavens, could such a thing take place?\" To this Elisha had said: \"You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat from it.\" 20 That is exactly what happened to him, because the people trampled him to death at the gate.\nChapter 8\n1 Elisha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life: \"Rise up and go, you with your household, and live as a foreigner wherever you can, for Jehovah has declared a famine, and it will come on the land for seven years.\" 2 So the woman got up and did what the man of the true God said. She went with her household and settled in the land of the Philistines for seven years.\n3 At the end of seven years, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and her field. 4 Now the king was speaking to Gehazi the attendant of the man of the true God, saying: \"Relate to me, please, all the great things that Elisha has done.\" 5 Just as he was relating to the king how he had restored the dead one to life, the woman whose son he had restored to life came to the king, appealing for her house and her field. At once Gehazi said: \"My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.\" 6 At that the king asked the woman, and she related the story to him. Then the king assigned her a court official, telling him: \"Return all that belongs to her and all the products of the field from the day she left the land until now.\"\n7 Elisha came to Damascus when Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. So the report was made to him: \"The man of the true God has come here.\" 8 At that the king said to Hazael: \"Take a gift with you and go and meet the man of the true God. Inquire of Jehovah through him, asking, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'\" 9 Hazael went to meet him and took a gift with him, every sort of good thing of Damascus, the load of 40 camels. He came and stood before him and said: \"Your son, Ben-hadad the king of Syria, has sent me to you, asking, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'\" 10 Elisha replied to him: \"Go and tell him, 'You will certainly recover,' but Jehovah has shown me that he will certainly die.\" 11 And he kept staring at him to the point of embarrassment. Then the man of the true God gave way to weeping. 12 Hazael asked: \"Why is my lord weeping?\" He replied: \"Because I know what harm you will do to the people of Israel. Their fortified places you will set on fire, their choice men you will kill with the sword, their children you will dash to pieces, and their pregnant women you will rip open.\" 13 Hazael said: \"How could your servant, who is a mere dog, do such a deed?\" But Elisha said: \"Jehovah has shown me that you will be king over Syria.\"\n14 Then he left Elisha and returned to his own lord, who said to him: \"What did Elisha say to you?\" He replied: \"He told me that you will certainly recover.\" 15 But the next day, Hazael took a coverlet, dipped it in water, and held it over his face until he died. And Hazael became king in his place.\n16 In the fifth year of Jehoram the son of Ahab the king of Israel, while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram the son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah became king. 17 He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. 18 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as those of the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab's daughter had become his wife; and he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. 19 But Jehovah did not want to bring Judah to ruin for the sake of David his servant, since he had promised him to give a lamp to him and to his sons always.\n20 In his days Edom revolted against Judah and then set up its own king. 21 So Jehoram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots, and he rose up by night and defeated the Edomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders; and the troops fled to their tents. 22 But Edom has kept up its revolt against Judah to this day. Libnah also revolted at that time.\n23 And the rest of the history of Jehoram, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 24 Then Jehoram was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David. And his son Ahaziah became king in his place.\n25 In the 12th year of Jehoram the son of Ahab the king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of King Jehoram of Judah became king. 26 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah the granddaughter of King Omri of Israel. 27 He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and kept doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, like the house of Ahab, for he was related to the house of Ahab by marriage. 28 So he went with Jehoram the son of Ahab to wage war against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, but the Syrians wounded Jehoram. 29 So King Jehoram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram the son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.\nChapter 9\n1 Elisha the prophet then called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him: \"Wrap your garments around your waist, and quickly take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth-gilead. 2 When you arrive there, look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi; go in and have him get up from among his brothers and take him into the innermost room. 3 Then take the flask of oil and pour it out on his head and say, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"I anoint you as king over Israel.\"' Then open the door and flee without delay.\"\n4 So the prophet's attendant got on his way to Ramoth-gilead. 5 When he arrived, the army chiefs were seated there. He said: \"I have a message for you, O chief.\" Jehu asked: \"For which one of us?\" He said: \"For you, O chief.\" 6 So Jehu got up and went into the house; the attendant poured the oil out on his head and said to him, \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'I anoint you as king over Jehovah's people, over Israel. 7 You must strike down the house of Ahab your lord, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of Jehovah who died at the hands of Jezebel. 8 And the whole house of Ahab will perish; and I will annihilate from Ahab every male, including the helpless and weak in Israel. 9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. 10 As for Jezebel, the dogs will eat her up in the plot of land at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'\" With that he opened the door and fled.\n11 When Jehu went back to the servants of his lord, they asked him: \"Is everything all right? Why did this crazy man come to you?\" He answered them: \"You know that sort of man and his sort of talk.\" 12 But they said: \"That is not true! Tell us, please.\" Then he said: \"This is what he said to me, and then he added, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"I anoint you as king over Israel.\"'\" 13 At this each of them quickly took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the horn and said: \"Jehu has become king!\" 14 Then Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Jehoram.\nJehoram had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead, he with all Israel, because of King Hazael of Syria. 15 King Jehoram later returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Syrians inflicted on him when he fought King Hazael of Syria.\nJehu now said: \"If you agree, do not let anyone escape from the city to go and report this in Jezreel.\" 16 Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Jehoram was lying there wounded, and King Ahaziah of Judah had gone down to see Jehoram. 17 As the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, he saw the throng of Jehu's men approaching. At once he said: \"I see a throng of men.\" Jehoram said: \"Take a cavalryman and send him to meet them, and let him say, 'Are you coming in peace?'\" 18 So a horseman went to meet him and said: \"This is what the king says, 'Are you coming in peace?'\" But Jehu said: \"What do you have to do with 'peace'? Fall in behind me!\"\nThe watchman then reported: \"The messenger reached them, but he has not returned.\" 19 So he sent out a second horseman, who said when he came to them: \"This is what the king says, 'Are you coming in peace?'\" But Jehu said: \"What do you have to do with 'peace'? Fall in behind me!\"\n20 The watchman then reported: \"He reached them, but he has not returned, and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the grandson of Nimshi, for he drives like a madman.\" 21 Jehoram said: \"Hitch up!\" So his war chariot was hitched up and King Jehoram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in his own war chariot to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the plot of land of Naboth the Jezreelite.\n22 As soon as Jehoram saw Jehu, he said: \"Are you coming in peace, Jehu?\" But he said: \"What peace could there be as long as there is the prostitution of Jezebel your mother and her many sorceries?\" 23 At once Jehoram turned his chariot to flee, and he said to Ahaziah: \"We have been tricked, Ahaziah!\" 24 Jehu took his bow in hand and shot Jehoram between the shoulders, and the arrow came out at his heart, and he collapsed in his war chariot. 25 He then said to Bidkar his adjutant: \"Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember, you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father when Jehovah himself made this pronouncement against him: 26 '\"As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday,\" declares Jehovah, \"I will repay you in this very plot of land,\" declares Jehovah.' So now pick him up and throw him into the plot of land, according to the word of Jehovah.\"\n27 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what was happening, he fled by way of the garden house. (Later Jehu pursued him and said: \"Strike him down also!\" So they struck him down in the chariot on his way up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. But he continued his flight to Megiddo and died there. 28 Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his grave with his forefathers in the City of David. 29 It was in the 11th year of Jehoram the son of Ahab that Ahaziah had become king over Judah.)\n30 When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. So she painted her eyes with black paint and adorned her head and looked down through the window. 31 As Jehu came in through the gate, she said: \"Did it go well with Zimri, the killer of his lord?\" 32 Looking up to the window, he said: \"Who is on my side? Who?\" Immediately two or three court officials looked down at him. 33 He said: \"Throw her down!\" So they threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her. 34 After that he went in and ate and drank. He then said: \"Please, take care of this accursed woman and bury her. After all, she is the daughter of a king.\" 35 But when they went to bury her, they did not find anything but her skull and her feet and the palms of her hands. 36 When they returned and told him, he said: \"This fulfills the word of Jehovah that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'In the plot of land of Jezreel, the dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel. 37 And the dead body of Jezebel will become as manure on the surface of the field in the plot of land of Jezreel, so that they may not say: \"This is Jezebel.\"'\"\nChapter 10\n1 Now Ahab had 70 sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the princes of Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's children, saying: 2 \"Now when this letter comes to you, the sons of your lord will be with you, as well as the war chariots, the horses, a fortified city, and weapons. 3 Select the best and most suitable of the sons of your lord and put him on the throne of his father. Then fight for the house of your lord.\"\n4 But they were overcome with fear and said: \"Look! If two kings could not stand before him, how can we stand?\" 5 So the overseer of the palace, the governor of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: \"We are your servants, and we will do everything that you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever seems good in your eyes.\"\n6 Then he wrote them a second letter, saying: \"If you belong to me and are willing to obey me, bring the heads of the sons of your lord and come to me tomorrow at this time at Jezreel.\"\nNow the 70 sons of the king were with the distinguished men of the city who were raising them. 7 As soon as the letter came to them, they took the sons of the king and slaughtered them, 70 men, and they put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel. 8 The messenger came in and told him: \"They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.\" So he said: \"Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning.\" 9 When he went out in the morning, he stood before all the people and said: \"You are innocent. Yes, I conspired against my lord, and I killed him, but who struck down all of these? 10 Know, then, that not a single word of Jehovah's that Jehovah has spoken against the house of Ahab will go unfulfilled, and Jehovah has done what he spoke through his servant Elijah.\" 11 Moreover, Jehu struck down all who were left of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, as well as all his distinguished men, his acquaintances, and his priests, until he had left him no survivor.\n12 Then he got up and went on his way to Samaria. The binding house of the shepherds was on the way. 13 There Jehu encountered the brothers of King Ahaziah of Judah, and he said to them, \"Who are you?\" They said: \"We are the brothers of Ahaziah, and we are on our way down to ask if all is well with the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.\" 14 Immediately he said: \"Capture them alive!\" So they captured them alive and slaughtered them at the cistern of the binding house, 42 men. He did not let a single one of them survive.\n15 As he went from there, he encountered Jehonadab the son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. When he greeted him, he said to him: \"Is your heart fully with me, just as my heart is with your heart?\"\nJehonadab replied: \"It is.\"\n\"If so, give me your hand.\"\nSo he gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot with him. 16 Then he said: \"Come along with me, and see my toleration of no rivalry toward Jehovah.\" So they had him ride with him in his war chariot. 17 Then he came to Samaria, and he struck down all who were left over of Ahab's house in Samaria until he had annihilated them, according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken to Elijah.\n18 Further, Jehu collected all the people together and said to them: \"Ahab worshipped Baal a little, but Jehu will worship him much more. 19 So summon all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests to me. Do not let a single one be absent, because I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who is absent will not live.\" But Jehu was acting with cunning to destroy the worshippers of Baal.\n20 Jehu continued: \"Declare a solemn assembly for Baal.\" So they proclaimed it. 21 After that Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came. Not a single one was left out who did not come. They entered the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from end to end. 22 He said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe: \"Bring out garments for all the worshippers of Baal.\" So he brought out the clothing for them. 23 Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the house of Baal. He now said to the worshippers of Baal: \"Search carefully and see that there are no worshippers of Jehovah here, only worshippers of Baal.\" 24 Finally they came in to offer up sacrifices and burnt offerings. Jehu had stationed 80 of his men outside and said: \"If any one of the men I am putting into your hands escapes, it will be your life for his.\"\n25 As soon as he finished offering up the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and the adjutants: \"Come in and strike them down! Do not let a single one escape!\" So the guards and the adjutants struck them down with the sword and threw them out, and they kept going as far as the inner sanctuary of the house of Baal. 26 Then they brought out the sacred pillars of the house of Baal and burned each one. 27 They tore down the sacred pillar of Baal, and they tore down the house of Baal and turned it into latrines, as it remains to this day.\n28 Thus Jehu annihilated Baal out of Israel. 29 However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit as regards the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan. 30 So Jehovah said to Jehu: \"Because you have acted well and have done what is right in my eyes by carrying out all that was in my heart to do to the house of Ahab, four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.\" 31 But Jehu did not take care to walk in the Law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.\n32 In those days Jehovah started to cut off Israel piece by piece. Hazael kept attacking them throughout the territory of Israel, 33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead-of the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites-from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, to Gilead and Bashan.\n34 And the rest of the history of Jehu, all that he did and all his mightiness, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 35 Then Jehu was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and his son Jehoahaz became king in his place. 36 The length of Jehu's reign over Israel was 28 years in Samaria.\nChapter 11\n1 Now when Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son had died, she rose up and destroyed the entire royal line. 2 However, Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, Ahaziah's sister, took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were to be put to death, keeping him and his nurse in an inner bedroom. They managed to keep him concealed from Athaliah, so he was not put to death. 3 He remained with her for six years, hidden at the house of Jehovah, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.\n4 In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the chiefs of hundreds of the Carian bodyguard and of the palace guards and had them come to him at the house of Jehovah. He made a pact with them and had them swear to it at the house of Jehovah, and then he showed them the son of the king. 5 He ordered them: \"This is what you are to do: One third of you will be on duty on the Sabbath and will keep strict watch over the king's house, 6 another third will be at the Gate of the Foundation, and another third will be at the gate behind the palace guards. You will take turns watching over the house. 7 Your two divisions that are supposed to be off duty on the Sabbath must keep strict watch over the house of Jehovah to protect the king. 8 You must surround the king on every side, each with his weapons in hand. Anyone entering within the ranks will be put to death. Stay with the king wherever he goes.\"\n9 The chiefs of hundreds did exactly what Jehoiada the priest had commanded. So each one took his men who were on duty on the Sabbath, together with those who were off duty on the Sabbath, and they came in to Jehoiada the priest. 10 The priest then gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the circular shields that had belonged to King David, which were in the house of Jehovah. 11 And the palace guards took their positions, each with his weapons in hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, all around the king. 12 Then Jehoiada brought the king's son out and put on him the crown and the Testimony, and they made him king and anointed him. They began to clap their hands and say: \"Long live the king!\"\n13 When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running, she immediately came to the people at the house of Jehovah. 14 Then she saw the king standing there by the pillar according to the custom. The chiefs and the trumpeters were with the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets. At this Athaliah ripped her garments apart and cried out: \"Conspiracy! Conspiracy!\" 15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the chiefs of hundreds, those appointed over the army, and said to them: \"Take her out from among the ranks, and if anyone follows her, put him to death with the sword!\" For the priest had said: \"Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah.\" 16 So they seized her, and when she reached the place where the horses enter the king's house, she was put to death there.\n17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they would continue as the people of Jehovah, and he also made a covenant between the king and the people. 18 After that all the people of the land came to the house of Baal and tore down his altars, completely smashed his images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.\nThen the priest appointed overseers over the house of Jehovah. 19 Further, he took the chiefs of hundreds, the Carian bodyguard, the palace guards, and all the people of the land to escort the king down from the house of Jehovah, and they came to the king's house by the way of the gate of the palace guard. He then sat on the throne of the kings. 20 So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king's house.\n21 Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.\nChapter 12\n1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah from Beer-sheba. 2 Jehoash continued doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 3 However, the high places were not removed, and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places.\n4 Jehoash said to the priests: \"Take all the money that is brought to the house of Jehovah for the holy offerings, the money for which each one is assessed, the money given as an estimated value for a person, and all the money that each person's heart is moved to bring to the house of Jehovah. 5 The priests will personally take it from their donors and use it to repair the house, wherever any damage is found.\"\n6 By the 23rd year of King Jehoash, the priests had not yet repaired the damage to the house. 7 So King Jehoash called Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them: \"Why are you not repairing the damage to the house? Therefore, do not take any more money from your donors unless it is used to repair the house.\" 8 At that the priests agreed not to take any more money from the people and not to be responsible for repairing the house.\n9 Jehoiada the priest then took a chest and bored a hole in its lid and put it next to the altar on the right as one enters the house of Jehovah. That is where the priests who served as doorkeepers would put all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah. 10 Whenever they saw that there was a great deal of money in the chest, the secretary of the king and the high priest would come up and collect and count the money that had been brought to the house of Jehovah. 11 They would give the money that had been counted to those appointed over the work being done in the house of Jehovah. They, in turn, paid it to the woodworkers and to the builders who were working at the house of Jehovah, 12 as well as to the masons and the stonecutters. They also bought timbers and hewn stones for repairing the damage to the house of Jehovah and used the money for all the other expenses incurred in repairing the house.\n13 However, none of the money brought to the house of Jehovah was used to make basins of silver, extinguishers, bowls, trumpets, or any sort of gold or silver article for the house of Jehovah. 14 They would give it only to those who did the work, and with it they repaired the house of Jehovah. 15 They would not call for an accounting from the men to whom they gave the money to give to the workers, for they were trustworthy. 16 However, the money for guilt offerings and the money for sin offerings was not brought to the house of Jehovah; it belonged to the priests.\n17 It was then that Hazael the king of Syria went up to fight against Gath, and he captured it, after which he decided to attack Jerusalem. 18 At that King Jehoash of Judah took all the holy offerings that his forefathers Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah, had sanctified, as well as his own holy offerings and all the gold to be found in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the king's house, and sent them to Hazael the king of Syria. So he withdrew from Jerusalem.\n19 As for the rest of the history of Jehoash, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 20 However, his servants joined in a conspiracy against him and struck Jehoash down at the house of the Mound, on the way that goes down to Silla. 21 His servants Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer were the ones who struck him and put him to death. They buried him with his forefathers in the City of David, and his son Amaziah became king in his place.\nChapter 13\n1 In the 23rd year of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah the king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for 17 years. 2 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, and he persisted in the sin that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. He did not turn away from it. 3 So Jehovah's anger grew hot against Israel, and he gave them into the hand of King Hazael of Syria and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael all their days.\n4 In time Jehoahaz begged for the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah listened to him, for he had seen the oppression the king of Syria had inflicted on Israel. 5 So Jehovah provided Israel with a savior to free them from Syria's grip, and the Israelites were able to dwell in their homes as before. 6 (However, they did not depart from the sin of the house of Jeroboam that he had caused Israel to commit. They continued in this sin, and the sacred pole continued to stand in Samaria.) 7 Jehoahaz was left with an army of only 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers, because the king of Syria had destroyed them, trampling them like the dust at threshing time.\n8 As for the rest of the history of Jehoahaz, all that he did and his mightiness, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 9 Then Jehoahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and his son Jehoash became king in his place.\n10 In the 37th year of King Jehoash of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for 16 years. 11 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, not departing from all the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had made Israel commit. He continued in these sins.\n12 As for the rest of the history of Jehoash, all that he did and his mightiness and how he fought against King Amaziah of Judah, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 13 Then Jehoash was laid to rest with his forefathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.\n14 Now when Elisha became ill with the sickness from which he eventually died, Jehoash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him, saying: \"My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and his horsemen!\" 15 Elisha then said to him: \"Take a bow and arrows.\" So he took a bow and arrows. 16 Then he said to the king of Israel: \"Put your hand to the bow.\" So he put his hand to it, after which Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands. 17 Then he said: \"Open the window toward the east.\" So he opened it. Elisha said: \"Shoot!\" So he shot. He now said: \"Jehovah's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! You will strike down Syria at Aphek until you finish it off.\"\n18 He continued: \"Take the arrows,\" and he took them. Then he said to the king of Israel: \"Strike the ground.\" So he struck the ground three times and stopped. 19 At that the man of the true God grew indignant at him and said: \"You should have struck the ground five or six times! Then you would have struck down Syria until you finished it off, but now you will strike down Syria only three times.\"\n20 After that Elisha died and was buried. There were Moabite marauder bands that would come into the land at the beginning of the year. 21 As some men were burying a man, they saw the marauder band, so they quickly threw the man into Elisha's burial place and ran off. When the man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life and stood on his feet.\n22 Now King Hazael of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 23 However, Jehovah extended favor and mercy to them and showed his concern for them for the sake of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not want to bring them to ruin, and he has not cast them away from his presence to this day. 24 When King Hazael of Syria died, his son Ben-hadad became king in his place. 25 Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz then took back from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities that he had taken in war from Jehoahaz his father. Three times Jehoash struck him down, and he recovered the cities of Israel.\nChapter 14\n1 In the second year of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the king of Israel, Amaziah the son of King Jehoash of Judah became king. 2 He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 3 He continued to do what was right in Jehovah's eyes, but not like David his forefather. He did everything as Jehoash his father had done. 4 However, the high places were not removed, and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places. 5 As soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control, he struck down his servants who had struck down his father the king. 6 But he did not put the sons of the murderers to death, in harmony with Jehovah's commandment written in the book of Moses' Law: \"Fathers should not be put to death for their sons, and sons should not be put to death for their fathers; but each one should be put to death for his own sin.\" 7 He struck down the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, 10,000 men, and captured Sela in the war, and its name became Joktheel to this day.\n8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu the king of Israel, saying: \"Come, let us confront each other in battle.\" 9 King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah: \"The thorny weed in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' However, a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorny weed. 10 True, you have struck down Edom, so your heart has become arrogant. Enjoy your glory, but stay in your own house. Why should you provoke disaster and fall, bringing Judah down with you?\" 11 But Amaziah did not listen.\nSo King Jehoash of Israel went up, and he and King Amaziah of Judah confronted each other in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 12 Judah was defeated by Israel, so each one fled to his home. 13 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then they came to Jerusalem, and he made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 14 He took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the house of the king, as well as hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.\n15 As for the rest of the history of Jehoash, what he did and his mightiness and how he fought against King Amaziah of Judah, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 16 Then Jehoash was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and his son Jeroboam became king in his place.\n17 Amaziah the son of Jehoash the king of Judah lived for 15 years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the king of Israel. 18 As for the rest of the history of Amaziah, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 19 Later a conspiracy was formed against him at Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and put him to death there. 20 So they carried him back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his forefathers in the City of David. 21 Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 22 He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after the king was laid to rest with his forefathers.\n23 In the 15th year of Amaziah the son of Jehoash the king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of King Jehoash of Israel became king in Samaria, and he reigned for 41 years. 24 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. He did not depart from all the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 25 He restored the boundary of Israel from Lebo-hamath clear to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word that Jehovah the God of Israel spoke through his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher. 26 For Jehovah had seen the very bitter affliction of Israel. There was no one left to help Israel, not even the helpless or the weak. 27 But Jehovah had promised not to wipe out the name of Israel from under the heavens. So he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Jehoash.\n28 As for the rest of the history of Jeroboam, all that he did and his mightiness, how he fought and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 29 Then Jeroboam was laid to rest with his forefathers, with the kings of Israel; and his son Zechariah became king in his place.\nChapter 15\n1 In the 27th year of King Jeroboam of Israel, Azariah the son of King Amaziah of Judah became king. 2 He was 16 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 3 He continued to do what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father Amaziah had done. 4 However, the high places were not removed, and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places. 5 Jehovah afflicted the king, and he remained a leper until the day of his death; and he stayed in a separate house, while the king's son Jotham was in charge of the house, judging the people of the land. 6 As for the rest of the history of Azariah, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 7 Then Azariah was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him with his forefathers in the City of David; and his son Jotham became king in his place.\n8 In the 38th year of King Azariah of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for six months. 9 He did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, just as his forefathers had done. He did not depart from the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 10 Then Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and struck him down at Ibleam. After putting him to death, he became king in his place. 11 As for the rest of the history of Zechariah, it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel. 12 That fulfilled Jehovah's word spoken to Jehu: \"Four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.\" And that is how it happened.\n13 Shallum the son of Jabesh became king in the 39th year of King Uzziah of Judah, and he reigned for a full month in Samaria. 14 Then Menahem the son of Gadi came up from Tirzah to Samaria and struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria. After putting him to death, he became king in his place. 15 As for the rest of the history of Shallum and the conspiracy that he formed, it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel. 16 It was then that Menahem came from Tirzah and struck down Tiphsah and all who were in it and its territory, because it did not open its gates to him. He struck it down and ripped open its pregnant women.\n17 In the 39th year of King Azariah of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and he reigned for ten years in Samaria. 18 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. He did not depart from all the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit, all his days. 19 King Pul of Assyria came into the land, and Menahem gave Pul 1,000 talents of silver in return for his support in strengthening his hold on the kingdom. 20 So Menahem raised the silver from Israel by exacting it from the prominent, wealthy men. He gave the king of Assyria 50 silver shekels for each man. Then the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay in the land. 21 As for the rest of the history of Menahem, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? 22 Then Menahem was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Pekahiah became king in his place.\n23 In the 50th year of King Azariah of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for two years. 24 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. He did not depart from the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 25 Then his adjutant Pekah the son of Remaliah conspired against him and struck him down in Samaria in the fortified tower of the king's house with Argob and Arieh. He had 50 men of Gilead with him; and after he put him to death, he became king in his place. 26 As for the rest of the history of Pekahiah, all that he did, it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel.\n27 In the 52nd year of King Azariah of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for 20 years. 28 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, and he did not depart from the sins that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. 29 In the days of King Pekah of Israel, King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria invaded and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and he took the inhabitants into exile in Assyria. 30 Then Hoshea the son of Elah formed a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and he struck him and put him to death; and he became king in his place in the 20th year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 31 As for the rest of the history of Pekah, all that he did, it is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel.\n32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel, Jotham the son of King Uzziah of Judah became king. 33 He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 34 He kept doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father Uzziah had done. 35 However, the high places were not removed, and the people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places. He was the one who built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah. 36 As for the rest of the history of Jotham, what he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 37 In those days Jehovah began sending Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah. 38 Then Jotham was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David his forefather. And his son Ahaz became king in his place.\nChapter 16\n1 In the 17th year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of King Jotham of Judah became king. 2 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God as David his forefather had done. 3 Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and he even made his own son pass through the fire, following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the Israelites. 4 He also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places, on the hills, and under every luxuriant tree.\n5 It was then that King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to wage war against Jerusalem. They laid siege against Ahaz but were not able to capture the city. 6 At that time King Rezin of Syria restored Elath to Edom, after which he drove the Jews out of Elath. And the Edomites entered Elath, and they have occupied it down to this day. 7 So Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, saying: \"I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.\" 8 Ahaz then took the silver and the gold that was to be found at the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the king's house and sent the king of Assyria a bribe. 9 The king of Assyria responded to his request, and he went up to Damascus and captured it and led its people into exile to Kir, and he put Rezin to death.\n10 Then King Ahaz went to meet King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria at Damascus. When he saw the altar that was in Damascus, King Ahaz sent Urijah the priest a plan of the altar, showing its pattern and how it was made. 11 Urijah the priest built an altar according to all the directions that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Urijah the priest finished building it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus. 12 When the king returned from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached the altar and made offerings on it. 13 And on that altar he continued to make his burnt offerings and his grain offerings smoke; he also poured out his drink offerings and sprinkled the blood of his communion sacrifices on it. 14 Then he moved the copper altar that was before Jehovah from its place in front of the house, from between his own altar and the house of Jehovah, and he put it at the north side of his own altar. 15 King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest: \"Make the morning burnt offering smoke on the great altar, also the evening grain offering, the king's burnt offering, and his grain offering, as well as the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the drink offerings of all the people. You should also sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the blood of the other sacrifices. As for the copper altar, let me decide what to do with it.\" 16 And Urijah the priest did everything that King Ahaz had commanded.\n17 Furthermore, King Ahaz cut the side panels of the carriages into pieces and removed the basins from them, and he took the Sea down off the copper bulls that supported it and put it on a stone pavement. 18 And the covered structure for the Sabbath that had been built in the house and the king's outer entryway he shifted away from the house of Jehovah; he did so because of the king of Assyria.\n19 As for the rest of the history of Ahaz, what he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 20 Then Ahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David; and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.\nChapter 17\n1 In the 12th year of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria; he ruled for nine years. 2 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, only not to the extent of the kings of Israel prior to him. 3 King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant and began to pay tribute to him. 4 However, the king of Assyria learned that Hoshea was involved in a conspiracy, for he had sent messengers to King So of Egypt and did not bring the tribute up to the king of Assyria as in former years. Therefore, the king of Assyria kept him confined and bound in prison.\n5 The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, and he came to Samaria and laid siege to it for three years. 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria. He then led the people of Israel into exile in Assyria and made them dwell in Halah and in Habor at the river Gozan and in the cities of the Medes.\n7 This happened because the people of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the control of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshipped other gods, 8 they followed the customs of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the Israelites, and they followed the customs that the kings of Israel had established.\n9 The Israelites were pursuing the things that were not right according to Jehovah their God. They kept building high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city. 10 They kept setting up for themselves sacred pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree; 11 and on all the high places they would make sacrificial smoke just as the nations did that Jehovah had driven into exile from before them. They kept doing wicked things to offend Jehovah.\n12 They continued to serve disgusting idols, about which Jehovah had told them: \"You must not do this!\" 13 Jehovah kept warning Israel and Judah through all his prophets and every visionary, saying: \"Turn back from your wicked ways! Keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law that I commanded your forefathers and that I sent to you through my servants the prophets.\" 14 But they did not listen, and they remained just as stubborn as their forefathers who had not shown faith in Jehovah their God. 15 They continued rejecting his regulations and his covenant that he had made with their forefathers and his reminders that he had given to warn them, and they kept following worthless idols and became worthless themselves, imitating the nations all around them that Jehovah had commanded them not to imitate.\n16 They kept leaving all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and they made metal statues of two calves and a sacred pole, and they bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served Baal. 17 They also made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire, they practiced divination and looked for omens, and they kept devoting themselves to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, to offend him.\n18 So Jehovah was very angry with Israel, so that he removed them from his sight. He did not let any remain but the tribe of Judah alone.\n19 Even Judah did not keep the commandments of Jehovah their God; they also walked in the customs that Israel followed. 20 Jehovah rejected all the descendants of Israel and humiliated them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them away from before him. 21 He ripped Israel away from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. But Jeroboam caused Israel to stray from following Jehovah, and he caused them to commit a great sin. 22 And the people of Israel kept walking in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed. They did not depart from them 23 until Jehovah removed Israel from his sight, just as he had declared through all his servants the prophets. So Israel was taken into exile from its land to Assyria, where they remain to this day.\n24 The king of Assyria then brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the Israelites; they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities. 25 When they first began dwelling there, they did not fear Jehovah. So Jehovah sent lions among them, and they killed some of the people. 26 It was reported to the king of Assyria: \"The nations that you have taken into exile and resettled in the cities of Samaria do not know the religion of the God of the land. So he keeps sending lions among them, which are putting them to death, because none of them know the religion of the God of the land.\"\n27 At that the king of Assyria commanded: \"Have one of the priests whom you took into exile from there return to live there and to teach them the religion of the God of the land.\" 28 So one of the priests whom they had taken into exile from Samaria came back to live in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should fear Jehovah.\n29 However, each different nation made their own god, which they placed in the houses of worship on the high places that the Samaritans had made; each different nation did so in their cities where they were living. 30 So the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 31 and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. The Sepharvites would burn their sons in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 32 Although they feared Jehovah, they appointed priests for the high places from the people in general, and these officiated for them at the houses of worship on the high places. 33 Thus, they feared Jehovah, but they worshipped their own gods according to the religion of the nations from which they had been deported.\n34 To this day they follow their former religions. None of them worship Jehovah, and none follow his statutes, his judgments, the Law, and the commandment that Jehovah gave the sons of Jacob, whose name he changed to Israel. 35 When Jehovah made a covenant with them, he commanded them: \"You must not fear other gods, and you must not bow down to them or serve them or sacrifice to them. 36 But Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, is the One you should fear, and to him you should bow down, and to him you should sacrifice. 37 And the regulations, the judgments, the Law, and the commandment that he wrote for you, you should always follow carefully, and you must not fear other gods. 38 And you must not forget the covenant that I made with you, and you must not fear other gods. 39 But it is Jehovah your God whom you should fear, as he is the one who will rescue you out of the hand of all your enemies.\"\n40 But they did not obey, and they followed their former religion. 41 So these nations came to fear Jehovah, but they were also serving their own graven images. Both their sons and their grandsons have done just as their forefathers did, down to this day.\nChapter 18\n1 In the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah the king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of King Ahaz of Judah became king. 2 He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 3 He kept doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as David his forefather had done. 4 He was the one who removed the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the sacred pole. He also crushed the copper serpent that Moses had made; for down to that time the people of Israel had been making sacrificial smoke to it and it used to be called the copper serpent-idol. 5 He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel; there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah after him nor among those prior to him. 6 He held fast to Jehovah. He did not turn away from following him; he continued to keep the commandments that Jehovah had given to Moses. 7 And Jehovah was with him. Wherever he went, he acted wisely. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him. 8 He also defeated the Philistines clear to Gaza and its territories, from watchtower to fortified city.\n9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, that is, the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah the king of Israel, King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against Samaria and began to lay siege to it. 10 They captured it at the end of three years; in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of King Hoshea of Israel, Samaria was captured. 11 Then the king of Assyria took Israel into exile in Assyria and settled them in Halah and in Habor at the river Gozan and in the cities of the Medes. 12 This was because they had not listened to the voice of Jehovah their God but kept violating his covenant, all that Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded. They neither listened nor obeyed.\n13 In the 14th year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib the king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 14 So King Hezekiah of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish: \"I am at fault. Withdraw from against me, and I will give whatever you may impose on me.\" The king of Assyria imposed on King Hezekiah of Judah a fine of 300 silver talents and 30 gold talents. 15 So Hezekiah gave all the silver that could be found at the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the king's house. 16 At that time Hezekiah removed the doors of the temple of Jehovah and the doorposts that King Hezekiah of Judah himself had overlaid, and he gave them to the king of Assyria.\n17 The king of Assyria then sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh with a vast army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. They went up to Jerusalem and took up a position by the conduit of the upper pool, which is at the highway of the laundryman's field. 18 When they called for the king to come out, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, Shebnah the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came out to them.\n19 So the Rabshakeh said to them: \"Please, say to Hezekiah, 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: \"What is the basis for your confidence? 20 You are saying, 'I have a strategy and the power to wage war,' but these are empty words. In whom have you put your trust, so that you dare to rebel against me? 21 Look! You trust in the support of this crushed reed, Egypt, which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it. That is the way Pharaoh king of Egypt is to all those who trust in him. 22 And if you should say to me, 'We trust in Jehovah our God,' is he not the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, while he says to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You should bow down before this altar in Jerusalem'?\"' 23 So now make this wager, please, with my lord the king of Assyria: I will give you 2,000 horses if you are able to find enough riders for them. 24 How, then, could you drive back even one governor who is the least of my lord's servants, while you put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 25 Now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come up against this place to destroy it? Jehovah himself said to me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'\"\n26 At this Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and Joah said to the Rabshakeh: \"Speak to your servants, please, in the Aramaic language, for we can understand it; do not speak to us in the language of the Jews in the hearing of the people on the wall.\" 27 But the Rabshakeh said to them: \"Is it just to your lord and to you that my lord sent me to speak these words? Is it not also to the men who sit on the wall, those who will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you?\"\n28 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in the language of the Jews, saying: \"Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 29 This is what the king says, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he is not able to rescue you out of my hand. 30 And do not let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah by saying: \"Jehovah will surely rescue us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\" 31 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: \"Make peace with me and surrender, and each of you will eat from his own vine and from his own fig tree and will drink the water of his own cistern, 32 until I come and take you to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Then you will live and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he misleads you by saying, 'Jehovah will rescue us.' 33 Have any of the gods of the nations rescued their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria out of my hand? 35 Who among all the gods of the lands have rescued their land out of my hand, so that Jehovah should rescue Jerusalem out of my hand?\"'\"\n36 But the people kept silent and did not say a word to him in reply, for the order of the king was, \"You must not answer him.\" 37 But Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the household, Shebnah the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with their garments ripped apart and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.\nChapter 19\n1 As soon as King Hezekiah heard this, he ripped his garments apart and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of Jehovah. 2 Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the household, Shebnah the secretary, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. 3 They said to him: \"This is what Hezekiah says, 'This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; for the children are ready to be born, but there is no strength to give birth. 4 Perhaps Jehovah your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his lord sent to taunt the living God, and he will call him to account for the words that Jehovah your God has heard. So offer up a prayer in behalf of the remnant who have survived.'\"\n5 So the servants of King Hezekiah went in to Isaiah, 6 and Isaiah said to them: \"This is what you should say to your lord, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"Do not be afraid because of the words that you heard, the words with which the attendants of the king of Assyria blasphemed me. 7 Here I am putting a thought in his mind, and he will hear a report and return to his own land; and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.\"'\"\n8 After the Rabshakeh heard that the king of Assyria had pulled away from Lachish, he returned to him and found him fighting against Libnah. 9 Now the king heard it said about King Tirhakah of Ethiopia: \"Here he has come out to fight against you.\" So he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying: 10 \"This is what you should say to King Hezekiah of Judah, 'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying: \"Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.\" 11 Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction. Will you alone be rescued? 12 Did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed rescue them? Where are Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? 13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, and of Hena, and of Ivvah?'\"\n14 Hezekiah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them. Hezekiah then went up to the house of Jehovah and spread them out before Jehovah. 15 And Hezekiah began to pray before Jehovah and say: \"O Jehovah the God of Israel, sitting enthroned above the cherubs, you alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth. 16 Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear! Open your eyes, O Jehovah, and see! Hear the words that Sennacherib has sent to taunt the living God. 17 It is a fact, O Jehovah, that the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands. 18 And they have thrown their gods into the fire, because they were not gods but the work of human hands, wood and stone. That is why they could destroy them. 19 But now, O Jehovah our God, please save us out of his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are God, O Jehovah.\"\n20 Isaiah son of Amoz then sent this message to Hezekiah: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'I have heard your prayer to me concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria. 21 This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him:\n\"The virgin daughter of Zion despises you, she scoffs at you.\nThe daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.\n22 Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?\nAgainst whom have you raised your voice\nAnd lifted your arrogant eyes?\nIt is against the Holy One of Israel!\n23 Through your messengers you have taunted Jehovah and said,\n'With the multitude of my war chariots\nI will ascend the heights of mountains,\nThe remotest parts of Lebanon.\nI will cut down its lofty cedars, its choice juniper trees.\nI will enter its farthest retreats, its densest forests.\n24 I will dig wells and drink foreign waters;\nI will dry up all the streams of Egypt with the soles of my feet.'\n25 Have you not heard? From long ago it was determined.\nFrom days gone by I have prepared it.\nNow I will bring it about.\nYou will turn fortified cities into desolate piles of ruins.\n26 Their inhabitants will be helpless;\nThey will be terrified and put to shame.\nThey will become as vegetation of the field and green grass,\nAs grass of the roofs that is scorched by the east wind.\n27 But I well know when you sit, when you go out, when you come in,\nAnd when you are enraged against me,\n28 Because your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears.\nSo I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle between your lips,\nAnd I will lead you back the way you came.\"\n29 \"'And this will be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows on its own; and in the second year you will eat grain that sprouts from that; but in the third year you will sow seed and reap, and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. 30 Those of the house of Judah who escape, those who are left, will take root downward and produce fruit upward. 31 For a remnant will go out of Jerusalem and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.\n32 \"'Therefore this is what Jehovah says about the king of Assyria:\n\"He will not come into this city\nOr shoot an arrow there\nOr confront it with a shield\nOr cast up a siege rampart against it.\n33 By the way he came he will return;\nHe will not come into this city,\" declares Jehovah.\n34 \"I will defend this city and save it for my own sake\nAnd for the sake of my servant David.\"'\"\n35 On that very night the angel of Jehovah went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose up early in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies. 36 So King Sennacherib of Assyria departed and returned to Nineveh and stayed there. 37 And as he was bowing down at the house of his god Nisroch, his own sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and then escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esar-haddon became king in his place.\nChapter 20\n1 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came and said to him, \"This is what Jehovah says: 'Give instructions to your household, for you will die; you will not recover.'\" 2 At that he turned his face to the wall and began to pray to Jehovah: 3 \"I beg you, O Jehovah, remember, please, how I have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart, and I have done what was good in your eyes.\" And Hezekiah began to weep profusely.\n4 Isaiah had not yet gone out to the middle courtyard when Jehovah's word came to him, saying: 5 \"Go back and say to Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says: \"I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Here I am healing you. On the third day you will go up to the house of Jehovah. 6 I will add 15 years to your life, and I will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.\"'\"\n7 Isaiah then said: \"Bring a cake of pressed dried figs.\" So they brought it and applied it to the boil, after which he gradually recovered.\n8 Hezekiah had asked Isaiah: \"What is the sign to show that Jehovah will heal me and that I will go up on the third day to the house of Jehovah?\" 9 Isaiah replied: \"This is the sign from Jehovah to show you that Jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken: Do you want the shadow on the stairway to move forward ten steps or back ten steps?\" 10 Hezekiah said: \"It is an easy thing for the shadow to extend itself ten steps but not to go back ten steps.\" 11 So Isaiah the prophet called out to Jehovah, and He made the shadow on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps after it had already descended the steps.\n12 At that time the king of Babylon, Berodach-baladan son of Baladan, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. 13 Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his entire treasure-house-the silver, the gold, the balsam oil and other precious oil, his armory, and everything that was to be found in his treasuries. There was nothing that Hezekiah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion.\n14 After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hezekiah and asked him: \"What did these men say, and where did they come from?\" So Hezekiah said: \"They came from a distant land, from Babylon.\" 15 Next he asked: \"What did they see in your house?\" Hezekiah replied: \"They saw everything in my house. There was nothing that I did not show them in my treasuries.\"\n16 Isaiah now said to Hezekiah: \"Hear the word of Jehovah, 17 'Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your house and all that your forefathers have stored up to this day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' says Jehovah. 18 'And some of your own sons to whom you will become father will be taken and will become court officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.'\"\n19 At that Hezekiah said to Isaiah: \"The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good.\" Then he added: \"It is good if there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.\"\n20 As for the rest of the history of Hezekiah, all his mightiness and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought the water into the city, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 21 Then Hezekiah was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Manasseh became king in his place.\nChapter 21\n1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah. 2 He did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the people of Israel. 3 He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed, and he set up altars to Baal and made a sacred pole, just as Ahab the king of Israel had done. And he bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served them. 4 He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, about which Jehovah had said: \"In Jerusalem, I will put my name.\" 5 And he built altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah. 6 And he made his own son pass through the fire; he practiced magic, looked for omens, and appointed spirit mediums and fortune-tellers. He did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, to offend him.\n7 He put the carved image of the sacred pole that he made into the house about which Jehovah had said to David and to his son Solomon: \"In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will permanently put my name. 8 And I will never again make the feet of Israel wander from the land that I gave to their forefathers, provided they carefully observe all that I have commanded them, the entire Law that my servant Moses ordered them to follow.\" 9 But they did not obey, and Manasseh kept leading them astray, causing them to do greater evil than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the Israelites.\n10 Jehovah kept speaking through his servants the prophets, saying: 11 \"Manasseh the king of Judah has done all these detestable things; he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites before him, and he has made Judah sin with his disgusting idols. 12 Therefore this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'Here I am bringing such a disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that it will make both ears of anyone who hears about it tingle. 13 And I will stretch out on Jerusalem the measuring line applied to Samaria and use the leveling tool applied to the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem clean, just as one wipes a bowl clean, wiping it and turning it upside down. 14 I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies, and they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies, 15 because they did what was bad in my eyes and were continually offending me from the day that their forefathers came out of Egypt to this day.'\"\n16 Manasseh also shed innocent blood in very great quantity until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to the other, besides his sin of causing Judah to sin by doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah. 17 As for the rest of the history of Manasseh and all that he did and the sins that he committed, are they not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 18 Then Manasseh was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza; and his son Amon became king in his place.\n19 Amon was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 20 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father Manasseh had done. 21 He kept walking in all the ways that his father walked, and he continued serving and bowing down to the disgusting idols that his father had served. 22 So he abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers, and he did not walk in the way of Jehovah. 23 Eventually Amon's servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house. 24 But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place. 25 As for the rest of the history of Amon, what he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 26 So they buried him in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place.\nChapter 22\n1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath. 2 He did what was right in Jehovah's eyes and walked in all the ways of David his forefather, and he did not deviate to the right or to the left.\n3 In the 18th year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the secretary, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, to the house of Jehovah, saying: 4 \"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and let him collect all the money that is being brought into the house of Jehovah, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people. 5 Have them give it to those appointed over the work in the house of Jehovah who, in turn, will give it to the workers in the house of Jehovah who are to repair the damage to the house, 6 that is, to the craftsmen, the builders, and the masons; and they are to use it to buy timbers and hewn stones to repair the house. 7 But no accounting should be required of them for the money that they are given, because they are trustworthy.\"\n8 Later Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary: \"I have found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.\" So Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who began to read it. 9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and told him: \"Your servants have poured out the money that was found in the house, and they have handed it over to those appointed over the work in the house of Jehovah.\" 10 Shaphan the secretary also told the king: \"There is a book that Hilkiah the priest has given me.\" Then Shaphan began to read it before the king.\n11 As soon as the king heard the words of the book of the Law, he ripped his garments apart. 12 Then the king gave this order to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant: 13 \"Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf, in behalf of the people, and in behalf of all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found; for Jehovah's rage that has been set ablaze against us is great, because our forefathers did not obey the words of this book by observing all that is written concerning us.\"\n14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah son of Harhas, the caretaker of the wardrobe, and she was dwelling in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem; and they spoke to her there. 15 She said to them: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'Tell the man who sent you to me: 16 \"This is what Jehovah says, 'I will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read. 17 Because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the work of their hands, my rage will be set ablaze against this place and it will not be extinguished.'\" 18 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, this is what you should say to him, \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'Regarding the words that you have heard, 19 because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before Jehovah on hearing what I have spoken against this place and its inhabitants-that they would become an object of horror and a curse-and you ripped your garments apart and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares Jehovah. 20 That is why I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be laid in your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place.'\"'\" Then they brought the reply to the king.\nChapter 23\n1 So the king sent word, and they summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 2 After that the king went up to the house of Jehovah with all the men of Judah, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, and the prophets-all the people, from small to great. He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of Jehovah. 3 The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before Jehovah, that he would follow Jehovah and keep his commandments, his reminders, and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul by carrying out the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people agreed to the covenant.\n4 The king then ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second rank, and the doorkeepers to bring out from the temple of Jehovah all the utensils made for Baal, for the sacred pole, and for all the army of the heavens. Then he burned them outside Jerusalem on the terraces of Kidron, and he took their ashes to Bethel. 5 So he put out of business the foreign-god priests, whom the kings of Judah had appointed to make sacrificial smoke on the high places in the cities of Judah and the surroundings of Jerusalem, as well as those making sacrificial smoke to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations of the zodiac, and to all the army of the heavens. 6 He brought the sacred pole out from the house of Jehovah to the outskirts of Jerusalem, to the Kidron Valley, and he burned it in the Kidron Valley and ground it to dust and scattered its dust on the graves of the common people. 7 He also tore down the houses of the male temple prostitutes, which were in the house of Jehovah and where the women were weaving tent shrines for the sacred pole.\n8 Then he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and he made unfit for worship the high places where the priests had been making sacrificial smoke, from Geba to Beer-sheba. He also tore down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the chief of the city, which were on the left as one entered the city gate. 9 The priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread along with their brothers. 10 He also made unfit for worship Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom, so that no one could make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech. 11 And he prohibited the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun from entering the house of Jehovah by the chamber of Nathan-melech the court official, which was in the porticoes; and he burned the chariots of the sun in the fire. 12 The king also tore down the altars that the kings of Judah had set up on the roof of Ahaz's upper chamber, as well as the altars that Manasseh had set up in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah. He crushed them and scattered their dust in the Kidron Valley. 13 And the king made unfit for worship the high places in front of Jerusalem that were to the south of the Mount of Ruination, which Solomon the king of Israel had built to Ashtoreth the disgusting goddess of the Sidonians; and to Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab; and to Milcom the detestable god of the Ammonites. 14 He broke the sacred pillars to pieces and cut down the sacred poles and filled their places with human bones. 15 He also tore down the altar in Bethel, the high place that Jeroboam the son of Nebat had made that caused Israel to sin. After tearing down that altar and the high place, he burned the high place, ground it to dust, and burned the sacred pole.\n16 When Josiah turned and saw the graves on the mountain, he had the bones taken from the graves and burned them on the altar, making it unfit for worship, according to Jehovah's word that had been proclaimed by the man of the true God who foretold that these things would happen. 17 Then he said: \"What is the gravestone over there that I am looking at?\" At this the men of the city said to him: \"It is the grave of the man of the true God from Judah who foretold these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.\" 18 So he said: \"Let him rest. Do not let anyone disturb his bones.\" So they left his bones undisturbed, as well as the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.\n19 Josiah also removed all the houses of worship on the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had built to offend God, and he did the same thing to them that he had done at Bethel. 20 So he sacrificed on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there, and he burned human bones on them. After that he returned to Jerusalem.\n21 The king now commanded all the people: \"Hold a Passover to Jehovah your God as is written in this book of the covenant.\" 22 No Passover like this had been held since the days when the judges had judged Israel or in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. 23 But in the 18th year of King Josiah, this Passover to Jehovah was held in Jerusalem.\n24 Josiah also cleared out the spirit mediums, the fortune-tellers, the teraphim statues, the disgusting idols, and all the disgusting things that had appeared in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, in order to carry out the words of the Law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of Jehovah. 25 There was no king like him prior to him, who returned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses; nor did anyone like him rise up after him.\n26 Nevertheless, Jehovah did not turn away from his burning anger that blazed against Judah because of all the offensive things that Manasseh had done to offend Him. 27 Jehovah said: \"I will also remove Judah from my sight, just as I removed Israel; and I will reject this city that I chose, Jerusalem, and the house about which I said, 'My name will continue there.'\"\n28 As for the rest of the history of Josiah, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 29 In his days Pharaoh Nechoh the king of Egypt came to meet the king of Assyria by the Euphrates River, and King Josiah went out to confront him; but when Nechoh saw him, he put him to death at Megiddo. 30 So his servants transported his dead body in a chariot from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave. Then the people of the land took Josiah's son Jehoahaz and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.\n31 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 32 He began to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, according to all that his forefathers had done. 33 Pharaoh Nechoh imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, to keep him from reigning in Jerusalem, and then imposed on the land a fine of 100 silver talents and a gold talent. 34 Furthermore, Pharaoh Nechoh made Josiah's son Eliakim king in place of his father Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but he took Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt, where he eventually died. 35 Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he had to tax the land to give the silver that Pharaoh demanded. He exacted an assessed amount of silver and gold from each of the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Nechoh.\n36 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah. 37 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, according to all that his forefathers had done.\nChapter 24\n1 In Jehoiakim's days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against him, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. However, he turned against him and rebelled. 2 Then Jehovah began to send against him marauder bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites. He kept sending them against Judah to destroy it, according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken through his servants the prophets. 3 Surely it was by the order of Jehovah that this happened to Judah, to remove them from his sight because of all the sins that Manasseh had committed, 4 and also the innocent blood that he had shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood and Jehovah was not willing to forgive.\n5 As for the rest of the history of Jehoiakim, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 6 Then Jehoiakim was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.\n7 Never again did the king of Egypt venture out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Wadi of Egypt up to the Euphrates River.\n8 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 9 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, according to all that his father had done. 10 During that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. 11 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city while his servants were laying siege to it.\n12 King Jehoiachin of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, along with his mother, his servants, his princes, and his court officials; and the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign. 13 Then he took out from there all the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king's house. He cut into pieces all the gold utensils that Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah. This happened just as Jehovah had foretold. 14 He took into exile all Jerusalem, all the princes, all the mighty warriors, and every craftsman and metalworker-he took 10,000 into exile. No one was left behind except the poorest people of the land. 15 Thus he took Jehoiachin into exile to Babylon; he also led away the king's mother, the king's wives, his court officials, and the foremost men of the land, taking them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 16 The king of Babylon also took into exile to Babylon all the warriors, 7,000, as well as 1,000 craftsmen and metalworkers, all of them mighty men and trained for war. 17 The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.\n18 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 19 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 20 It was because of Jehovah's anger that these things took place in Jerusalem and in Judah, until he cast them out of his sight. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.\nChapter 25\n1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem. He camped against it and built a siege wall all around it, 2 and the city was under siege until the 11th year of King Zedekiah. 3 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land. 4 The city wall was broken through, and all the soldiers fled by night through the gate between the double wall near the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were surrounding the city; and the king went by the way of the Arabah. 5 But the Chaldean army pursued the king, and they overtook him in the desert plains of Jericho, and all his troops were scattered from his side. 6 Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him. 7 They slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes; then Nebuchadnezzar blinded Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with copper fetters, and brought him to Babylon.\n8 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, that is, in the 19th year of King Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard, the servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. 9 He burned down the house of Jehovah, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; he also burned down the house of every prominent man. 10 And the walls surrounding Jerusalem were pulled down by the entire Chaldean army that was with the chief of the guard. 11 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took into exile the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the population. 12 But the chief of the guard left some of the poorest people of the land to serve as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers. 13 And the Chaldeans broke into pieces the copper pillars of the house of Jehovah and the carriages and the copper Sea that were in the house of Jehovah, and they carried the copper away to Babylon. 14 They also took the cans, the shovels, the extinguishers, the cups, and all the copper utensils used in the temple service. 15 The chief of the guard took the fire holders and the bowls that were of genuine gold and silver. 16 As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the carriages that Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the copper of all these articles was beyond weighing. 17 Each pillar was 18 cubits high, and the capital on it was of copper; and the height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around on the capital were all made of copper. The second pillar with its network was like it.\n18 The chief of the guard also took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. 19 And he took from the city one court official who was the commissioner over the soldiers, five close associates of the king who were found in the city, as well as the secretary of the chief of the army, the one mustering the people of the land, and 60 men of the common people of the land who were yet found in the city. 20 Nebuzaradan the chief of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 21 The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah went into exile from its land.\n22 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan over the people whom he had left behind in the land of Judah. 23 When all the army chiefs and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they immediately came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They were Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, together with their men. 24 Gedaliah swore an oath to them and their men and said to them: \"Do not be afraid of being servants to the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.\"\n25 And in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, who was of the royal line, came with ten other men, and they struck down Gedaliah and he died, along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him in Mizpah. 26 After that all the people, from small to great, including the army chiefs, rose up and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.\n27 And in the 37th year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, in the 12th month, on the 27th day of the month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year he became king, released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison. 28 He spoke kindly with him and put his throne higher than the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 29 So Jehoiachin took off his prison garments, and he regularly ate before him all the days of his life. 30 A regular allowance of food was given him from the king, day after day, all the days of his life. \n",

Those who previously lived there were Hamites. 41 These whose names are listed came during the days of King Hezekiah of Judah and struck down the tents of the Hamites and the Meunim who were there. They devoted them to destruction down to this day; and they settled in their place because there were pastures for their flocks there.\n42 Some of the Simeonites, 500 men, went to Mount Seir with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi who led them. 43 And they struck down the rest of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they have lived there down to this day.\nChapter 5\n1 These are the sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn. He was the firstborn, but because he defiled the bed of his father, his right as firstborn was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so he was not enrolled genealogically for the right of the firstborn. 2 Though Judah was superior to his brothers and from him came the one to be the leader, the right as firstborn belonged to Joseph. 3 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 4 The sons of Joel were Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, 5 Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son, 6 and Beerah his son, whom King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria took into exile; he was a chieftain of the Reubenites. 7 His brothers by their families in the genealogical enrollment by their descendants were, as the head, Jeiel, Zechariah, 8 and Bela son of Azaz son of Shema son of Joel, who lived in Aroer and as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. 9 To the east he settled as far as the beginning of the wilderness at the Euphrates River, for their livestock had become numerous in the land of Gilead. 10 In the days of Saul, they waged war against the Hagrites, who were defeated before them, so they dwelled in their tents throughout all the territory east of Gilead.\n11 Now the descendants of Gad lived next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah. 12 Joel was the head, Shapham the second, and Janai and Shaphat in Bashan. 13 And their brothers belonging to their paternal houses were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber, seven in all. 14 These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri son of Jaroah son of Gilead son of Michael son of Jeshishai son of Jahdo son of Buz. 15 Ahi son of Abdiel son of Guni was head of their paternal house. 16 They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its dependent towns, and in all the pastures of Sharon as far as they extended. 17 They were all enrolled genealogically in the days of King Jotham of Judah and in the days of King Jeroboam of Israel.\n18 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 mighty warriors in their army who carried shields and swords and were armed with bows, and they were trained in war. 19 They waged war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 20 And they were helped in fighting them, so that the Hagrites and all who were with them were given into their hand, for they called to God for help in the war, and he responded to their entreaty because they trusted in him. 21 They captured their livestock-50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys-as well as 100,000 people. 22 Many had fallen slain, because the war was waged by the true God. And they lived in their place until the time of the exile.\n23 The descendants of the half tribe of Manasseh lived in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon. They were numerous. 24 These were the heads of their paternal houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel; they were mighty warriors, men of fame, and heads of their paternal houses. 25 But they acted unfaithfully toward the God of their forefathers and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had annihilated from before them. 26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of King Pul of Assyria (that is, King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria) so that he took into exile those of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river Gozan, where they are until this day.\nChapter 6\n1 The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 2 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 3 The children of Amram were Aaron, Moses, and also Miriam.

All of these were the sons of Azel. 39 And the sons of his brother Eshek were Ulam his firstborn, Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third. 40 And the sons of Ulam were mighty warriors who could handle the bow, and they had many sons and grandsons, numbering 150. All of these were descendants of Benjamin.\nChapter 9\n1 All the Israelites were enrolled genealogically, and they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel. And Judah was taken into exile to Babylon for its unfaithfulness. 2 The first inhabitants to return to their possession in their cities were some Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants. 3 And some of the descendants of Judah, of Benjamin, of Ephraim, and of Manasseh settled in Jerusalem: 4 Uthai son of Ammihud son of Omri son of Imri son of Bani, of the descendants of Perez son of Judah. 5 And of the Shilonites, Asaiah the firstborn and his sons. 6 And of the sons of Zerah, Jeuel and 690 of their brothers.\n7 And of the descendants of Benjamin, Sallu son of Meshullam son of Hodaviah son of Hassenuah, 8 Ibneiah son of Jeroham, Elah son of Uzzi son of Michri, and Meshullam son of Shephatiah son of Reuel son of Ibnijah. 9 And their brothers by line of descent were 956. All these men were heads of their paternal houses.\n10 And of the priests, there were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, 11 Azariah son of Hilkiah son of Meshullam son of Zadok son of Meraioth son of Ahitub, a leader of the house of the true God, 12 Adaiah son of Jeroham son of Pashhur son of Malchijah, Maasai son of Adiel son of Jahzerah son of Meshullam son of Meshillemith son of Immer, 13 and their brothers, heads of the paternal houses, 1,760 mighty, capable men available for the service of the house of the true God.\n14 And of the Levites, there were Shemaiah son of Hasshub son of Azrikam son of Hashabiah from the descendants of Merari; 15 and Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, Mattaniah son of Mica son of Zichri son of Asaph, 16 Obadiah son of Shemaiah son of Galal son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah son of Asa son of Elkanah, who was dwelling in the settlements of the Netophathites.\n17 The gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brother Shallum the head, 18 and until then he was at the king's gate to the east. These were the gatekeepers of the camps of the Levites. 19 And Shallum son of Kore son of Ebiasaph son of Korah, and his brothers of his paternal house, the Korahites, were over the duties of the service, the doorkeepers of the tent, and their fathers had been over the camp of Jehovah as the keepers of the entryway. 20 It was Phinehas the son of Eleazar who had been their leader in the past; Jehovah was with him. 21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper of the entrance of the tent of meeting.\n22 All those selected as gatekeepers at the thresholds numbered 212. They were in their settlements by their genealogical enrollment. David and Samuel the seer appointed these to their office of trust. 23 They and their sons were over the guard service for the gates of the house of Jehovah, the house of the tent. 24 The gatekeepers were on the four sides-east, west, north, and south. 25 From time to time, their brothers were to come in from their settlements for seven days to serve along with them. 26 There were four chief gatekeepers in the office of trust. They were Levites, and they were in charge of the chambers and of the treasuries of the house of the true God. 27 They would spend the night in their stations all around the house of the true God, for they cared for the guard service and were in charge of the key and would open up the house from morning to morning.\n28 Some of them were in charge of the utensils of the service; they would count them when they brought them in and count them when they took them out. 29 Some of them were appointed over the utensils, over all the holy utensils, and over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the balsam oil. 30 Some of the sons of the priests mixed the ointment of balsam oil. 31 And Mattithiah of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in the office of trust over the things baked in pans. 32 Some of their brothers of the Kohathites were in charge of the layer bread, to prepare it every sabbath.\n33 These were the singers, the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites in the chambers, those set free from other duties; for by day and by night it was their responsibility to be on duty. 34 These were the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites by their line of descent, headmen. These lived in Jerusalem.\n35 The father of Gibeon, Jeiel, lived in Gibeon. His wife's name was Maacah. 36 And his firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 38 Mikloth became father to Shimeam. And they all lived near their brothers in Jerusalem, along with their other brothers. 39 Ner became father to Kish; Kish became father to Saul; Saul became father to Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 40 And Jonathan's son was Merib-baal. Merib-baal became father to Micah. 41 And the sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 42 Ahaz became father to Jarah; Jarah became father to Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri became father to Moza. 43 Moza became father to Binea and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 44 Azel had six sons, and their names were Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.\nChapter 10\n1 Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel. And the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 2 The Philistines kept in close range of Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons. 3 The fighting grew fierce against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers. 4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer: \"Draw your sword and run me through with it, so that these uncircumcised men may not come and deal ruthlessly with me.\" But his armor-bearer was unwilling, because he was very much afraid. So Saul took the sword and fell on it. 5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died. 6 Thus Saul and his three sons died, and all those of his house died together. 7 When all the people of Israel in the valley saw that everyone had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they began to abandon their cities and flee; the Philistines then came and occupied them.\n8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 9 So they stripped him and took off his head and his armor, and they sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the news to their idols and the people. 10 Then they put his armor in the house of their god and fastened his skull to the house of Dagon.\n11 When all those of Jabesh in Gilead heard about all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 12 all the warriors rose up and carried off the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons. They brought them to Jabesh and buried their bones under the big tree in Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.\n13 Thus Saul died for the unfaithfulness he had shown against Jehovah because he had not obeyed the word of Jehovah, also for consulting a spirit medium 14 instead of inquiring of Jehovah. So He put him to death and turned the kingship over to David the son of Jesse.\nChapter 11\n1 In time all the Israelites gathered to David at Hebron and said: \"Look! We are your own bone and flesh. 2 In times past while Saul was king, you were the one who was leading Israel on its campaigns. And Jehovah your God said to you: 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become leader over my people Israel.'\" 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah. Then they anointed David as king over Israel, according to Jehovah's word through Samuel.\n4 Later David and all Israel set out for Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were inhabiting the land. 5 The inhabitants of Jebus taunted David: \"You will never come in here!\" However, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now the City of David. 6 So David said: \"Whoever is the first to strike the Jebusites will become chief and prince.\" And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and he became the chief. 7 Then David took up residence in the stronghold. That is why they called it the City of David. 8 He began to build up the city all around, from the Mound to the areas around it, and Joab restored the rest of the city. 9 Thus David became greater and greater, and Jehovah of armies was with him.\n10 Now these are the heads of David's mighty warriors, who gave him strong support in his kingship, together with all Israel, to make him king according to Jehovah's word concerning Israel. 11 This is the list of David's mighty warriors: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, the head of the three. He brandished his spear over 300 slain at one time. 12 Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite. He was among the three mighty warriors. 13 He was with David at Pas-dammim, where the Philistines had gathered together for war. Now there was a plot of land full of barley, and the people had fled because of the Philistines. 14 But he took his stand in the middle of the field and defended it and kept striking down the Philistines, so that Jehovah brought about a great victory.\n15 Three of the 30 headmen went down to the rock, to David at the cave of Adullam, while a Philistine army was camped in the Valley of Rephaim. 16 David was then in the stronghold, and a garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. 17 Then David expressed his longing: \"If only I could have a drink of the water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem!\" 18 At that the three forced their way into the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the cistern by the gate of Bethlehem and brought it to David; but David refused to drink it and poured it out to Jehovah. 19 He said: \"It is unthinkable on my part from the standpoint of my God to do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives? For it was at the risk of their lives that they brought it.\" So he refused to drink it. These are the things that his three mighty warriors did.\n20 Abishai the brother of Joab became head of another three; he brandished his spear over 300 slain, and he had a reputation like the three. 21 Of the other three, he was more distinguished than two of them, and he was their chief; yet he did not attain to the rank of the first three.\n22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a courageous man who performed many exploits in Kabzeel. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab, and he descended into a waterpit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 23 He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size-five cubits tall. Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of loom workers, he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. 24 These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors. 25 Although he was distinguished even more than the thirty, he did not attain to the rank of the three. However, David appointed him over his own bodyguard.\n26 The mighty warriors of the military forces were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi-ezer the Anathothite, 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjaminites, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 32 Hurai of the wadis of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah; 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a head of the Reubenites, and 30 with him; 43 Hanan the son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite, 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel, the sons of Hotham the Aroerite; 45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother the Tizite; 46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite; 47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.\nChapter 12\n1 These were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was unable to move about freely because of Saul the son of Kish, and they were among the mighty warriors who supported him in battle. 2 They were armed with the bow, and they could use both the right hand and the left hand to sling stones or to shoot arrows with the bow. They were of the brothers of Saul, from Benjamin. 3 The head was Ahiezer, along with Joash, both sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth, Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite, 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty warrior among the thirty and over the thirty; also Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite, 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Hariphite, 6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; 7 and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.\n8 Some of the Gadites went over to David's side at the stronghold in the wilderness; they were mighty warriors, soldiers trained for war, standing ready with the large shield and the lance, whose faces were like those of lions and who were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains. 9 Ezer was the head, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. 14 These were of the Gadites, heads of the army. The least one was equal to 100, and the greatest to 1,000. 15 These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing its banks, and they chased away all those living in the lowlands, to the east and to the west.\n16 Some of the men of Benjamin and Judah also came to David at his stronghold. 17 Then David went out before them and said to them: \"If you have come to me in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you. But if it is to betray me to my adversaries when my hands have done no wrong, let the God of our forefathers see it and judge.\" 18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, the head of the thirty:\n\"We are yours, O David, and we are with you, O son of Jesse.\nPeace, peace be yours, and peace to the one helping you,\nFor your God is helping you.\"\nSo David received them and appointed them among the heads of the troops.\n19 Some from Manasseh also deserted to David when he came with the Philistines to battle against Saul; but he did not help the Philistines, for after consultation, the lords of the Philistines sent him away, saying: \"He will desert to his lord Saul, and it will cost us our heads.\" 20 When he went to Ziklag, these deserted to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, heads of the thousands of Manasseh. 21 They helped David against the marauder band, because all of them were mighty, courageous men, and they became chiefs in the army. 22 Day after day people kept coming to David to help him until it was a camp as great as the camp of God.\n23 This is the number of the heads of those armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn the kingship of Saul over to him according to Jehovah's order. 24 The men of Judah carrying the large shield and the lance were 6,800, armed for battle. 25 Of the Simeonites, the mighty, courageous men of the army were 7,100.\n26 Of the Levites, 4,600. 27 Jehoiada was the leader of the sons of Aaron, and with him were 3,700, 28 as well as Zadok, a mighty and courageous young man, along with 22 chiefs from his paternal house.\n29 Of the Benjaminites, the brothers of Saul, there were 3,000, of whom the greater number had previously been guarding the interests of the house of Saul. 30 Of the Ephraimites, there were 20,800 mighty, courageous men of fame among their paternal houses.\n31 Of the half tribe of Manasseh, there were 18,000 who had been designated by name to come to make David king. 32 Of the tribe of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, there were 200 of their headmen, and all their brothers were under their command. 33 Of Zebulun, there were 50,000 who could serve in the army, drawing up in battle formation with all the weapons of war, all joining David with undivided loyalty. 34 Of Naphtali, there were 1,000 chiefs, and with them were 37,000 with the large shield and the spear. 35 Of the Danites, those drawing up in battle formation were 28,600. 36 And of Asher, those who could serve in the army for drawing up in battle formation were 40,000.\n37 From across the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 soldiers with all kinds of weapons of war. 38 All of these were men of war, joining together in battle line; they came with a complete heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel, and also all the rest of Israel were united in wanting to make David king. 39 And they remained there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them. 40 Also those near them, and even those as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and cattle-provisions of flour, cakes of pressed figs and raisins, wine, oil, and cattle and sheep in great quantity, for there was rejoicing in Israel.\nChapter 13\n1 David consulted with the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds and with every leader. 2 Then David said to all the congregation of Israel: \"If it seems good to you and it is acceptable to Jehovah our God, let us send word to our remaining brothers in all regions of Israel and also to the priests and the Levites in their cities with pastures to come and join us. 3 And let us bring back the Ark of our God.\" For they had not cared for it in the days of Saul. 4 All the congregation agreed to do that, for it seemed right to all the people. 5 So David congregated all Israel, from the river of Egypt as far as Lebo-hamath, to bring the Ark of the true God from Kiriath-jearim.\n6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the Ark of the true God, Jehovah, who sits enthroned above the cherubs, where his name is called on. 7 However, they placed the Ark of the true God on a new wagon and brought it from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio were leading the wagon. 8 David and all Israel were celebrating before the true God with all their might, accompanied by songs, harps, other stringed instruments, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 9 But when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah thrust his hand out and grabbed hold of the Ark, for the cattle nearly upset it. 10 At that Jehovah's anger blazed against Uzzah, and He struck him down because he had thrust his hand out to the Ark, and he died there before God. 11 But David became angry because Jehovah's wrath had broken through against Uzzah; and that place has been called Perez-uzzah down to this day.\n12 So David became fearful of the true God on that day and said: \"How can I bring the Ark of the true God to me?\" 13 David did not bring the Ark to where he was in the City of David, but he had it taken to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 14 The Ark of the true God was with the household of Obed-edom, remaining at his house for three months, and Jehovah kept blessing the household of Obed-edom and all he had.\nChapter 14\n1 King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timbers, stonemasons, and woodworkers to build a house for him. 2 And David knew that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel, for his kingship was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.\n3 David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David became father to more sons and daughters. 4 These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.\n8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Israel, all the Philistines came up to search for David. When David heard about it, he went out against them. 9 Then the Philistines came in and kept making raids in the Valley of Rephaim. 10 David inquired of God, saying: \"Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?\" At this Jehovah said to him: \"Go up, and I will surely give them into your hand.\" 11 So David went up to Baal-perazim, and he struck them down there. At that David said: \"The true God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a breach made by waters.\" That is why they named that place Baal-perazim. 12 The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and when David gave the order, these were burned in the fire.\n13 Later the Philistines once again made a raid in the valley. 14 David again inquired of God, but the true God said to him: \"Do not go directly up after them. Instead, go around behind them, and come against them in front of the baca bushes. 15 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the baca bushes, launch your attack, for the true God will have gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.\" 16 So David did just as the true God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 17 And David's fame spread into all the lands, and Jehovah put the dread of him upon all the nations.\nChapter 15\n1 And he continued building houses for himself in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the Ark of the true God and pitched a tent for it. 2 It was then that David said: \"No one is to carry the Ark of the true God except the Levites, for Jehovah has chosen them to carry the Ark of Jehovah and to minister to him always.\" 3 Then David congregated all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the Ark of Jehovah up to the place that he had prepared for it.\n4 David gathered the descendants of Aaron and the Levites: 5 from the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his brothers; 6 from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his brothers; 7 from the Gershomites, Joel the chief and 130 of his brothers; 8 from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his brothers; 9 from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the chief and 80 of his brothers; 10 from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his brothers. 11 Furthermore, David called the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 12 and he said to them: \"You are the heads of the paternal houses of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, you and your brothers, and bring the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel up to the place that I have prepared for it. 13 Since you did not carry it the first time, the anger of Jehovah our God broke out against us, because we did not search out the proper procedure.\" 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.\n15 Then the Levites carried the Ark of the true God on their shoulders with the poles, just as Moses had commanded by Jehovah's word. 16 David then told the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers to sing out joyfully, accompanied by musical instruments: stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals.\n17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel and, of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah and, of the Merarites their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah. 18 Together with them were their brothers of the second division, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel the gatekeepers. 19 The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to play the copper cymbals; 20 and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played stringed instruments tuned to Alamoth; 21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah played harps tuned to Sheminith, to act as directors. 22 Chenaniah the chief of the Levites supervised the transport, for he was an expert, 23 and Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the Ark. 24 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer loudly sounded the trumpets before the Ark of the true God, and Obed-edom and Jehiah also served as gatekeepers for the Ark.\n25 Then David and the elders of Israel and the chiefs of the thousands were walking along to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing. 26 When the true God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven young bulls and seven rams. 27 David was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric, as were all the Levites carrying the Ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the chief of the transport and the singers; David was also wearing a linen ephod. 28 All the Israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with joyful shouting, with the sound of the horn, with trumpets, with cymbals, playing loudly on stringed instruments and harps.\n29 But when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, Saul's daughter Michal looked down through the window and saw King David skipping about and celebrating; and she began to despise him in her heart.\nChapter 16\n1 So they brought the Ark of the true God in and placed it inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and they presented burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before the true God. 2 When David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah. 3 Further, he distributed to all the Israelites, to each man and woman, a round loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. 4 Then he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the Ark of Jehovah, to honor, thank, and praise Jehovah the God of Israel. 5 Asaph was the head, and second to him was Zechariah; and Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel played stringed instruments and harps; and Asaph played the cymbals, 6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests blew the trumpets constantly before the ark of the covenant of the true God.\n7 It was on that day that David first contributed a song of thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brothers:\n8 \"Give thanks to Jehovah, call on his name,\nMake his deeds known among the peoples!\n9 Sing to him, sing praises to him,\nPonder over all his wonderful works.\n10 Boast about his holy name.\nLet the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.\n11 Search for Jehovah and his strength.\nSeek his face constantly.\n12 Remember the wonderful works he has performed,\nHis miracles and the judgments he has pronounced,\n13 You offspring of Israel his servant,\nYou sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.\n14 He is Jehovah our God.\nHis judgments are throughout the earth.\n15 Remember his covenant forever,\nThe promise he made, to a thousand generations,\n16 The covenant he made with Abraham,\nAnd the oath he swore to Isaac,\n17 Which he established as a decree to Jacob\nAnd as a lasting covenant to Israel,\n18 Saying, 'I will give you the land of Canaan\nAs your allotted inheritance.'\n19 This was when you were few in number,\nYes, very few, and you were foreigners in the land.\n20 They walked about from nation to nation,\nFrom one kingdom to another people.\n21 He did not allow any man to oppress them,\nBut on their account he reproved kings,\n22 Saying, 'Do not touch my anointed ones,\nAnd to my prophets do nothing bad.'\n23 Sing to Jehovah, all the earth!\nAnnounce his salvation day after day!\n24 Declare his glory among the nations,\nHis wonderful works among all the peoples.\n25 For Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise.\nHe is more awe-inspiring than all other gods.\n26 All the gods of the peoples are worthless gods,\nBut Jehovah is the one who made the heavens.\n27 In his presence are majesty and splendor;\nStrength and joy are in his dwelling place.\n28 Give Jehovah his due, you families of the peoples,\nGive Jehovah his due for his glory and strength.\n29 Give Jehovah the glory due his name;\nBring a gift and come in before him.\nBow down to Jehovah in holy adornment.\n30 Tremble before him, all the earth!\nThe earth is firmly established; it cannot be moved.\n31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be joyful;\nDeclare among the nations: 'Jehovah has become King!'\n32 Let the sea thunder and all that fills it;\nLet the fields and everything in them rejoice.\n33 At the same time let the trees of the forest shout joyfully before Jehovah,\nFor he is coming to judge the earth.\n34 Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;\nHis loyal love endures forever.\n35 And say, 'Save us, O God of our salvation,\nGather us and rescue us from the nations,\nSo that we may give thanks to your holy name\nAnd exult in praising you.\n36 May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praised\nThroughout all eternity.'\"\nAnd all the people said, \"Amen!\" and they praised Jehovah.\n37 Then David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to minister continually before the Ark, according to the daily routine. 38 Obed-edom and his brothers, numbering 68, and Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were gatekeepers; 39 and Zadok the priest and his fellow priests were before the tabernacle of Jehovah on the high place at Gibeon 40 to offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah regularly on the altar of burnt offering, morning and evening, and to do all that is written in the Law of Jehovah that he commanded Israel. 41 With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of the selected men who were designated by their names to thank Jehovah, because \"his loyal love endures forever\"; 42 and with them were Heman and Jeduthun to sound the trumpets, cymbals, and the instruments used to praise the true God; and the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate. 43 Then all the people went to their homes, and David went to bless his own household.\nChapter 17\n1 As soon as David was settled in his own house, he said to Nathan the prophet: \"Here I am living in a house of cedars while the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under tent cloths.\" 2 Nathan replied to David: \"Do whatever is in your heart, for the true God is with you.\"\n3 On that very night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying: 4 \"Go and say to my servant David, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"You are not the one who will build the house for me to dwell in. 5 For I have not dwelled in a house from the day I brought Israel out to this day, but I continued going from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another. 6 During all the time that I went with all Israel, did I ever say one word to any of the judges of Israel whom I appointed to shepherd my people, saying, 'Why did you not build a house of cedars for me?'\"'\n7 \"Now say this to my servant David, 'This is what Jehovah of armies says: \"I took you from the pastures, from following the flock, to become a leader over my people Israel. 8 And I will be with you wherever you go, and I will do away with all your enemies from before you; and I will make a name for you like the name of the great men of the earth. 9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel and settle them, and they will live there and not be disturbed anymore; and wicked men will not oppress them again as they did in the past, 10 from the day that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I tell you, 'Jehovah will build a house for you.'\n11 \"'\"When your days come to an end and you go to be with your forefathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your sons, and I will firmly establish his kingship. 12 He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will firmly establish his throne forever. 13 I will become his father, and he will become my son. I will not remove my loyal love from him the way I removed it from the one who was prior to you. 14 I will cause him to stand in my house and in my kingship forever, and his throne will last forever.\"'\"\n15 Nathan told David all these words and this entire vision.\n16 At that King David came in and sat down before Jehovah and said: \"Who am I, O Jehovah God? And what is my house that you have brought me this far? 17 As if this were not enough, O God, you also speak about the house of your servant down to a distant future time, and you have looked on me as if I were a man who should be further exalted, O Jehovah God. 18 What more can your servant David say to you about the honor given me when you know your servant so well? 19 O Jehovah, for the sake of your servant and in agreement with your heart you have done all these great things by revealing your greatness. 20 O Jehovah, there is no one like you, and there is no God except you; everything we have heard with our ears confirms this. 21 And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel? The true God went and redeemed them as his people. You made a name for yourself by your great and awe-inspiring deeds, driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt. 22 You made your people Israel your own people for all time; and you, O Jehovah, became their God. 23 Now, O Jehovah, may the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house prove faithful for all time, and may you do just as you have promised. 24 May your name endure and be exalted forever, so that people may say, 'Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, is God to Israel,' and may the house of your servant David be firmly established before you. 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant your purpose to build him a house. That is why your servant has the confidence to offer this prayer to you. 26 And now, O Jehovah, you are the true God, and you have promised these good things concerning your servant. 27 So may it please you to bless the house of your servant, and may it continue forever before you, for you, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.\"\nChapter 18\n1 Some time later, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and its dependent towns out of the hands of the Philistines. 2 Then he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants and brought tribute.\n3 David defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah near Hamath as he was on his way to establish his authority at the Euphrates River. 4 David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers from him. Then David hamstrung all but 100 of the chariot horses. 5 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 of the Syrians. 6 David then established garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became David's servants and brought tribute. Jehovah gave David victory wherever he went. 7 Moreover, David took the circular shields of gold from the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 8 From Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a great quantity of copper. With it Solomon made the copper Sea, the pillars, and the copper utensils.\n9 When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah, 10 he immediately sent his son Hadoram to King David to ask about his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought and defeated Hadadezer (for Hadadezer had often fought against Tou), and he brought all sorts of articles of gold, silver, and copper. 11 King David sanctified these to Jehovah, along with the silver and the gold that he had carried off from all the nations: from Edom and Moab, from the Ammonites, the Philistines, and the Amalekites.\n12 Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 13 He established garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Jehovah gave David victory wherever he went. 14 David kept reigning over all Israel, and he was administering justice and righteousness for all his people. 15 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder, 16 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was secretary. 17 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And David's sons were first in position next to the king.\nChapter 19\n1 Later Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son became king in his place. 2 At that David said: \"I will show loyal love toward Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed loyal love toward me.\" So David sent messengers to offer him comfort over the loss of his father. But when David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun, 3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun: \"Do you think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you? Is it not to make a thorough search and to overthrow you and to spy out the land that his servants have come to you?\" 4 So Hanun took the servants of David and shaved them and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away. 5 When David was told about the men, he at once sent others to meet them, because the men had been deeply humiliated; and the king told them: \"Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, and then return.\"\n6 In time the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, so Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 silver talents to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. 7 Thus they hired 32,000 chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his people. Then they came and camped before Medeba. The Ammonites gathered together from their cities and came out for the battle.\n8 When David heard about it, he sent Joab and the entire army, including his mightiest warriors. 9 And the Ammonites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open field.\n10 When Joab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear, he chose some of the best troops in Israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the Syrians. 11 He put the rest of the men under the command of his brother Abishai, in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the Ammonites. 12 Then he said: \"If the Syrians become too strong for me, then you must come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites become too strong for you, I will rescue you. 13 We must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah will do what is good in his eyes.\"\n14 Then Joab and his men advanced to meet the Syrians in battle, and they fled from before him. 15 When the Ammonites saw that the Syrians had fled, they also fled from his brother Abishai and went into the city. After that Joab came to Jerusalem.\n16 When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to summon the Syrians in the region of the River, with Shophach the chief of the army of Hadadezer leading them.\n17 When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up in battle formation against them. David drew up in battle formation to meet the Syrians, and they fought against him. 18 But the Syrians fled from Israel; and David killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers of the Syrians, and he put Shophach the chief of the army to death. 19 When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they promptly made peace with David and became his subjects; and Syria did not want to help the Ammonites anymore.\nChapter 20\n1 At the start of the year, at the time when kings go on campaigns, Joab led a military expedition and devastated the land of the Ammonites; he came and besieged Rabbah, while David stayed in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and tore it down. 2 Then David took the crown of Malcam from its head, and found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it there were precious stones; and it was placed on David's head. He also took a vast amount of spoil from the city. 3 And he brought out the people who were in it and put them to work at sawing stones and at working with sharp iron instruments and with axes. That was what David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Finally David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.\n4 After this, war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was a descendant of the Rephaim, and they were subdued.\n5 And there was war again with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like the beam of loom workers.\n6 War broke out yet again at Gath, where there was a man of extraordinary size, with 6 fingers on each hand and 6 toes on each foot, 24 in all; and he too was a descendant of the Rephaim. 7 He kept taunting Israel. So Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, struck him down.\n8 These were descendants of the Rephaim in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.\nChapter 21\n1 Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to number Israel. 2 So David said to Joab and the chiefs of the people: \"Go, count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan; then report to me so that I may know their number.\" 3 But Joab said: \"May Jehovah multiply his people 100 times! My lord the king, are not all of them already servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?\"\n4 But the king's word prevailed over Joab. So Joab went out and traveled throughout Israel, after which he came to Jerusalem. 5 Joab now gave to David the number of the people who were registered. All Israel amounted to 1,100,000 men armed with swords, and Judah, 470,000 men armed with swords. 6 But Levi and Benjamin were not registered among them, because the king's word was detestable to Joab.\n7 Now this was very displeasing to the true God, so he struck Israel. 8 David then said to the true God: \"I have sinned greatly by doing this. And now, please, forgive your servant's error, for I have acted very foolishly.\" 9 Jehovah then spoke to Gad, David's visionary, saying: 10 \"Go and say to David, 'This is what Jehovah says: \"I am giving you three options. Choose the one that I should bring on you.\"'\" 11 So Gad came in to David and said to him: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'Take your pick 12 whether there should be three years of famine, or three months of being swept away by your adversaries while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of Jehovah-pestilence in the land-with Jehovah's angel bringing destruction in all the territory of Israel.' Now consider what I should reply to the One who sent me.\" 13 So David said to Gad: \"It is very distressing to me. Please, let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.\"\n14 Then Jehovah sent a pestilence on Israel, so that 70,000 people out of Israel fell. 15 Moreover, the true God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was about to do so, Jehovah saw it and felt regret over the calamity, and he said to the angel bringing destruction: \"It is enough! Now let your hand drop.\" Jehovah's angel was standing close to the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n16 When David raised his eyes, he saw Jehovah's angel standing between the earth and the heavens with a drawn sword in his hand extended toward Jerusalem. David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, at once threw themselves down with their faces to the ground. 17 David said to the true God: \"Was it not I who said to number the people? I am the one who sinned, and I am the one who did wrong; but these sheep-what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let your hand, please, come against me and my father's house; but do not bring this scourge on your people.\"\n18 Jehovah's angel then told Gad to tell David to go up and erect an altar to Jehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 19 So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah. 20 Meanwhile, Ornan turned around and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan had been threshing wheat. 21 When David came up to him, Ornan looked and saw David, and he immediately went out from the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the ground. 22 David said to Ornan: \"Sell me the site of the threshing floor, so that I may build an altar to Jehovah on it. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the scourge against the people may be halted.\" 23 But Ornan said to David: \"Take it as your own, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. Here, I am providing the cattle for burnt offerings and the threshing sledge for the wood and the wheat as a grain offering. I give all of it.\"\n24 However, King David said to Ornan: \"No, I must buy it for the full price, because I will not take what is yours and give it to Jehovah or offer up burnt sacrifices that cost me nothing.\" 25 So David gave Ornan 600 gold shekels by weight for the site. 26 And David built an altar there to Jehovah and offered up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices, and he called on Jehovah, who now answered him with fire from the heavens on the altar of burnt offering. 27 Then Jehovah ordered the angel to return his sword to its sheath. 28 At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he continued to sacrifice there. 29 However, the tabernacle of Jehovah that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon. 30 But David had not been able to go before it to consult God, for he was terrified because of the sword of Jehovah's angel.\nChapter 22\n1 David then said: \"This is the house of Jehovah the true God, and this is an altar for burnt offering for Israel.\"\n2 David then gave orders to bring together the foreign residents who were in the land of Israel, and he assigned them to be stonecutters to cut and shape stones for building the house of the true God. 3 David also prepared iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, and so much copper that it was beyond weighing, 4 and also cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar timbers to David. 5 And David said: \"My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for Jehovah is to be exceedingly magnificent, so that its fame and beauty will be known in all lands. Therefore, I will make preparation for him.\" So David prepared materials in great quantity before his death.\n6 Moreover, he summoned his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel. 7 David told his son Solomon: \"As for me, it was my heart's desire to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God. 8 But Jehovah's word came to me, saying, 'You have shed a great deal of blood, and you have fought great wars. You will not build a house for my name, for you have shed a great deal of blood on the earth before me. 9 Look! You will have a son who will be a man of peace, and I will give him rest from all his enemies who surround him, for Solomon will be his name and I will grant Israel peace and quiet in his days. 10 He is the one who will build a house for my name. He will become my son, and I will be his father. I will firmly establish the throne of his kingship over Israel forever.'\n11 \"Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you, and may you be successful and build the house of Jehovah your God, just as he has spoken concerning you. 12 Only may Jehovah give you discretion and understanding when he gives you authority over Israel, so that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God. 13 Then you will be successful if you carefully observe the regulations and the judgments that Jehovah ordered Moses to give Israel. Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or be terrified. 14 Here I have taken great pains to prepare for Jehovah's house 100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver and such great quantities of copper and iron that they cannot be weighed, and I have prepared timbers and stones, but you will add to them. 15 A great number of workmen are with you-stonecutters, stonemasons, woodworkers, and all kinds of skilled workers. 16 The gold, silver, copper, and iron are beyond measure. Get up and begin the work, and may Jehovah be with you.\"\n17 David then ordered all the princes of Israel to help his son Solomon: 18 \"Is not Jehovah your God with you, and has he not given you rest on every side? For he handed over to me the inhabitants of the land, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before his people. 19 Now determine with all your heart and soul to seek Jehovah your God, and start building the sanctuary of Jehovah the true God, in order to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy utensils of the true God to the house built for the name of Jehovah.\"\nChapter 23\n1 When David had grown old and was near the end of his life, he made his son Solomon king over Israel. 2 He then gathered all the princes of Israel, the priests, and the Levites. 3 The Levites who were 30 years old and up were numbered; their number, their head count man by man, was 38,000. 4 Of these, 24,000 served as supervisors over the work of Jehovah's house, and there were 6,000 officers and judges, 5 and there were 4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 gave praise to Jehovah on the instruments about which David said, \"I made them for giving praise.\"\n6 Then David organized them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 7 Of the Gershonites were Ladan and Shimei. 8 The sons of Ladan were Jehiel the headman, Zetham, and Joel, three. 9 The sons of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the paternal houses for Ladan. 10 And the sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 11 Jahath was the head and Zizah, the second. But since Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, they were counted as one paternal house with one area of responsibility.\n12 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 13 The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. But Aaron was permanently set apart to sanctify the Most Holy, he and his sons, to offer sacrifices before Jehovah, to minister to him, and to pronounce blessings in his name always. 14 As for Moses the man of the true God, his sons were named among the tribe of the Levites. 15 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer. 16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the head. 17 Of the descendants of Eliezer, Rehabiah was the head; Eliezer did not have other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 18 Of the sons of Izhar, Shelomith was the headman. 19 The sons of Hebron were Jeriah the head, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 20 The sons of Uzziel were Micah the head and Isshiah the second.\n21 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish. 22 Eleazar died, but he had no sons, only daughters. So the sons of Kish, their relatives, took them as wives. 23 The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.\n24 These were the sons of Levi according to their paternal houses, the heads of the paternal houses, by those registered who were counted and listed by their names and who carried out the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from 20 years old and up. 25 For David had said: \"Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to his people, and he will reside in Jerusalem forever. 26 Also the Levites will not have to carry the tabernacle or any of its equipment for its service.\" 27 For according to the last instructions of David, the Levites from 20 years old and up were numbered. 28 Their function was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, to be in charge of the courtyards, the dining rooms, the purification of every holy thing, and any work needed for the service of the house of the true God. 29 They assisted with the layer bread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the griddle cakes, the mixed dough, and all measures of quantity and size. 30 They were to stand morning by morning to thank and praise Jehovah and likewise in the evening. 31 They assisted whenever the burnt sacrifices were offered to Jehovah on the Sabbaths, the new moons, and during the festival seasons, according to the number required by the rules concerning them, doing so regularly before Jehovah. 32 They also took care of their responsibilities toward the tent of meeting, toward the holy place, and toward their brothers the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah.\nChapter 24\n1 Now the divisions of the descendants of Aaron were these: The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 2 However, Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they did not have any sons; but Eleazar and Ithamar continued to serve as priests. 3 David, along with Zadok from the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the sons of Ithamar, made divisions of them for the office of their service. 4 Since the sons of Eleazar had more headmen than the sons of Ithamar had, they divided them accordingly: The sons of Eleazar had 16 as heads of their paternal houses, and the sons of Ithamar had 8 as heads of their paternal houses.\n5 Further, they divided them by lots, the one group along with the other, for there were chiefs of the holy place and chiefs of the true God from both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar. 6 Then Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the secretary of the Levites recorded their names before the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the paternal houses of the priests and of the Levites, one paternal house being selected for Eleazar and one being selected for Ithamar.\n7 The first lot came out to Jehoiarib; the second to Jedaiah, 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 12 the 11th to Eliashib, the 12th to Jakim, 13 the 13th to Huppah, the 14th to Jeshebeab, 14 the 15th to Bilgah, the 16th to Immer, 15 the 17th to Hezir, the 18th to Happizzez, 16 the 19th to Pethahiah, the 20th to Jehezkel, 17 the 21st to Jachin, the 22nd to Gamul, 18 the 23rd to Delaiah, the 24th to Maaziah.\n19 These were their offices for their service when they would come into the house of Jehovah according to the procedure set by their forefather Aaron, just as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded him.\n20 And of the rest of the Levites: of the sons of Amram, there was Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah; 21 of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the head; 22 of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath; 23 and of the sons of Hebron, Jeriah the head, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth; 24 of the sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. 25 The brother of Micah was Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.\n26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi; of the sons of Jaaziah, Beno. 27 The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri; 28 of Mahli, Eleazar, who did not have any sons; 29 of Kish: the sons of Kish, Jerahmeel; 30 and the sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.\nThese were the sons of Levi by their paternal houses. 31 And they also cast lots just as their brothers the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the paternal houses of the priests and of the Levites. Regarding the paternal houses, the head one was just as his younger brother.\nChapter 25\n1 Further, David and the chiefs of the groups for the service separated some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to serve by prophesying with the harps, the stringed instruments, and the cymbals. The list of the official men for this service was, 2 of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king. 3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the harp, thanking and praising Jehovah. 4 Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 5 All of these were sons of Heman, a visionary of the king in matters pertaining to the true God to his glory; thus the true God gave Heman 14 sons and 3 daughters. 6 All of these were under the direction of their father for singing at the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps for the service of the house of the true God.\nUnder the king's direction were Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.\n7 The number of them and their brothers who were trained in song to Jehovah, all experts, was 288. 8 So they cast lots for their duties, the small and the great alike, the expert along with the learner.\n9 The first lot to come out belonged to Asaph for Joseph, the second for Gedaliah (he and his brothers and his sons were 12); 10 the third for Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, 12; 11 the fourth for Izri, his sons and his brothers, 12; 12 the fifth for Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 13 the sixth for Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 14 the seventh for Jesharelah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 15 the eighth for Jeshaiah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 16 the ninth for Mattaniah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 17 the tenth for Shimei, his sons and his brothers, 12; 18 the 11th for Azarel, his sons and his brothers, 12; 19 the 12th for Hashabiah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 20 for the 13th, Shubael, his sons and his brothers, 12; 21 for the 14th, Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 22 for the 15th, for Jeremoth, his sons and his brothers, 12; 23 for the 16th, for Hananiah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 24 for the 17th, for Joshbekashah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 25 for the 18th, for Hanani, his sons and his brothers, 12; 26 for the 19th, for Mallothi, his sons and his brothers, 12; 27 for the 20th, for Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 28 for the 21st, for Hothir, his sons and his brothers, 12; 29 for the 22nd, for Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, 12; 30 for the 23rd, for Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, 12; 31 for the 24th, for Romamti-ezer, his sons and his brothers, 12.\nChapter 26\n1 The divisions of gatekeepers were as follows: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore of the sons of Asaph. 2 And Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, 3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elieho-enai the seventh. 4 And Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for God had blessed him.\n6 And to his son Shemaiah, there were sons born who were rulers of their paternal house, for they were mighty, capable men. 7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; and his brothers Elihu and Semachiah were also capable men. 8 All of these were of the sons of Obed-edom; they and their sons and their brothers were capable men and qualified for the service, 62 belonging to Obed-edom. 9 And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, 18 capable men. 10 And Hosah of the sons of Merari had sons. Shimri was the head, for although he was not the firstborn, his father appointed him as head, 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were 13.\n12 Of these divisions of the gatekeepers, the headmen had duties just as their brothers did, to minister at the house of Jehovah. 13 So they cast lots, the small and the great alike by their paternal houses, for the different gates. 14 Then the lot to the east fell to Shelemiah. For Zechariah his son, a discreet adviser, they cast the lots, and his lot came out to the north. 15 Obed-edom had his to the south, and his sons were assigned the storehouses. 16 Shuppim and Hosah had theirs to the west, near the Shallecheth Gate by the highway that goes up, guard group corresponding to guard group; 17 there were six Levites to the east; to the north, four each day and to the south, four each day; and for the storehouses, two by two; 18 for the portico to the west, there were four at the highway and two at the portico. 19 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of the Korahites and of the Merarites.\n20 As regards the Levites, Ahijah was in charge of the treasuries of the house of the true God and the treasuries of the things made holy. 21 The sons of Ladan: the sons of the Gershonite belonging to Ladan, the heads of the paternal houses belonging to Ladan the Gershonite, Jehieli 22 and the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the house of Jehovah. 23 From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites, 24 Shebuel son of Gershom son of Moses was a leader in charge of the storehouses. 25 As regards his brothers, of Eliezer, there was Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 26 This Shelomoth and his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries of the things made holy, which King David, the heads of the paternal houses, the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, and the chiefs of the army had made holy. 27 From the wars and from the spoil, they had made things holy to maintain the house of Jehovah; 28 also, all that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had made holy. Whatever anyone made holy was put in the care of Shelomith and his brothers.\n29 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were assigned outside administrative duties as officers and as judges over Israel.\n30 Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, 1,700 capable men, were over the administration of Israel in the region west of the Jordan for all the work of Jehovah and for the king's service. 31 Of the Hebronites, Jerijah was the head of the Hebronites by line of descent of their paternal house. In the 40th year of David's kingship, they were sought out, and mighty, capable men were found among them in Jazer in Gilead. 32 And his brothers numbered 2,700 capable men, heads of the paternal houses. So King David assigned them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of the Manassites, for every matter of the true God and matter of the king.\nChapter 27\n1 This is the number of Israelites, the heads of the paternal houses, the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, and their officers who ministered to the king in every matter of the divisions that would come in and go out month by month during all the months of the year; there were 24,000 in each division.\n2 Over the first division of the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel, and 24,000 were in his division. 3 Of the sons of Perez, he was the head of all the chiefs of the groups assigned to serve during the first month. 4 Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite with his division, and Mikloth was the leader, and 24,000 were in his division. 5 The chief of the third group assigned to serve during the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the chief priest, and 24,000 were in his division. 6 This Benaiah was a mighty warrior of the thirty and in charge of the thirty, and over his division was his son Ammizabad. 7 The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel, Joab's brother, and his son Zebadiah after him, and 24,000 were in his division. 8 The fifth chief for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite, and 24,000 were in his division. 9 The sixth for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, and 24,000 were in his division. 10 The seventh for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite of the Ephraimites, and 24,000 were in his division. 11 The eighth for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite of the Zerahites, and 24,000 were in his division. 12 The ninth for the ninth month was Abi-ezer the Anathothite of the Benjaminites, and 24,000 were in his division. 13 The tenth for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite of the Zerahites, and 24,000 were in his division. 14 The 11th for the 11th month was Benaiah the Pirathonite of the sons of Ephraim, and 24,000 were in his division. 15 The 12th for the 12th month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel, and 24,000 were in his division.\n16 These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel: Of the Reubenites, Eliezer the son of Zichri was leader; of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah; 17 of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok; 18 of Judah, Elihu, one of David's brothers; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael; 19 of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel; 20 of the Ephraimites, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah; 21 of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner; 22 of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.\n23 David did not count those 20 years of age and under, because Jehovah had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of the heavens. 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah had started to take the count, but he did not finish; and God's anger came against Israel because of this, and the number was not entered into the account of the history of the times of King David.\n25 Over the treasuries of the king was Azmaveth the son of Adiel. Jonathan the son of Uzziah was over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers. 26 Over the field workers who cultivated the soil was Ezri the son of Chelub. 27 Shimei the Ramathite was over the vineyards; over the produce of the vineyards for the wine supplies was Zabdi the Shiphmite. 28 Over the olive groves and the sycamore trees in the Shephelah was Baal-hanan the Gederite; over the oil supplies was Joash. 29 Over the herds that grazed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite, and Shaphat the son of Adlai was over the herds in the valley plains. 30 Over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite; over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite. 31 Over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. All of these were the chiefs of King David's property.\n32 Jonathan, David's nephew, was an adviser, a man of understanding and a secretary, and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni looked after the king's sons. 33 Ahithophel was an adviser to the king, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend. 34 After Ahithophel there were Jehoiada the son of Benaiah and Abiathar; and Joab was chief of the king's army.\nChapter 28\n1 David then congregated all the princes of Israel to Jerusalem: the princes of the tribes, the chiefs of the divisions ministering to the king, the chiefs of thousands and the chiefs of hundreds, the chiefs of all the property and livestock of the king and of his sons, together with the court officials and every mighty and capable man. 2 Then King David rose to his feet and said:\n\"Hear me, my brothers and my people. It was my heart's desire to build a house as the resting-place for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and as the footstool of our God, and I made preparations to build. 3 But the true God told me, 'You will not build a house for my name, for you are a man of wars, and you have shed blood.' 4 However, Jehovah the God of Israel chose me out of all the house of my father to become king over Israel forever, for he chose Judah as leader and of the house of Judah, my father's house, and of my father's sons, I was the one whom he approved, to make me king over all Israel. 5 And of all my sons-for Jehovah has given me many sons-he chose my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingship of Jehovah over Israel.\n6 \"He said to me, 'Your son Solomon is the one who will build my house and my courtyards, for I have chosen him as my son and I will become his father. 7 I will firmly establish his kingship forever if he resolutely observes my commandments and my judicial decisions, as he is now doing.' 8 So I say before the eyes of all Israel, Jehovah's congregation, and in the ears of our God: Carefully observe and search for all the commandments of Jehovah your God, so that you may possess the good land and pass it on as a permanent inheritance to your sons after you.\n9 \"And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul, for Jehovah searches through all hearts, and he discerns every inclination of the thoughts. If you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him, he will reject you forever. 10 See, now, for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house as a sanctuary. Be courageous and go to work.\"\n11 David then gave to his son Solomon the architectural plan of the porch and of its houses, its storerooms, its roof chambers, its inner rooms, and the house of the propitiatory cover. 12 He gave him the architectural plan of everything that had been conveyed to him through inspiration for the courtyards of Jehovah's house, for all the dining rooms around it, for the treasuries of the house of the true God, and for the treasuries of the things made holy; 13 also for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, for all the duties of the service of Jehovah's house, and for all the utensils of the service of Jehovah's house; 14 also for the weight of the gold, the gold for all the utensils for the different services, the weight of all the utensils of silver, and for all the utensils for the different services; 15 also the weight for the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, the weight of the different lampstands and their lamps, and the weight of the silver lampstands, for each lampstand and its lamps according to its use; 16 also the weight of the gold for the tables of the layer bread, for each table, as well as the silver for the tables of silver, 17 for the forks, the bowls, the pitchers of pure gold, and the weight of the small gold bowls, for each small bowl, and the weight of the small silver bowls, for each small bowl. 18 He also gave the weight for the refined gold for the incense altar and for the representation of the chariot, namely, the cherubs of gold that spread their wings out and overshadow the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. 19 David said: \"The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he gave me insight to put all the details of the architectural plan in writing.\"\n20 Then David said to his son Solomon: \"Be courageous and strong and go to work. Do not be afraid or be terrified, for Jehovah God, my God, is with you. He will not desert you or abandon you, but he will be with you until all the work for the service of Jehovah's house is finished. 21 And here are the divisions of the priests and of the Levites for all the service of the house of the true God. You have willing, skilled workers to perform every kind of service, as well as the princes and all the people who will carry out all your instructions.\"\nChapter 29\n1 King David now said to all the congregation: \"My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for it is not a temple for man but for Jehovah God. 2 And I have spared no effort to prepare for the house of my God, providing the gold for the goldwork, the silver for the silverwork, the copper for the copperwork, the iron for the ironwork, the timbers for the timberwork, onyx stones, and stones to be set with mortar, mosaic pebbles, every kind of precious stone, and alabaster stones in great quantity. 3 Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, there is also my private treasure of gold and silver that I am giving to the house of my God, in addition to all that I have prepared for the holy house, 4 including 3,000 talents of gold from Ophir and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for coating the walls of the houses, 5 the gold for the goldwork and the silver for the silverwork, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who volunteers to come forward today with a gift in hand for Jehovah?\"\n6 So the princes of the paternal houses, the princes of the tribes of Israel, the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, and the chiefs of the business of the king came forward voluntarily. 7 And they gave to the service of the house of the true God: 5,000 talents of gold, 10,000 darics, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of copper, and 100,000 talents of iron. 8 Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9 The people rejoiced over making these voluntary offerings, for they made the voluntary offerings to Jehovah with a complete heart, and David the king also rejoiced greatly.\n10 Then David praised Jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation. David said: \"May you be praised, O Jehovah the God of Israel our father, throughout all eternity. 11 Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah. You are the One exalting yourself as head over all. 12 The riches and the glory are from you, and you rule over everything, and in your hand there are power and mightiness, and your hand is able to make great and to give strength to all. 13 And now, O our God, we thank you and praise your beautiful name.\n14 \"And yet, who am I and who are my people that we should be in a position to make voluntary offerings like this? For everything is from you, and we have given to you what comes from your own hand. 15 For we are foreign residents in your presence and settlers, just like all our forefathers. For our days on the earth are like a shadow-without hope. 16 O Jehovah our God, all this wealth that we have prepared to build for you a house for your holy name is from your own hand, and it all belongs to you. 17 I well know, O my God, that you examine the heart and that you take pleasure in integrity. In the uprightness of my heart, I have voluntarily offered all these things, and I am overjoyed to see your people who are present here make voluntary offerings to you. 18 O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our forefathers, keep these inclinations and thoughts in the hearts of your people forever, and direct their hearts to you. 19 And give a complete heart to my son Solomon, so that he may observe your commandments, your reminders, and your regulations and do all these things and build the temple for which I have made preparation.\"\n20 David then said to all the congregation: \"Now praise Jehovah your God.\" And all the congregation praised Jehovah the God of their forefathers and bowed low and prostrated themselves to Jehovah and to the king. 21 And they continued to offer sacrifices to Jehovah and to offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the following day, 1,000 young bulls, 1,000 rams, 1,000 male lambs, and their drink offerings; they offered sacrifices in great number for all Israel. 22 They continued eating and drinking before Jehovah on that day with great rejoicing, and for a second time they made Solomon the son of David king and anointed him before Jehovah as leader, and also Zadok as priest. 23 And Solomon sat on Jehovah's throne as king in place of David his father, and he was successful, and all the Israelites were obedient to him. 24 All the princes, the mighty warriors, and also all the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. 25 And Jehovah made Solomon exceedingly great before the eyes of all Israel and bestowed on him royal majesty such as no king over Israel ever had before.\n26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel, 27 and the length of his reign over Israel was 40 years. In Hebron he reigned for 7 years, and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years. 28 And he died at a good old age, satisfied with long life, wealth, and glory; and his son Solomon became king in his place. 29 As for the history of King David, from beginning to end, it is written among the words of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the visionary, 30 together with all his kingship, his mightiness, and the events of the times involving him and Israel and all the surrounding kingdoms. \n",

    "text": "Second Chronicles\nChapter 1\n1 Solomon the son of David grew ever stronger in his kingship, and Jehovah his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.\n2 Solomon sent for all Israel, the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, the judges, and all the chieftains of all Israel, the heads of the paternal houses. 3 Then Solomon and all the congregation went to the high place at Gibeon, for that was where the tent of meeting of the true God was, which tent Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness. 4 However, David had brought the Ark of the true God up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 5 And the copper altar that Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made had been put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the congregation would pray before it. 6 Solomon now made offerings there before Jehovah, and he offered up 1,000 burnt offerings on the copper altar of the tent of meeting.\n7 That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him: \"Ask what you would like me to give you.\" 8 At this Solomon said to God: \"You have shown great loyal love toward my father David, and you have made me king in his place. 9 Now, O Jehovah God, let your promise to David my father prove faithful, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust particles of the earth. 10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge to lead this people, for who can possibly judge this great people of yours?\"\n11 Then God said to Solomon: \"Because this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches, and honor or for the death of those hating you, nor have you asked for a long life, but you have asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge my people over whom I have made you king, 12 wisdom and knowledge will be given you; but I will also give you wealth and riches and honor such as no kings before you have had and none after you will have.\"\n13 So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. 14 Solomon kept accumulating chariots and horses; he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem. 15 The king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones, and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the Shephelah. 16 The horses of Solomon had been imported from Egypt, and the company of the king's merchants would obtain the horses in droves for one price. 17 Each chariot imported from Egypt cost 600 silver pieces, and a horse cost 150; in turn, they would export them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.\nChapter 2\n1 Solomon now gave the order to build a house for Jehovah's name and a house for his kingdom. 2 Solomon enlisted 70,000 men as common laborers, 80,000 men as stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 as overseers over them. 3 Further, Solomon sent word to Hiram the king of Tyre: \"Do for me as you did for David my father when you sent him cedarwood to build a house to live in. 4 Now I am building a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to sanctify it to him, to burn perfumed incense before him, and also for the constant layer bread and the burnt offerings, morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and at the festival seasons of Jehovah our God. This is a lasting obligation for Israel. 5 The house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all the other gods. 6 And who is up to the task of building him a house? For the heavens and the heaven of the heavens cannot contain him, so who am I that I should build him a house except as a place for making sacrifices smoke before him? 7 Now send me a craftsman who is skilled in working in gold, silver, copper, iron, purple wool, crimson, and blue thread and who knows how to cut engravings. He will work in Judah and in Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen, whom David my father has provided. 8 And send me timbers of cedar, juniper, and algum from Lebanon, for I well know that your servants are experienced at cutting down the trees of Lebanon. My servants will work along with your servants 9 to prepare for me great quantities of timber, for the house that I am to build will be extraordinarily great. 10 Now look! I will supply the food for your servants, the woodcutters who cut down the trees: 20,000 cors of wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.\"\n11 At that Hiram the king of Tyre sent this written message to Solomon: \"Because Jehovah loves his people, he has made you their king.\" 12 Hiram then said: \"May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, who made the heavens and the earth, because he has given to King David a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom. 13 Now I am sending a skilled craftsman, endowed with understanding, Hiram-abi, 14 who is the son of a Danite woman but whose father was a man of Tyre; he has experience in working in gold, silver, copper, iron, stones, timbers, purple wool, blue thread, fine fabric, and crimson. He can do every sort of engraving and make any design he is given. He will work with your own skilled craftsmen and the skilled craftsmen of my lord David your father. 15 Now let my lord send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine he has promised to his servants. 16 And we will cut down trees from Lebanon, as many as you need, and we will bring them to you as rafts by sea to Joppa; and you will take them up to Jerusalem.\"\n17 Solomon then took a count of all the men who were foreign residents in the land of Israel, after the census taken by David his father, and there were found 153,600. 18 So he assigned 70,000 of them as common laborers, 80,000 as stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 as overseers for putting the people to work.\nChapter 3\n1 Then Solomon started to build the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Jehovah had appeared to his father David, in the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 2 He started to build on the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 3 And the foundation that Solomon laid for building the house of the true God was 60 cubits long and 20 cubits wide, according to the former measurement. 4 The porch in front was 20 cubits long, corresponding to the width of the house, and its height was 20 cubits; and he overlaid it inside with pure gold. 5 He paneled the great house with juniper wood, after which he covered it with fine gold, and then he decorated it with palm-tree figures and chains. 6 Further, he overlaid the house with beautiful precious stones; and the gold he used was gold from Parvaim. 7 He covered the house, the rafters, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold; and he engraved cherubs on the walls.\n8 He now made the Most Holy compartment; its length matched the width of the house, 20 cubits, and its width was 20 cubits. He covered it with 600 talents of fine gold. 9 The weight of the gold for the nails was 50 shekels; and he covered the roof chambers with gold.\n10 Then he made in the Most Holy compartment two cherub sculptures, and he overlaid them with gold. 11 The overall length of the wings of the cherubs was 20 cubits; one wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the house, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the other cherub's wings. 12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits long and touched the other wall of the house, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the first cherub's wings. 13 The wings of these cherubs were spread out 20 cubits; and they stood on their feet, and they faced inward.\n14 He also made the curtain of blue thread, purple wool, crimson, and fine fabric, and incorporated cherub designs into it.\n15 Then he made two pillars at the front of the house, 35 cubits in length, and the capital on top of each pillar was five cubits. 16 And he made chains, like necklaces, and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made 100 pomegranates and put them on the chains. 17 He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one to the right and one to the left; he named the one on the right Jachin and the one on the left Boaz.\nChapter 4\n1 Then he made the copper altar, 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits high.\n2 He made the Sea of cast metal. It was circular in shape, 10 cubits from brim to brim and 5 cubits high, and it took a measuring line 30 cubits long to encircle it. 3 And there were ornamental gourds under it, completely encircling it, ten to a cubit all around the Sea. The gourds were in two rows and were cast in one piece with it. 4 It stood on 12 bulls, 3 facing north, 3 facing west, 3 facing south, and 3 facing east; and the Sea rested on them, and all their hindquarters were toward the center. 5 And its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. The reservoir could hold 3,000 bath measures.\n6 Further, he made ten basins for washing and put five to the right and five to the left. They would rinse in them the things used for the burnt offering. But the Sea was for the priests for washing.\n7 He then made ten lampstands of gold, as specified, and put them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left.\n8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left; and he made 100 golden bowls.\n9 Then he made the courtyard of the priests and the great court and the doors for the court, and he overlaid their doors with copper. 10 And he placed the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast.\n11 Hiram also made the cans, the shovels, and the bowls.\nSo Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the true God: 12 the two pillars and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars; 13 the 400 pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the pillars; 14 the ten carriages and the ten basins on the carriages; 15 the Sea and the 12 bulls beneath it; 16 and the cans, the shovels, the forks, and all their utensils Hiram-abiv made of polished copper for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah. 17 The king cast them in the district of the Jordan in the thick clay between Succoth and Zeredah. 18 Solomon made all these utensils in great quantities; the weight of the copper was not ascertained.\n19 Solomon made all the utensils for the house of the true God: the altar of gold; the tables with the showbread on them; 20 the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold, to burn before the innermost room according to the requirements; 21 and the blossoms, the lamps, and the snuffers, of gold, the purest gold; 22 the extinguishers, the bowls, the cups, and the fire holders, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the Most Holy, and the doors of the house of the temple, of gold.\nChapter 5\n1 So Solomon completed all the work he had to do for the house of Jehovah. Solomon then brought in the things that David his father had made holy, and he put the silver, the gold, and all the articles into the treasuries of the house of the true God. 2 At that time Solomon congregated the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, the chieftains of the paternal houses of Israel. They came to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, that is, Zion. 3 All the men of Israel assembled before the king at the festival that is held in the seventh month.\n4 So all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites lifted up the Ark. 5 They brought up the Ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up. 6 King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel who had been summoned to meet with him were before the Ark. So many sheep and cattle were being sacrificed that they could not be counted or numbered. 7 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the innermost room of the house, the Most Holy, underneath the wings of the cherubs. 8 Thus the wings of the cherubs were spread out over the place of the Ark, so that the cherubs covered over the Ark and its poles from above. 9 The poles were so long that the tips of the poles were visible from the Holy in front of the innermost room, but they were not visible from outside. And they are there to this day. 10 There was nothing in the Ark but the two tablets that Moses placed in it at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the people of Israel while they were coming out of Egypt.\n11 When the priests came out from the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, regardless of their divisions), 12 all the Levite singers who belonged to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons and their brothers were clothed in fine fabric, holding cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps; they were standing east of the altar, and along with them 120 priests were sounding the trumpets. 13 At the moment when the trumpeters and the singers were praising and thanking Jehovah in unison, and as the sound ascended from the trumpets, the cymbals, and the other musical instruments as they were praising Jehovah, \"for he is good; his loyal love endures forever,\" then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud. 14 The priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of the true God.\nChapter 6\n1 At that time Solomon said: \"Jehovah said he would reside in the thick gloom. 2 Now I have built a lofty house for you, an established place for you to dwell in forever.\"\n3 Then the king turned around and began to bless all the congregation of Israel while all the congregation of Israel stood. 4 He said: \"May Jehovah the God of Israel be praised, the one who by his own mouth promised my father David and by his own hands has given fulfillment, saying, 5 'From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house for my name to remain there, and I have not chosen a man to become leader over my people Israel. 6 But I have chosen Jerusalem for my name to remain there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.' 7 And it was the heart's desire of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel. 8 But Jehovah said to my father David, 'It was your heart's desire to build a house for my name, and you did well to desire this in your heart. 9 However, you will not build the house, but your own son who is to be born to you is the one who will build the house for my name.' 10 Jehovah has carried out the promise that he made, for I have succeeded my father David and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Jehovah promised. I have also built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, 11 and there I have placed the Ark containing the covenant that Jehovah made with the people of Israel.\"\n12 Then he stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the congregation of Israel, and he spread out his hands. 13 (For Solomon had made a platform of copper and put it in the middle of the court. It was five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high; and he stood on it.) And he knelt down in front of all the congregation of Israel and spread his hands out to the heavens, 14 and he said: \"O Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heavens or on the earth, keeping the covenant and showing loyal love to your servants who are walking before you with all their heart. 15 You have kept the promise that you made to your servant David my father. You made the promise with your own mouth, and this day you have fulfilled it with your own hand. 16 And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, keep the promise you made to your servant David my father when you said: 'There will never fail to be a man of your line before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons will pay attention to their way by walking in my law, just as you have walked before me.' 17 And now, O Jehovah the God of Israel, let the promise that you made to your servant David prove trustworthy.\n18 \"But will God really dwell with mankind on the earth? Look! The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built! 19 Now pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request for favor, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry for help and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you. 20 May your eyes be open toward this house day and night, toward the place where you said that you would put your name, to listen to the prayer that your servant prays toward this place. 21 And listen to your servant's pleas for help and to the pleas of your people Israel when they pray toward this place, and may you hear from your dwelling place, from the heavens; yes, may you hear and forgive.\n22 \"If a man sins against his fellow man and is made to take an oath and is brought under liability to the oath, and while under the oath he comes before your altar in this house, 23 may you then hear from the heavens and act and judge your servants by paying back the wicked one and bringing what he did on his own head and by pronouncing the righteous one innocent and rewarding him according to his own righteousness.\n24 \"And if your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they kept sinning against you, and they return and glorify your name and pray and beg for favor before you in this house, 25 may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their forefathers.\n26 \"When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they kept sinning against you, and they pray toward this place and glorify your name and turn back from their sin because you humbled them, 27 may you then hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants, of your people Israel, for you will instruct them about the good way in which they should walk; and bring rain on your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance.\n28 \"If a famine occurs in the land, or a pestilence, a scorching blight, mildew, swarming locusts, or voracious locusts or if their enemies besiege them in any of the cities of the land or if any other sort of plague or disease occurs, 29 whatever prayer, whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people Israel (for each one knows his own plague and his own pain) when they spread out their hands toward this house, 30 then may you hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and may you forgive; and reward each one according to all his ways, for you know his heart (you alone truly know the human heart), 31 so that they may fear you by walking in your ways all the days they live on the land that you gave to our forefathers.\n32 \"Also concerning the foreigner who is not part of your people Israel and who comes from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, and he comes and prays toward this house, 33 may you then listen from the heavens, your dwelling place, and do all that the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as your people Israel do, and may know that your name has been called on this house that I have built.\n34 \"If your people go to war against their enemies in the way that you send them and they pray to you in the direction of this city that you have chosen and toward the house that I have built for your name, 35 then hear from the heavens their prayer and their request for favor and execute judgment for them.\n36 \"If they sin against you (for there is no man who does not sin), and you are furious with them and you abandon them to an enemy, and their captors carry them off captive to a land, far or near, 37 and they come to their senses in the land where they were carried off captive, and they return to you and beg you for favor in the land where they are captives, saying, 'We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,' 38 and they return to you with all their heart and all their soul in the land of their captivity where they were carried off captive, and they pray in the direction of their land that you gave to their forefathers and the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name, 39 then hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, their prayer and their request for favor, and execute judgment for them and forgive your people who have sinned against you.\n40 \"Now, O my God, please, may your eyes be opened and your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place. 41 And now go up, O Jehovah God, to your resting-place, you and the Ark of your strength. Let your priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let your loyal ones rejoice in your goodness. 42 O Jehovah God, do not reject your anointed one. May you remember your loyal love to David your servant.\"\nChapter 7\n1 Now as soon as Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and Jehovah's glory filled the house. 2 The priests were unable to enter the house of Jehovah because Jehovah's glory had filled the house of Jehovah. 3 And all the people of Israel were looking on when the fire came down and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house, and they bowed low with their faces to the ground on the pavement and prostrated themselves and thanked Jehovah, \"for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.\"\n4 Now the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Jehovah. 5 King Solomon offered the sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep. Thus the king and all the people inaugurated the house of the true God. 6 The priests were standing at their posts of duty, as were the Levites who had the instruments used to accompany the song to Jehovah. (King David had made these instruments for giving thanks to Jehovah-\"for his loyal love endures forever\"-when David would offer praise with them.) And the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets in front of them, while all the Israelites were standing.\n7 Then Solomon sanctified the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of Jehovah, for there he had to offer up the burnt offerings and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices, because the copper altar that Solomon had made could not contain the burnt sacrifices, the grain offerings, and the fat pieces. 8 At that time Solomon held the festival for seven days together with all Israel, a very great congregation from Lebo-hamath down to the Wadi of Egypt. 9 But on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, because they had held the inauguration of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days. 10 Then on the 23rd day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their homes rejoicing and feeling glad of heart over the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David and Solomon and Israel his people.\n11 Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah and the house of the king; and everything that came into Solomon's heart to do regarding the house of Jehovah and his own house he accomplished successfully. 12 Jehovah then appeared to Solomon during the night and said to him: \"I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. 13 When I shut up the heavens and there is no rain and when I command the grasshoppers to devour the land and if I send a pestilence among my people, 14 if my people on whom my name has been called humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn away from their evil ways, then I will hear from the heavens and forgive their sin and heal their land. 15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayer at this place. 16 And now I have chosen and sanctified this house so that my name may be there permanently, and my eyes and my heart will always be there.\n17 \"And you, if you walk before me as your father David walked by doing everything I have commanded you, and you obey my regulations and my judgments, 18 then I will establish the throne of your kingship, just as I made a covenant with your father David, saying, 'There will never fail to be a man of your line ruling over Israel.' 19 But if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have put before you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, 20 I will uproot Israel from my land that I have given them, and this house that I have sanctified for my name I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it an object of scorn and a cause for ridicule among all the peoples. 21 And this house will become heaps of ruins. Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement and will say, 'Why did Jehovah do that to this land and this house?' 22 Then they will say, 'It was because they abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they embraced other gods and bowed down to them and served them. That is why he brought all this calamity on them.'\"\nChapter 8\n1 At the end of 20 years, during which Solomon built the house of Jehovah and his own house, 2 Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given Solomon and settled Israelites there. 3 Furthermore, Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it. 4 Then he built up Tadmor in the wilderness and all the storage cities that he had built in Hamath. 5 He also built up Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, 6 and Baalath as well as all of Solomon's storage cities, all the chariot cities, the cities for the horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.\n7 As for all the people who were left from the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not part of Israel, 8 their descendants who were left in the land-those whom the Israelites had not exterminated-were conscripted by Solomon for forced labor until this day. 9 But Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his work, for they were his warriors, the chiefs of his adjutants, and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen. 10 There were 250 chiefs of the deputies of King Solomon, the foremen over the people.\n11 Solomon also brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said: \"Although she is my wife, she should not dwell in the house of King David of Israel, for the places to which the Ark of Jehovah has come are holy.\"\n12 Then Solomon offered up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he had built in front of the porch. 13 He followed the daily routine and made offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed festivals three times in the year-the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths. 14 Further, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their services according to the rule of his father David, and the Levites for their posts of duty, to praise and to minister in the presence of the priests according to the daily routine, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the different gates, for such was the commandment of David, the man of the true God. 15 And they did not deviate from the king's commandment to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the storehouses. 16 So Solomon's work was all well-organized, from the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.\n17 It was then that Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the seashore in the land of Edom. 18 Hiram sent him ships and experienced seamen by means of his own servants. They went with Solomon's servants to Ophir and took from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.\nChapter 9\n1 Now the queen of Sheba heard the report about Solomon, so she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with perplexing questions. She was accompanied by a very impressive entourage, with camels carrying balsam oil and great quantities of gold and precious stones. She went in to Solomon and spoke to him about everything that was close to her heart. 2 Solomon then answered all her questions. There was nothing too difficult for Solomon to explain to her.\n3 When the queen of Sheba had seen Solomon's wisdom, the house that he built, 4 the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the table service of his waiters and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and his burnt sacrifices that he regularly offered up at the house of Jehovah, she was left completely breathless. 5 So she said to the king: \"The report that I heard in my own land about your achievements and about your wisdom was true. 6 But I did not put faith in the reports until I had come and had seen it with my own eyes. And look! I had not been told the half of your great wisdom. You have far surpassed the report that I heard. 7 Happy are your men, and happy are your servants who stand before you constantly, listening to your wisdom! 8 May Jehovah your God be praised, who has taken pleasure in you by putting you on his throne as king for Jehovah your God. Because your God loves Israel, in order to make it continue forever, he appointed you over it as king to administer justice and righteousness.\"\n9 Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a great quantity of balsam oil and precious stones. Never again was such balsam oil brought in as what the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.\n10 Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum timbers and precious stones. 11 The king made from the algum timbers stairs for the house of Jehovah and for the king's house, as well as harps and stringed instruments for the singers. Nothing like them had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.\n12 King Solomon also gave the queen of Sheba whatever she desired and asked for, more than what she had brought to the king. Then she left and returned to her own land, together with her servants.\n13 And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year amounted to 666 talents of gold, 14 besides that brought in by the merchants and the traders and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land who were bringing gold and silver in to Solomon.\n15 King Solomon made 200 large shields of alloyed gold (600 shekels of alloyed gold went on each shield) 16 and 300 bucklers of alloyed gold (three minas of gold went on each buckler). Then the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.\n17 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 18 There were six steps to the throne, and there was a gold footstool attached to the throne, and there were armrests on both sides of the seat, and two lions were standing beside the armrests. 19 And there were 12 lions standing on the six steps, one at each end of the six steps. No other kingdom had made anything like it. 20 All the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. There was nothing made of silver, for silver was considered as nothing in the days of Solomon. 21 For the king's ships would go to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish would come loaded with gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.\n22 So King Solomon was greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 23 And the kings of all the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear his wisdom that the true God had put in his heart. 24 They would each bring a gift-articles of silver, articles of gold, garments, armor, balsam oil, horses, and mules-and this continued year after year. 25 And Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots and 12,000 horses, and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities and close by the king in Jerusalem. 26 And he ruled over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the boundary of Egypt. 27 The king made the silver in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones, and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the Shephelah. 28 And they would bring horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all the other lands.\n29 As for the rest of the history of Solomon, from beginning to end, is it not written among the words of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the record of visions of Iddo the visionary concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for 40 years. 31 Then Solomon was laid to rest with his forefathers. So they buried him in the City of David his father; and his son Rehoboam became king in his place.\nChapter 10\n1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2 As soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (he was still in Egypt because he had fled on account of King Solomon), Jeroboam came back from Egypt. 3 Then they sent for him, and Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said: 4 \"Your father made our yoke harsh. But if you make the harsh service of your father easier and you lighten the heavy yoke he put on us, we will serve you.\"\n5 At this he said to them: \"Return to me after three days.\" So the people went away. 6 King Rehoboam then consulted with the older men who had served his father Solomon while he was alive, saying: \"What advice would you give on how to reply to this people?\" 7 They answered him: \"If you are good to this people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.\"\n8 However, he rejected the advice that the older men gave him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and who were now his attendants. 9 He asked them: \"What advice do you offer on how we should reply to this people who have said to me, 'Make the yoke your father put on us lighter'?\" 10 The young men who had grown up with him said to him: \"This is what you should say to the people who have said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter for us'; this is what you should tell them, 'My little finger will be thicker than my father's hips. 11 My father imposed a heavy yoke on you, but I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.'\"\n12 Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had said: \"Return to me on the third day.\" 13 But the king answered them harshly. Thus King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men. 14 He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying: \"I will make your yoke heavier, and I will add to it. My father punished you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.\" 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was caused by the true God, in order to carry out the word that Jehovah had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\n16 As for all Israel, because the king refused to listen to them, the people replied to the king: \"What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each one to your gods, O Israel! Now look after your own house, O David.\" With that all Israel returned to their homes.\n17 But Rehoboam continued to reign over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.\n18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 19 And the Israelites have been in revolt against the house of David down to this day.\nChapter 11\n1 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he immediately congregated the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 trained warriors, to fight against Israel in order to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. 2 Then the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of the true God, saying: 3 \"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, 4 'This is what Jehovah says: \"You must not go up and fight against your brothers. Each of you return to his house, for I have caused this to happen.\"'\" So they obeyed the word of Jehovah and returned and did not go against Jeroboam.\n5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built fortified cities in Judah. 6 Thus he built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that were in Judah and Benjamin. 11 Further, he reinforced the fortified places and put commanders in them and supplied them with food and oil and wine, 12 and he supplied all the different cities with large shields and lances; he reinforced them to a very great degree. And Judah and Benjamin remained his.\n13 And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel took their stand with him, coming out of all their territories. 14 The Levites left their pastures and their possession and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had dismissed them from serving as priests to Jehovah. 15 Jeroboam then appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goatlike demons and for the calves that he had made. 16 And those from all the tribes of Israel who had their heart set on seeking Jehovah the God of Israel followed them to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their forefathers. 17 For three years they strengthened the kingship of Judah and supported Rehoboam the son of Solomon, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.\n18 Then Rehoboam took as his wife Mahalath the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab. 19 In time she bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 20 After her, he married Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom. In time she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 21 Rehoboam loved Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his other wives and concubines, for he took 18 wives and 60 concubines, and he became father to 28 sons and 60 daughters. 22 So Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as head and leader among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. 23 However, he acted with understanding and sent some of his sons to all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, to all the fortified cities, and gave them abundant provisions and acquired many wives for them.\nChapter 12\n1 Soon after the kingship of Rehoboam was firmly established and he had become strong, he abandoned the Law of Jehovah, and also all Israel with him. 2 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, for they had behaved unfaithfully toward Jehovah. 3 He had 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and countless troops who came with him from Egypt-Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians. 4 He captured the fortified cities of Judah and finally reached Jerusalem.\n5 Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'You have abandoned me, so I have also abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.'\" 6 At that the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said: \"Jehovah is righteous.\" 7 When Jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying: \"They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, and in a little while I will rescue them. I will not pour out my wrath on Jerusalem through Shishak. 8 But they will become his servants, so that they will know the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.\"\n9 So King Shishak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king's house. He took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made. 10 So King Rehoboam made copper shields to replace them, and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard, who guarded the entrance of the king's house. 11 Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah, the guards would come in and carry them, and then they would return them to the guard chamber. 12 Because the king humbled himself, Jehovah's anger turned away from him, and he did not destroy them completely. Moreover, there were some good things found in Judah.\n13 King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and continued to reign; Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name. The name of the king's mother was Naamah the Ammonitess. 14 But he did what was bad, for he had not resolved in his heart to search for Jehovah.\n15 As for Rehoboam's history, from beginning to end, is it not written among the words of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the visionary in the genealogical record? And there were constant wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. 16 Then Rehoboam was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the City of David; and his son Abijah became king in his place.\nChapter 13\n1 In the 18th year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. 2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.\n3 So Abijah went to war with an army of 400,000 mighty, trained warriors. And Jeroboam drew up in battle formation against him with 800,000 trained men, mighty warriors. 4 Abijah now stood on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the mountainous region of Ephraim, and said: \"Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel. 5 Do you not know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave to David a kingdom over Israel forever, to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? 6 But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of David's son Solomon, rose up and rebelled against his lord. 7 And idle, worthless men kept gathering to him. And they proved superior to Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and fainthearted, and he could not hold his own against them.\n8 \"And now you think you can hold your own against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David because you are a large crowd and you have the golden calves that Jeroboam made as gods for you. 9 Have you not driven out Jehovah's priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the Levites, and have you not appointed your own priests just like the peoples of the other lands? Anyone who came along with a young bull and seven rams could become a priest of what are not gods. 10 As for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not abandoned him; our priests, the descendants of Aaron, are ministering to Jehovah, and the Levites assist in the work. 11 They are making burnt offerings smoke to Jehovah each morning and each evening along with perfumed incense, and the layer bread is on the table of pure gold, and they light up the golden lampstand and its lamps each evening, because we are caring for our responsibility to Jehovah our God; but you have abandoned him. 12 Now look! the true God is with us, leading us, with his priests and the signal trumpets for sounding the battle alarm against you. O men of Israel, do not fight against Jehovah the God of your forefathers, for you will not be successful.\"\n13 But Jeroboam dispatched an ambush to come from behind them, so that they were in front of Judah and the ambush was behind them. 14 When the men of Judah turned around, they saw that they had to fight the battle both in front and from behind. So they began to cry out to Jehovah, while the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets. 15 The men of Judah broke out in a war cry, and when the men of Judah shouted the war cry, the true God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 16 The Israelites fled before Judah, and God gave them into their hand. 17 Abijah and his people inflicted a great slaughter on them, and the slain of Israel kept falling, 500,000 trained men. 18 Thus the men of Israel were humbled at that time, but the men of Judah proved superior because they relied on Jehovah the God of their forefathers. 19 Abijah kept chasing after Jeroboam and captured cities from him, Bethel and its dependent towns, Jeshanah and its dependent towns, and Ephrain and its dependent towns. 20 And Jeroboam never regained his power during the time of Abijah; then Jehovah struck him down and he died.\n21 But Abijah grew in strength. In time he took 14 wives, and he became father to 22 sons and 16 daughters. 22 And the rest of Abijah's history, his deeds and his words, is recorded in the writings of the prophet Iddo.\nChapter 14\n1 Then Abijah was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and his son Asa became king in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years.\n2 Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God. 3 He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the sacred poles. 4 Further, he told Judah to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers and to observe the Law and the commandment. 5 So he removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense stands, and under him, the kingdom continued without disturbance. 6 He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land had no disturbance and there was no war against him during these years, for Jehovah gave him rest. 7 He said to Judah: \"Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. For the land is still at our disposal, because we have searched for Jehovah our God. We have searched, and he has given us rest all around.\" So their building was successful.\n8 Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and lances. And out of Benjamin were 280,000 mighty warriors who carried bucklers and were armed with bows.\n9 Later Zerah the Ethiopian came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots. When he reached Mareshah, 10 Asa went out against him and they drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 11 Asa then called to Jehovah his God and said: \"O Jehovah, it does not matter to you whether those you help are many or have no power. Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we are relying on you, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man prevail against you.\"\n12 So Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. 13 Asa and the people with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and the Ethiopians continued falling until not one of them was alive, for they were crushed by Jehovah and by his army. Afterward they carried off a very great deal of spoil. 14 Further, they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of Jehovah had come upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was much to plunder in them. 15 They also attacked the tents of those with livestock, and they captured a great number of flocks and camels, after which they returned to Jerusalem.\nChapter 15\n1 Now the spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded. 2 So he went out to meet Asa and said to him: \"Hear me, O Asa and all Judah and Benjamin! Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him; and if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you. 3 For a long time Israel had been without the true God, without a priest teaching, and without law. 4 But when in their distress they returned to Jehovah the God of Israel and searched for him, he let himself be found by them. 5 In those times no one could travel safely, for there was much unrest among all the inhabitants of the lands. 6 Nation was being crushed by nation and one city by another city, because God kept them in disorder with every sort of distress. 7 But you, be strong and do not become discouraged, for your activity will be rewarded.\"\n8 As soon as Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the disgusting idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities that he had captured from the mountainous region of Ephraim, and he restored Jehovah's altar that was before the porch of Jehovah. 9 And he gathered together all Judah and Benjamin and the foreign residents with them from Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon, for they had deserted to him from Israel in great number when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him. 10 So they were gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month of the 15th year of Asa's reign. 11 On that day they sacrificed to Jehovah from the spoil they had brought, 700 cattle and 7,000 sheep. 12 Furthermore, they entered into a covenant to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers with all their heart and with all their soul. 13 Whoever would not search for Jehovah the God of Israel was to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman. 14 So they took an oath to Jehovah with a loud voice, with joyful shouting, and with the trumpets and horns. 15 And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had taken the oath with all their heart and they eagerly sought him and he let himself be found by them, and Jehovah continued to give them rest on every side.\n16 Asa the king even removed Maacah his grandmother from her position as queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole. Asa cut down her obscene idol and pulverized it and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 17 But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, Asa's heart was complete all his life. 18 And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of the true God-silver, gold, and various utensils. 19 There was no war until the 35th year of Asa's reign.\nChapter 16\n1 In the 36th year of the reign of Asa, King Baasha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up Ramah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah. 2 At that Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of Jehovah's house and the king's house and sent them to King Ben-hadad of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying: 3 \"There is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father. I am sending you silver and gold. Come, break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.\"\n4 Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they struck down Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the storage places of the cities of Naphtali. 5 When Baasha heard of it, he immediately quit building Ramah and abandoned his work on it. 6 King Asa then took all Judah, and they carried off the stones and timbers of Ramah that Baasha had been building with, and with them he built up Geba and Mizpah.\n7 At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and said to him: \"Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on Jehovah your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand. 8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a very great army with many chariots and horsemen? But because you relied on Jehovah, he gave them into your hand. 9 For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him. You have acted foolishly in this matter; from now on there will be wars against you.\"\n10 However, Asa became offended at the seer and put him in prison because he was enraged at him over this. And Asa began to mistreat others among the people at that same time. 11 Now the history of Asa, from beginning to end, is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel.\n12 In the 39th year of his reign, Asa developed an ailment in his feet until he became very sick; and even in his sickness, he turned, not to Jehovah, but to the healers. 13 Then Asa was laid to rest with his forefathers; he died in the 41st year of his reign. 14 So they buried him in the grand burial place that he had excavated for himself in the City of David, and they laid him on a bier that had been filled with balsam oil and different sorts of ingredients mixed into a specially made ointment. Further, they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning for him.\nChapter 17\n1 And his son Jehoshaphat became king in his place, and he strengthened his position over Israel. 2 He stationed military forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured. 3 Jehovah continued with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the former ways of his forefather David and did not search for the Baals. 4 For he searched for the God of his father and followed his commandment and not the practices of Israel. 5 Jehovah kept the kingdom firmly established in his hand; and all Judah continued to give gifts to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and glory in abundance. 6 His heart became bold in the ways of Jehovah, and he even removed the high places and the sacred poles from Judah.\n7 In the third year of his reign he sent for his princes, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 8 There were Levites with them: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, and along with them Elishama and Jehoram the priests. 9 They began teaching in Judah, taking with them the book of Jehovah's Law, and they went around through all the cities of Judah teaching among the people.\n10 And the dread of Jehovah came upon all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, and they did not fight against Jehoshaphat. 11 And the Philistines brought to Jehoshaphat gifts and money as tribute. The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats from their flocks.\n12 Jehoshaphat grew greater and greater, and he continued building fortified places and storage cities in Judah. 13 He carried out extensive projects in the cities of Judah, and he had soldiers, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem. 14 These were grouped by their paternal houses: of Judah the chiefs of thousands, Adnah the chief, and with him were 300,000 mighty warriors. 15 And under his command was Jehohanan the chief, and with him were 280,000. 16 And also under his command was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for Jehovah's service, and with him were 200,000 mighty warriors. 17 And out of Benjamin was Eliada, a mighty warrior, and with him were 200,000 men equipped with the bow and shield. 18 And under his command was Jehozabad, and with him were 180,000 men equipped for the army. 19 These were ministering to the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.\nChapter 18\n1 Jehoshaphat had riches and glory in abundance, but he made a marriage alliance with Ahab. 2 So years later he went down to Ahab at Samaria, and Ahab sacrificed sheep and cattle in abundance for him and for the people with him. And he urged him to go up against Ramoth-gilead. 3 Then King Ahab of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: \"Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?\" He replied to him: \"I am the same as you, and my people are the same as your people and will support you in the war.\"\n4 But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel: \"First inquire, please, for the word of Jehovah.\" 5 So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, 400 men, and said to them: \"Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?\" They said: \"Go up, and the true God will give it into the king's hand.\"\n6 Jehoshaphat then said: \"Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah? Let us also inquire through him.\" 7 At that the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: \"There is still one more man through whom we can inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good things concerning me, but always bad. He is Micaiah the son of Imlah.\" However, Jehoshaphat said: \"The king should not say such a thing.\"\n8 So the king of Israel called a court official and said: \"Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly.\" 9 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were each sitting on his throne, dressed in royal attire; they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 10 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself iron horns and said: \"This is what Jehovah says, 'With these you will gore the Syrians until you exterminate them.'\" 11 All the other prophets were prophesying the same way, saying: \"Go up to Ramoth-gilead and you will be successful; Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.\"\n12 So the messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him: \"Look! The words of the prophets are unanimously favorable to the king. Let your word, please, become like theirs, and speak favorably.\" 13 But Micaiah said: \"As surely as Jehovah is living, whatever my God says is what I will speak.\" 14 Then he came in to the king, and the king asked him: \"Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?\" At once he replied: \"Go up and you will be successful; they will be given into your hand.\" 15 At that the king said to him: \"How many times must I put you under oath not to speak to me anything but the truth in the name of Jehovah?\" 16 So he said: \"I see all the Israelites scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd. Jehovah said: 'These have no master. Let each one go back to his house in peace.'\"\n17 Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: \"Did I not tell you, 'He will not prophesy good things concerning me, only bad'?\"\n18 Micaiah then said: \"Therefore, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne and all the army of the heavens standing at his right and at his left. 19 Jehovah then said, 'Who will fool King Ahab of Israel, so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one was saying one thing while another said something else. 20 Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah and said, 'I will fool him.' Jehovah asked him, 'How will you do it?' 21 He replied, 'I will go out and become a deceptive spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' So he said, 'You will fool him, and what is more, you will be successful. Go out and do that.' 22 And now Jehovah has put a deceptive spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, but Jehovah has declared calamity for you.\"\n23 Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah now approached and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said: \"Which way did the spirit of Jehovah pass from me to speak with you?\" 24 Micaiah replied: \"Look! You will see which way on the day when you will enter the innermost room to hide.\" 25 Then the king of Israel said: \"Take Micaiah and turn him over to Amon the chief of the city and to Joash the king's son. 26 Tell them, 'This is what the king says: \"Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with a reduced allowance of bread and water until I return in peace.\"'\" 27 But Micaiah said: \"If you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken with me.\" Then he added: \"Take note, all you peoples.\"\n28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 29 The king of Israel now said to Jehoshaphat: \"I will disguise myself and will go into the battle, but you should put on your royal attire.\" So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they entered the battle. 30 Now the king of Syria had ordered his chariot commanders: \"Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.\" 31 And as soon as the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said to themselves: \"It is the king of Israel.\" So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat began to cry for help, and Jehovah helped him, and God at once diverted them from him. 32 When the chariot commanders saw that it was not the king of Israel, they immediately turned back from following him.\n33 But one man shot his bow at random, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail. So the king said to his charioteer: \"Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I have been badly wounded.\" 34 The fighting raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel had to be propped up in the chariot, facing the Syrians until the evening; and he died at sunset.\nChapter 19\n1 Then King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his own house in Jerusalem. 2 Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat: \"Is it the wicked you should be helping, and is it those who hate Jehovah you should love? Because of this the indignation of Jehovah is against you. 3 Nevertheless, there are good things that have been found in you, because you cleared out the sacred poles from the land and you have prepared your heart to search for the true God.\"\n4 Jehoshaphat continued living in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the mountainous region of Ephraim, to bring them back to Jehovah the God of their forefathers. 5 He also appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. 6 And he said to the judges: \"Pay attention to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah, and he is with you when you pass judgment. 7 Now let the fear of Jehovah be upon you. Be careful about what you do, for with Jehovah our God there is no injustice, no partiality, no bribe-taking.\"\n8 In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and the priests and some of the heads of the paternal houses of Israel to serve as judges for Jehovah and to settle legal cases for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 9 And he commanded them: \"This is what you should do in the fear of Jehovah, with faithfulness and a complete heart: 10 Whenever your brothers living in their cities bring a legal case that involves the shedding of blood or a question about a law, a commandment, regulations, or judgments, you should warn them so that they may not become guilty before Jehovah; otherwise his indignation will come against you and your brothers. This is what you should do, so that you may not incur guilt. 11 Here is Amariah the chief priest who is over you for every matter of Jehovah. Zebadiah the son of Ishmael is the leader of the house of Judah for every matter pertaining to the king. And the Levites will serve as officers for you. Be strong and act, and let Jehovah be with those who do what is good.\"\nChapter 20\n1 Afterward the Moabites and the Ammonites, together with some of the Ammonim, came to wage war against Jehoshaphat. 2 So Jehoshaphat was told: \"A large crowd has come against you from the region of the sea, from Edom, and there they are in Hazazon-tamar, that is, En-gedi.\" 3 At that Jehoshaphat became afraid, and he resolved to search for Jehovah. So he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. 4 The people of Judah then gathered together to inquire of Jehovah; they came from all the cities of Judah to consult Jehovah.\n5 Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Jehovah before the new courtyard, 6 and he said:\n\"O Jehovah the God of our forefathers, are you not God in the heavens; do you not have dominion over all the kingdoms of the nations? In your hand are power and might, and no one can stand against you. 7 O our God, did you not drive away the inhabitants of this land from before your people Israel and then give it as a lasting possession to the offspring of your friend Abraham? 8 And they settled in it, and they built for you there a sanctuary for your name, saying, 9 'If disaster should come on us, whether by sword, adverse judgment, pestilence, or famine, let us stand before this house and before you (for your name is in this house) and call to you for help out of our distress, and may you hear and save us.' 10 Now here are the men of Ammon, Moab, and the mountainous region of Seir, whom you did not allow Israel to invade when they came out of the land of Egypt. They turned away from them and did not annihilate them. 11 Now they are repaying us by coming in to drive us out from your possession that you gave us as an inheritance. 12 O our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us; and we do not know what we should do, but our eyes are toward you.\"\n13 Meanwhile, all those of Judah were standing before Jehovah, along with their little ones, their wives, and their children.\n14 Then in the middle of the congregation, the spirit of Jehovah came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah son of Benaiah son of Jeiel son of Mattaniah the Levite of the sons of Asaph. 15 He said: \"Pay attention, all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat! Here is what Jehovah says to you, 'Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd, for the battle is not yours but God's. 16 Tomorrow go down against them. They will be coming up by the pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of Jeruel. 17 You will not need to fight this battle. Take your position, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf. O Judah and Jerusalem, do not be afraid or be terrified. Tomorrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.'\"\n18 At once Jehoshaphat bowed low with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah to worship Jehovah. 19 Then the Levites who were descendants of the Kohathites and the Korahites rose up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with a very loud voice.\n20 They rose up early the next morning and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood up and said: \"Listen to me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Put faith in Jehovah your God so that you may be able to stand firm. Put faith in his prophets, and you will be successful.\"\n21 After he consulted with the people, he appointed men to sing to Jehovah and to offer praise in holy adornment as they went out ahead of the armed men, saying: \"Give thanks to Jehovah, for his loyal love endures forever.\"\n22 When they began joyfully singing praises, Jehovah set an ambush against the men of Ammon, Moab, and the mountainous region of Seir who were invading Judah, and they struck each other down. 23 And the Ammonites and the Moabites turned against the inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seir to destroy and annihilate them; and when they finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.\n24 But when Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness and looked toward the crowd, there they saw their carcasses fallen to the ground; there were no survivors. 25 So Jehoshaphat and his people came to carry off the spoil from them, and they found among them an abundance of goods, clothing, and desirable articles, which they stripped off for themselves until they could carry no more. It took three days to carry off the spoil, for it was abundant. 26 On the fourth day they congregated together at the Valley of Beracah, for there they praised Jehovah. That is why they named that place Valley of Beracah-until today.\n27 Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned to Jerusalem with rejoicing, for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies. 28 So they came into Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets and went to the house of Jehovah. 29 And the dread of God came upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel. 30 Thus the kingdom of Jehoshaphat had no disturbance, and his God continued to give him rest on every side.\n31 And Jehoshaphat continued reigning over Judah. He was 35 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 32 He kept walking in the way of his father Asa. He did not deviate from it, and he did what was right in Jehovah's eyes. 33 However, the high places were not removed, and the people had not yet prepared their heart for the God of their forefathers.\n34 As for the rest of the history of Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end, there it is written among the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which were included in the Book of the Kings of Israel. 35 After this King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who acted wickedly. 36 So he made him his partner in making ships to go to Tarshish, and they built the ships in Ezion-geber. 37 However, Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Maresha spoke prophetically against Jehoshaphat, saying: \"Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, Jehovah will destroy your works.\" So the ships were wrecked, and they were unable to go to Tarshish.\nChapter 21\n1 Then Jehoshaphat was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David; and his son Jehoram became king in his place. 2 His brothers, Jehoshaphat's sons, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all of these were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Israel. 3 And their father had given them many gifts in silver and gold, and valuable things, along with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the firstborn.\n4 When Jehoram had taken control of the kingdom of his father, he strengthened his position by killing all his brothers with the sword, as well as some of the princes of Israel. 5 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. 6 He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as those of the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab's daughter had become his wife; and he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. 7 But Jehovah did not want to bring the house of David to ruin for the sake of the covenant that he had made with David, since he had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons always.\n8 In his days Edom revolted against Judah and then set up its own king. 9 So Jehoram and his commanders crossed over with all his chariots, and he rose up by night and defeated the Edomites who were surrounding him and the chariot commanders. 10 But Edom has kept up its revolt against Judah to this day. Libnah also revolted against him at that time, because he had abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers. 11 He had also made high places on the mountains of Judah to cause the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution, and he led Judah astray.\n12 Eventually a written message came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying: \"This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says, 'You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or in the ways of King Asa of Judah. 13 But you walk in the way of the kings of Israel and cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution like the prostitution of the house of Ahab, and you even killed your own brothers, the household of your father, who were better than you. 14 Therefore, Jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people, to your sons, to your wives, and to all your possessions. 15 And you will suffer with many sicknesses, including a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out because of the disease, day after day.'\"\n16 Then Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the Philistines and the Arabs who were near the Ethiopians. 17 So they invaded Judah, forcing their way in, and carried off all the possessions that were found in the king's house, as well as his sons and his wives; and the only son left to him was Jehoahaz, his youngest son. 18 And after all of this, Jehovah afflicted him with an incurable disease in his intestines. 19 Some time later, when two full years had passed, his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died while suffering severely from his disease; and his people did not make a burning for him like the burning that was made for his forefathers. 20 He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted it when he died. So they buried him in the City of David, but not in the burial places of the kings.\nChapter 22\n1 Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made his youngest son Ahaziah king in his place, for the marauder band that came with the Arabs to the camp had killed all the older ones. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram began to reign as king of Judah. 2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri.\n3 He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother became his adviser in acting wickedly. 4 And he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, like the house of Ahab, for they became his advisers after the death of his father, to his destruction. 5 He followed their advice and went with Jehoram the son of King Ahab of Israel to wage war against King Hazael of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, where the archers wounded Jehoram. 6 He returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that they had inflicted on him at Ramah when he fought against King Hazael of Syria.\nAhaziah the son of Jehoram the king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Jehoram the son of Ahab, because he had been wounded. 7 But God brought about the downfall of Ahaziah by his coming to Jehoram; and when he came, he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the grandson of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to do away with the house of Ahab. 8 When Jehu began to execute judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, ministers of Ahaziah, and he killed them. 9 Then he looked for Ahaziah; they captured him where he was hiding in Samaria, and they brought him to Jehu. Then they put him to death and buried him, for they said: \"He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who searched for Jehovah with all his heart.\" There was no one of the house of Ahaziah who had the power to rule the kingdom.\n10 When Athaliah, Ahaziah's mother, saw that her son had died, she rose up and destroyed the entire royal line of the house of Judah. 11 However, Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were to be put to death, and she put him and his nurse in an inner bedroom. Jehoshabeath the daughter of King Jehoram (she was the wife of Jehoiada the priest and a sister of Ahaziah) managed to keep him concealed from Athaliah, so that she did not put him to death. 12 He remained with them for six years, hidden at the house of the true God, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.\nChapter 23\n1 In the seventh year, Jehoiada acted courageously and made a pact with the chiefs of hundreds, namely, Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. 2 Then they went throughout Judah and gathered together the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the heads of the paternal houses of Israel. When they came to Jerusalem, 3 the entire congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of the true God, after which he said to them:\n\"Look! The king's son will reign, just as Jehovah promised concerning the sons of David. 4 This is what you are to do: One third of the priests and of the Levites who will be on duty on the Sabbath will be doorkeepers; 5 another third will be at the house of the king, and the other third will be at the Gate of the Foundation, and all the people will be in the courtyards of the house of Jehovah. 6 Do not let anyone enter the house of Jehovah except the priests and the Levites who are ministering. These may enter because they are a holy group, and all the people will keep the obligation to Jehovah. 7 The Levites must surround the king on every side, each with his weapons in hand. Anyone entering the house will be put to death. Stay with the king wherever he goes.\"\n8 The Levites and all Judah did exactly what Jehoiada the priest had commanded. So each one took his men who were on duty on the Sabbath, together with those who were off duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions from their duty. 9 Jehoiada the priest then gave the chiefs of hundreds the spears and the bucklers and the circular shields that had belonged to King David, which were in the house of the true God. 10 He then stationed all the people, each with his weapon in hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and by the house, all around the king. 11 Then they brought the king's son out and put on him the crown and the Testimony and made him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. Then they said: \"Long live the king!\"\n12 When Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she immediately came to the people at the house of Jehovah. 13 Then she saw the king standing there by his pillar at the entrance. The princes and the trumpeters were with the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing the trumpets, and the singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. At this Athaliah ripped her garments apart and cried out: \"Conspiracy! Conspiracy!\" 14 But Jehoiada the priest brought out the chiefs of hundreds, those appointed over the army, and said to them: \"Take her out from among the ranks, and if anyone follows her, put him to death with the sword!\" For the priest had said: \"Do not put her to death in the house of Jehovah.\" 15 So they seized her, and when she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king's house, they immediately put her to death there.\n16 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king, that they would continue as the people of Jehovah. 17 After that all the people came to the house of Baal and tore it down, and they smashed his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. 18 Then Jehoiada put the oversight of the house of Jehovah in the hands of the priests and the Levites, whom David had assigned in divisions over the house of Jehovah to offer up the burnt sacrifices of Jehovah according to what is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with song, as directed by David. 19 He also stationed the gatekeepers by the gates of the house of Jehovah, so that no one unclean in any respect could enter. 20 He now took the chiefs of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land and escorted the king down from the house of Jehovah. Then they came through the upper gate to the king's house and seated the king on the throne of the kingdom. 21 So all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.\nChapter 24\n1 Jehoash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah from Beer-sheba. 2 Jehoash continued doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 3 Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he became father to sons and daughters.\n4 Afterward it was the heart's desire of Jehoash to renovate the house of Jehovah. 5 So he gathered the priests and the Levites together and said to them: \"Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God from year to year; and you should act quickly in the matter.\" But the Levites did not act quickly. 6 So the king called Jehoiada the chief and said to him: \"Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the sacred tax ordered by Moses the servant of Jehovah, the sacred tax of the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the Testimony? 7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of the true God, and they had used all the holy things of the house of Jehovah for the Baals.\" 8 Then, at the king's order, a chest was made and placed outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah. 9 After that a proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Jehovah the sacred tax that Moses the servant of the true God had imposed on Israel in the wilderness. 10 All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and they kept bringing contributions and dropping them into the chest until it was full.\n11 Whenever the Levites brought the chest in to be turned over to the king and they saw that there was a great deal of money in it, the secretary of the king and the commissioner of the chief priest would come and empty the chest, and then they would take it back to its place. That was what they did from day to day, and they gathered money in abundance. 12 Then the king and Jehoiada would give it to those supervising the work of the service of Jehovah's house, and they would hire the stonecutters and the craftsmen for renovating Jehovah's house, and also workers in iron and copper to repair Jehovah's house. 13 And those supervising the work got it started, and the repair work progressed under their supervision, and they restored the house of the true God to its proper condition and reinforced it. 14 And as soon as they finished, they brought the money that was left over to the king and Jehoiada, and they used it to make utensils for the house of Jehovah, utensils for the ministry and for making offerings and cups and utensils of gold and of silver. And they would offer up burnt sacrifices at the house of Jehovah regularly all the days of Jehoiada.\n15 When Jehoiada was old and satisfied with years, he died; he was 130 years old at his death. 16 So they buried him in the City of David along with the kings, because he had done good in Israel with respect to the true God and His house.\n17 After Jehoiada's death the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them. 18 They abandoned the house of Jehovah the God of their forefathers and began serving the sacred poles and the idols, so that God's anger came against Judah and Jerusalem because of their guilt. 19 He kept sending prophets among them to bring them back to Jehovah, and they kept warning them, but they refused to listen.\n20 God's spirit came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people and said to them: \"This is what the true God says, 'Why are you violating the commandments of Jehovah? You will not be successful! Because you have abandoned Jehovah, he will, in turn, abandon you.'\" 21 But they conspired against him and stoned him at the king's order in the courtyard of Jehovah's house. 22 Thus King Jehoash did not remember the loyal love that his father Jehoiada had shown toward him, and he killed his son, who said as he was dying: \"May Jehovah see to it and call you to account.\"\n23 At the beginning of the year the Syrian army came up against Jehoash, and they invaded Judah and Jerusalem. Then they did away with all the princes of the people, and they sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. 24 For although the invading Syrian army had a small number of men, Jehovah handed over to them a very large army, because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers; so they executed judgment on Jehoash. 25 And when they withdrew from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because he had shed the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest. They killed him on his own bed. So he died and they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the burial places of the kings.\n26 These were the conspirators against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 27 Regarding his sons and the many pronouncements against him and the renovation of the house of the true God, all these things are recorded in the writings of the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah became king in his place.\nChapter 25\n1 Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 2 He continued to do what was right in Jehovah's eyes, but not with a complete heart. 3 As soon as he had the kingdom firmly in his control, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king. 4 But he did not put their sons to death, for he acted in harmony with what is written in the Law, in the book of Moses, where Jehovah commanded: \"Fathers should not die for their sons, and sons should not die for their fathers; but each one should die for his own sin.\"\n5 And Amaziah gathered Judah together and had them stand according to the paternal houses, by the chiefs of thousands and by the chiefs of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He registered them from 20 years old and up, and he found them to be 300,000 trained warriors to serve in the army, able to handle the lance and the large shield. 6 Further, he hired from Israel 100,000 mighty warriors for 100 silver talents. 7 But a man of the true God came to him, saying: \"O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Jehovah is not with Israel, not with any of the Ephraimites. 8 But go by yourself, act, and be courageous in battle. Otherwise, the true God could cause you to stumble before an enemy, for God has the power to help and to cause stumbling.\" 9 At this Amaziah said to the man of the true God: \"But what about the 100 talents that I have given to the troops of Israel?\" The man of the true God replied: \"Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that.\" 10 So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, sending them to their own place. However, they were very angry with Judah, so they returned to their own place in the heat of anger.\n11 Then Amaziah took courage and led his own troops to the Valley of Salt, and he struck down 10,000 men of Seir. 12 And the men of Judah captured 10,000 alive. So they brought them to the top of the crag and threw them down from the top of the crag, and they were all dashed to pieces. 13 But the members of the troop whom Amaziah had sent back from accompanying him to the war were making raids on the cities of Judah, from Samaria clear to Beth-horon; they struck down 3,000 of them and took much spoil.\n14 But after Amaziah returned from striking down the Edomites, he brought the gods of the men of Seir and set them up for himself as gods, and he began to bow down before them and to make sacrificial smoke to them. 15 So Jehovah grew very angry with Amaziah, and he sent a prophet who said to him: \"Why are you following the people's gods that did not rescue their own people out of your hand?\" 16 As he spoke to him, the king said: \"Did we appoint you as an adviser to the king? Stop! Why should they strike you down?\" Then the prophet quit, but he added: \"I know that God has decided to bring you to ruin, because you have done this and you have not listened to my advice.\"\n17 After consulting with his advisers, King Amaziah of Judah sent a message to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu the king of Israel, saying: \"Come, let us confront each other in battle.\" 18 King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah: \"The thorny weed in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' However, a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thorny weed. 19 You have said, 'Look! I have struck down Edom.' So your heart has become arrogant, wanting to be glorified. But now stay in your own house. Why should you provoke disaster and fall, bringing Judah down with you?\"\n20 But Amaziah did not listen, for this was from the true God to give them into the hand of the enemy, because they had followed the gods of Edom. 21 So King Jehoash of Israel went up, and he and King Amaziah of Judah confronted each other in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 22 Judah was defeated by Israel, so each one fled to his home. 23 King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, son of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh. Then he brought him to Jerusalem and made a breach in the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 24 He took all the gold and the silver and all the articles that were found in the house of the true God with Obed-edom and in the treasuries of the king's house, as well as hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.\n25 Amaziah the son of Jehoash the king of Judah lived for 15 years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz the king of Israel. 26 As for the rest of the history of Amaziah, from beginning to end, look! is it not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel? 27 From the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah, they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and put him to death there. 28 So they carried him back on horses and buried him with his forefathers in the city of Judah.\nChapter 26\n1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was 16 years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 2 He rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king was laid to rest with his forefathers. 3 Uzziah was 16 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 4 He continued to do what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father Amaziah had done. 5 And he kept searching for God in the days of Zechariah, who taught him to fear the true God. During the time he was searching for Jehovah, the true God made him prosper.\n6 He went out and fought against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. Then he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and among the Philistines. 7 The true God continued to help him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who were dwelling in Gurbaal, and against the Meunim. 8 The Ammonites began to give tribute to Uzziah. His fame eventually spread as far as Egypt, for he became extremely powerful. 9 Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem by the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the Buttress, and he fortified them. 10 Further, he built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns (for he had a great deal of livestock); he also did so in the Shephelah and on the plain. He had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved agriculture.\n11 Moreover, Uzziah came to have an army equipped for war. They would go out on military campaigns, organized in divisions. They were numbered and registered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the command of Hananiah, one of the king's princes. 12 The entire number of the heads of the paternal houses who were over these mighty warriors was 2,600. 13 The armed forces under their command numbered 307,500 men ready for war, a powerful military force to support the king against the enemy. 14 Uzziah equipped the entire army with shields, lances, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and slingstones. 15 Further, in Jerusalem he made engines of war designed by engineers; they were set on the towers and on the corners of the walls and could shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread far and wide, for he received tremendous help and he became strong.\n16 However, as soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty to his own ruin, and he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God by entering the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense. 17 Immediately Azariah the priest and 80 other courageous priests of Jehovah went in after him. 18 They confronted King Uzziah and said to him: \"It is not proper for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah! It is only the priests who should burn incense, for they are the descendants of Aaron, those who have been sanctified. Go out from the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully and you will receive no glory from Jehovah God for this.\"\n19 But Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand to burn incense, became enraged; and during his rage against the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of Jehovah next to the altar of incense. 20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned toward him, they saw that he had been stricken with leprosy in his forehead! So they rushed him out of there, and he himself hurried out, because Jehovah had struck him.\n21 King Uzziah remained a leper until the day of his death, and he kept staying in a separate house as a leper, for he had been excluded from the house of Jehovah. His son Jotham was in charge of the king's house, judging the people of the land.\n22 And the rest of the history of Uzziah, from beginning to end, was recorded by the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. 23 Then Uzziah was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him with his forefathers, but in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said: \"He is a leper.\" And his son Jotham became king in his place.\nChapter 27\n1 Jotham was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 2 He kept doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father Uzziah had done, except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah. But the people were still acting ruinously. 3 He built the upper gate of Jehovah's house, and he did much building on the wall of Ophel. 4 He also built cities in the mountainous region of Judah, and he built fortified places and towers in the wooded areas. 5 He waged war against the king of the Ammonites and eventually prevailed against them, so that the Ammonites gave him in that year 100 silver talents, 10,000 cor measures of wheat, and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites also paid this to him in the second and third years. 6 So Jotham kept growing strong, for he established his ways before Jehovah his God.\n7 As for the rest of the history of Jotham, all his wars and his ways, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah. 8 He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. 9 Then Jotham was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son Ahaz became king in his place.\nChapter 28\n1 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in Jehovah's eyes as David his forefather had done. 2 Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and he even made metal statues of the Baals. 3 Moreover, he made sacrificial smoke in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom and burned up his sons in the fire, following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the Israelites. 4 He also kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places, on the hills, and under every luxuriant tree.\n5 So Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, so that they defeated him and carried off a great number of captives and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who inflicted on him a great slaughter. 6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah 120,000 in one day, all brave men, because they had abandoned Jehovah the God of their forefathers. 7 And Zichri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed the king's son Maaseiah and Azrikam, who was in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, who was second to the king. 8 Moreover, the Israelites took 200,000 of their brothers captive-women, sons, and daughters; they also seized a great deal of spoil, and they took the spoil to Samaria.\n9 But a prophet of Jehovah named Oded was there. He went out before the army that was coming to Samaria and said to them: \"Look! It was because Jehovah the God of your forefathers was angry with Judah that he gave them into your hand, and you slaughtered them with a fury that has reached clear to the heavens. 10 And now you intend to make the people of Judah and Jerusalem your male and female servants. Nevertheless, are you not also guilty before Jehovah your God? 11 Now listen to me and return the captives whom you took from your brothers, for Jehovah's burning anger is against you.\"\n12 At that some of the chiefs of the Ephraimites, Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, confronted those coming in from the military campaign, 13 and they said to them: \"Do not bring the captives in here, for it will make us guilty before Jehovah. What you intend to do will add to our sins and to our guilt, for our guilt is already great and there is burning anger against Israel.\" 14 So the armed soldiers handed over the captives and the plunder to the princes and the entire congregation. 15 Then the men who had been designated by name rose up and took hold of the captives, and they provided clothes from the spoil for all those among them who were naked. So they clothed them and gave them sandals, food and drink, and oil for their skin. Furthermore, they transported the feeble on donkeys and brought them to their brothers in Jericho, the city of palm trees. After that they returned to Samaria.\n16 At that time King Ahaz asked the kings of Assyria for help. 17 And once again the Edomites invaded and attacked Judah and carried off captives. 18 The Philistines also made a raid on the cities of the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah and captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco and its dependent towns, Timnah and its dependent towns, and Gimzo and its dependent towns; and they settled there. 19 Jehovah humbled Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel, for he had let Judah go unrestrained, resulting in great unfaithfulness toward Jehovah.\n20 King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria eventually came against him and caused him distress rather than strengthening him. 21 For Ahaz had stripped the house of Jehovah and the house of the king and the houses of the princes and made a gift to the king of Assyria; but it was of no help to him. 22 And during his time of distress, King Ahaz acted even more unfaithfully toward Jehovah. 23 He began to sacrifice to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him, and he went on to say: \"Because the gods of the kings of Syria are helping them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me.\" But they caused him and all Israel to stumble. 24 Furthermore, Ahaz collected the utensils of the house of the true God; he then cut to pieces the utensils of the house of the true God, closed the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem. 25 And in all the cities of Judah, he made high places for making sacrificial smoke to other gods, and he offended Jehovah the God of his forefathers.\n26 As for the rest of his history, all his dealings from beginning to end, there it is written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel. 27 Then Ahaz was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the burial places of the kings of Israel. And his son Hezekiah became king in his place.\nChapter 29\n1 Hezekiah became king at the age of 25, and he reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. 2 He kept doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as David his forefather had done. 3 In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them. 4 Then he brought the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square to the east. 5 He said to them: \"Listen to me, you Levites. Now sanctify yourselves and sanctify the house of Jehovah the God of your forefathers, and remove what is impure from the holy place. 6 For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah our God. They abandoned him and turned their faces away from the tabernacle of Jehovah and turned their back on him. 7 They also closed the doors of the porch and extinguished the lamps. They stopped burning incense and offering up burnt sacrifices in the holy place to the God of Israel. 8 Therefore, Jehovah's indignation came against Judah and Jerusalem, so that he made them an object of horror and astonishment and a cause for whistling, as you can see with your own eyes. 9 Here our forefathers fell by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives went into captivity for this. 10 Now it is my heart's desire to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, so that his burning anger may turn away from us. 11 My sons, now is not the time to be negligent, for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to serve as his ministers, and to make his sacrifices smoke.\"\n12 At that the Levites rose up: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah of the Kohathites; from the Merarites, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; 13 from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 14 from the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 15 Then they gathered their brothers together and sanctified themselves and came, as the king had commanded by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah. 16 The priests then went inside the house of Jehovah to do the cleansing and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah and took it to the courtyard of the house of Jehovah. In turn the Levites took it and carried it outside to the Kidron Valley. 17 Thus they began the sanctification on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they reached the porch of Jehovah. They sanctified the house of Jehovah for eight days, and on the 16th day of the first month they finished.\n18 After that they went in to King Hezekiah and said: \"We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table of the layer bread and all its utensils. 19 And all the utensils that King Ahaz cast aside during his reign when he acted unfaithfully we have made ready and sanctified, and they are before the altar of Jehovah.\"\n20 And King Hezekiah got up early and gathered the princes of the city together, and they went up to the house of Jehovah. 21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. So he told the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer them up on the altar of Jehovah. 22 Then they slaughtered the cattle, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar, and they slaughtered the male lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 23 Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering before the king and the congregation and laid their hands on them. 24 The priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel, because the king said that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be for all Israel.\n25 Meanwhile, he had the Levites stationed at the house of Jehovah with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, by the commandment of David and of Gad the king's visionary and of Nathan the prophet, for the commandment was from Jehovah through his prophets. 26 So the Levites were standing with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.\n27 Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt sacrifice be offered on the altar. When the burnt offering started, the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets, following the direction of the instruments of King David of Israel. 28 And the whole congregation bowed down while the song was sung and the trumpets were sounding-all this continued until the burnt offering was finished. 29 And as soon as they finished making the offering, the king and all those with him bowed low and prostrated themselves. 30 King Hezekiah and the princes now told the Levites to praise Jehovah with the words of David and of Asaph the visionary. So they offered praise with great rejoicing, and they bowed down and prostrated themselves.\n31 Then Hezekiah said: \"Now that you have been set apart for Jehovah, come and bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings to the house of Jehovah.\" So the congregation began to bring sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings, and everyone with a willing heart brought burnt offerings. 32 The number of burnt offerings that the congregation brought was 70 cattle, 100 rams, 200 male lambs-all of these as a burnt offering to Jehovah- 33 and the holy offerings were 600 cattle and 3,000 of the flock. 34 But there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings, so their brothers the Levites helped them out until the work was finished and until the priests could sanctify themselves, for the Levites were more conscientious about sanctifying themselves than the priests were. 35 Also, there were many burnt offerings, as well as the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of Jehovah was restored. 36 So Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what the true God had established for the people, for this had all happened so suddenly.\nChapter 30\n1 Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah, and even wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem to observe the Passover to Jehovah the God of Israel. 2 However, the king, his princes, and the whole congregation in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover in the second month, 3 for they had not been able to observe it at the regular time, because not enough priests had sanctified themselves nor had the people gathered in Jerusalem. 4 This arrangement seemed right in the eyes of the king and the entire congregation. 5 So they decided to make an announcement throughout Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and observe the Passover to Jehovah the God of Israel at Jerusalem, for as a group they had not observed it according to what is written.\n6 Then the couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying: \"People of Israel, return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may return to the remnant who escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. 7 Do not be like your forefathers and your brothers who acted unfaithfully toward Jehovah the God of their forefathers, so that he made them an object of horror, just as you are seeing. 8 Now do not be obstinate like your forefathers. Submit to Jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified forever and serve Jehovah your God, so that his burning anger may turn away from you. 9 For when you return to Jehovah, your brothers and your sons will be shown mercy by their captors and will be allowed to return to this land, for Jehovah your God is compassionate and merciful, and he will not turn his face away from you if you return to him.\"\n10 So the couriers went from city to city throughout the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, but the people were making fun of them and mocking them. 11 However, some individuals from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 12 The hand of the true God was also in Judah to unite them to carry out what the king and the princes had commanded by the word of Jehovah.\n13 A multitude of people gathered together at Jerusalem to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month; it was a very large congregation. 14 They rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley. 15 Then they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice on the 14th day of the second month. The priests and the Levites felt ashamed, so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah. 16 They took their customary places, according to the Law of Moses the man of the true God; then the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites. 17 There were many in the congregation who had not sanctified themselves, and the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover sacrifices for all who were not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah. 18 For a great number of the people, especially those from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, but they still ate the Passover, contrary to what is written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying: \"May Jehovah, who is good, make allowance for 19 everyone who has prepared his heart to search for the true God, Jehovah, the God of his forefathers, although he has not been purified according to the standard of holiness.\" 20 And Jehovah listened to Hezekiah and pardoned the people.\n21 So the Israelites who were in Jerusalem observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, and the Levites and the priests were praising Jehovah day by day, loudly playing their instruments to Jehovah. 22 Moreover, Hezekiah spoke to and encouraged all the Levites who served Jehovah with discretion. And they ate throughout the festival for seven days, sacrificing communion sacrifices and giving thanks to Jehovah the God of their forefathers.\n23 Then all the congregation decided to observe it for seven more days, so they observed it for seven more days with rejoicing. 24 And King Hezekiah of Judah contributed for the congregation 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the princes contributed for the congregation 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep; and priests were sanctifying themselves in great number. 25 And all the congregation of Judah, the priests, the Levites, all the congregation that came from Israel, and the foreign residents who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah continued rejoicing. 26 And there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel, nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem. 27 Finally the Levite priests stood up and blessed the people; and God heard their voice, and their prayer reached his holy dwelling, the heavens.\nChapter 31\n1 As soon as they had finished all of this, all the Israelites who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and they smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the sacred poles, and tore down the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them completely, after which all the Israelites returned to their cities, each one to his own possession.\n2 Then Hezekiah appointed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their divisions, each of the priests and Levites for their service, for the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices, to minister and to give thanks and praise in the gates of the courtyards of Jehovah. 3 A portion of the king's own goods was given for the burnt offerings, including the morning and evening offerings, as well as the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the festivals, according to what is written in the Law of Jehovah.\n4 Furthermore, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and the Levites, so that they might adhere strictly to the law of Jehovah. 5 As soon as the order was issued, the Israelites gave in great quantities the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field; they brought in abundantly the tenth of everything. 6 And the people of Israel and of Judah living in the cities of Judah also brought in the tenth of cattle and sheep and the tenth of the holy things that were sanctified to Jehovah their God. They brought it in and put it in many heaps. 7 In the third month they began laying their contributions in heaps; and in the seventh month they finished. 8 When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they praised Jehovah and blessed his people Israel.\n9 Hezekiah asked the priests and the Levites about the heaps, 10 and Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok said to him: \"From the time they started bringing the contributions into the house of Jehovah, the people have been eating to satisfaction and there is still an abundant surplus, for Jehovah has blessed his people, and this great plenty is left over.\"\n11 At this Hezekiah told them to prepare storerooms in the house of Jehovah, so they prepared them. 12 They kept faithfully bringing in the contributions, the tenth parts, and the holy things; Conaniah the Levite was put in charge of all of this as supervisor, and his brother Shimei was second. 13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were commissioners assisting Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by the order of King Hezekiah, and Azariah was supervisor of the house of the true God. 14 And Kore the son of Imnah, the Levite gatekeeper on the east side, was in charge of the voluntary offerings of the true God, and he distributed the contribution made to Jehovah and the most holy things. 15 And under his direction were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to distribute equally to their brothers in the divisions, to great and small alike. 16 This was in addition to the distribution made to the males from three years old and up who were listed in the genealogical enrollment, who came daily to serve in the house of Jehovah and to carry out the duties of their divisions.\n17 The genealogical enrollment of the priests was by their paternal house, as was that of the Levites who were 20 years old and up, by the duties of their divisions. 18 The genealogical enrollment included all their children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, their entire congregation-for they kept themselves sanctified for what was holy because of their office of trust- 19 as well as the descendants of Aaron, the priests who were living in the fields of the pastures surrounding their cities. In all the cities, men had been designated by name to give portions to every male among the priests and to everyone included in the genealogical enrollment of the Levites.\n20 Hezekiah did this throughout Judah, and he continued to do what was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God. 21 And every work that he undertook to search for his God, whether in connection with the service of the house of the true God or in the Law and the commandment, he did wholeheartedly, and he was successful.\nChapter 32\n1 After these things and these acts of faithfulness, King Sennacherib of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He besieged the fortified cities, intent on breaking through and capturing them.\n2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to wage war against Jerusalem, 3 he decided, after consulting with his princes and his warriors, to stop up the waters of the springs outside the city, and they gave him their support. 4 Many people were gathered together, and they stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land, saying: \"Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?\"\n5 Furthermore, with determination he rebuilt the entire broken-down wall and raised towers on it, and outside he made another wall. He also repaired the Mound of the City of David, and he made a large number of weapons and shields. 6 He then appointed military chiefs over the people and assembled them at the public square of the city gate and encouraged them, saying: 7 \"Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or be terrified because of the king of Assyria and all the multitude with him, for there are more with us than there are with him. 8 With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles.\" And the people were strengthened by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.\n9 After this, while King Sennacherib of Assyria was at Lachish with all his imperial might, he sent his servants to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all the Judeans in Jerusalem, saying:\n10 \"This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says, 'In what are you trusting that you remain in Jerusalem while it is besieged? 11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you and handing you over to die by famine and thirst, saying: \"Jehovah our God will rescue us from the hand of the king of Assyria\"? 12 Is this not the same Hezekiah who removed your God's high places and His altars and then said to Judah and Jerusalem: \"You should bow down before one altar and on it you should make your sacrifices smoke\"? 13 Do you not know what I and my forefathers did to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands able to rescue their land from my hand? 14 Who among all the gods of these nations that my forefathers devoted to destruction was able to rescue his people from my hand, so that your God should be able to rescue you from my hand? 15 Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you like this! Do not put faith in him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to rescue his people from my hand and from the hand of my forefathers. How much less, then, will your own God rescue you from my hand!'\"\n16 His servants said even more against Jehovah the true God and against Hezekiah his servant. 17 He also wrote letters to insult Jehovah the God of Israel and to speak against him, saying: \"Like the gods of the nations of the lands who could not rescue their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand.\" 18 They kept calling loudly in the language of the Jews to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to make them afraid and to terrify them, in order to capture the city. 19 They spoke against the God of Jerusalem the same way as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of man's hands. 20 But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz kept praying about this and crying out to the heavens for help.\n21 Then Jehovah sent an angel and wiped out every mighty warrior, leader, and chief in the camp of the king of Assyria, so that he went back to his own land in disgrace. He later entered the house of his god, and there some of his own sons struck him down with the sword. 22 So Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of King Sennacherib of Assyria and from the hand of all others and gave them rest on every side. 23 And many brought gifts to Jehovah at Jerusalem and choice things to King Hezekiah of Judah, and he was greatly respected by all the nations after that.\n24 In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to Jehovah, who answered him and gave him a sign. 25 But Hezekiah did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him, for his heart became haughty, bringing indignation against him and against Judah and Jerusalem. 26 However, Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and Jehovah's indignation did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.\n27 And Hezekiah came to have vast riches and glory; and he made storehouses for himself for silver, gold, precious stones, balsam oil, shields, and for all the desirable articles. 28 He also made storage places for the produce of grain and new wine and oil, as well as stalls for all the different kinds of livestock and stalls for the flocks. 29 He also acquired cities for himself, and an abundance of livestock, flocks, and herds, for God gave him very many possessions. 30 It was Hezekiah who stopped up the upper source of the waters of Gihon and directed them straight down to the west to the City of David, and Hezekiah was successful in every work of his. 31 However, when the spokesmen of the princes of Babylon were sent to ask him about the sign that had occurred in the land, the true God left him alone to put him to the test, to get to know all that was in his heart.\n32 As for the rest of the history of Hezekiah and his acts of loyal love, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel. 33 Then Hezekiah was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became king in his place.\nChapter 33\n1 Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 55 years in Jerusalem.\n2 He did what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had driven out from before the people of Israel. 3 He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down, he set up altars to the Baals and made sacred poles, and he bowed down to all the army of the heavens and served them. 4 He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, about which Jehovah had said: \"In Jerusalem my name will be forever.\" 5 And he built altars to all the army of the heavens in two courtyards of the house of Jehovah. 6 And he made his own sons pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; he practiced magic, used divination, practiced sorcery, and appointed spirit mediums and fortune-tellers. He did on a grand scale what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, to offend him.\n7 He put the carved image that he made into the house of the true God about which God had said to David and to his son Solomon: \"In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will permanently put my name. 8 And I will never again remove the feet of Israel from the land that I assigned to their forefathers, provided they carefully observe all that I have commanded them, the entire Law, the regulations and the judicial decisions given through Moses.\" 9 Manasseh kept leading Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, causing them to do worse than the nations that Jehovah had annihilated from before the Israelites.\n10 Jehovah kept speaking to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention. 11 So Jehovah brought against them the army chiefs of the king of Assyria, and they captured Manasseh with hooks and bound him with two copper fetters and took him to Babylon. 12 In his distress, he begged Jehovah his God for favor and kept humbling himself greatly before the God of his forefathers. 13 He kept praying to Him, and He was moved by his entreaty and heard his request for favor, and He restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship. Then Manasseh came to know that Jehovah is the true God.\n14 After this he built an outer wall for the City of David west of Gihon in the valley and as far as the Fish Gate, and he continued it around to Ophel, and he made it very high. Further, he appointed army chiefs in all the fortified cities in Judah. 15 He then removed the foreign gods and the idol image from the house of Jehovah and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and he had them thrown outside the city. 16 He also prepared the altar of Jehovah and began to offer up communion sacrifices and thanksgiving sacrifices on it, and he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel. 17 Nevertheless, the people were still sacrificing on the high places, although only to Jehovah their God.\n18 As for the rest of the history of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the visionaries who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, they are recorded in the history of the kings of Israel. 19 Also his prayer and how his entreaty was granted him, all his sins and his unfaithfulness, the locations where he built high places and set up the sacred poles and the graven images before he humbled himself, they are written among the words of his visionaries. 20 Then Manasseh was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him at his house; and his son Amon became king in his place.\n21 Amon was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. 22 And he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes, just as his father Manasseh had done; and Amon sacrificed to all the graven images that his father Manasseh had made, and he kept serving them. 23 But he did not humble himself before Jehovah as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; instead, Amon greatly increased his guilt. 24 Eventually his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house. 25 But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.\nChapter 34\n1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem. 2 He did what was right in Jehovah's eyes and walked in the ways of David his forefather, and he did not deviate to the right or to the left.\n3 In the 8th year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he started to search for the God of David his forefather; and in the 12th year, he started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places and the sacred poles, the graven images, and the metal statues. 4 Further, they tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and he cut down the incense stands that were up above them. He also broke into pieces the sacred poles, the graven images, and the metal statues and reduced them to powder and sprinkled it over the graves of those who used to sacrifice to them. 5 And he burned the bones of priests on their altars. Thus he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.\n6 And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and clear to Naphtali, in their surrounding ruins, 7 he tore down the altars and he crushed the sacred poles and the graven images, reducing them to powder; and he cut down all the incense stands in all the land of Israel, after which he returned to Jerusalem.\n8 In the 18th year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the chief of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the house of Jehovah his God. 9 They came to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought to the house of God, which the Levites serving as doorkeepers had collected from Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the rest of Israel, as well as from Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 10 Then they gave it to those who were appointed over the work in the house of Jehovah. In turn the workers in the house of Jehovah used it to mend and repair the house. 11 They gave it to the craftsmen and the builders to buy hewn stones and timbers for braces and to build with beams the houses that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.\n12 And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were appointed the Levites Jahath and Obadiah of the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam of the Kohathites, to serve as overseers. And the Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians, 13 were in charge of the common laborers and were overseers of all those who were doing the work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.\n14 While they were taking out the money that had been brought to the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of Jehovah's Law given through Moses. 15 So Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary: \"I have found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.\" With that Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan. 16 Then Shaphan brought the book to the king and told him: \"Your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them. 17 They have poured out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and they have handed it over to the appointed men and to those doing the work.\" 18 Shaphan the secretary also told the king: \"There is a book that Hilkiah the priest has given me.\" Then Shaphan began to read from it before the king.\n19 As soon as the king heard the words of the Law, he ripped his garments apart. 20 Then the king gave this order to Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant: 21 \"Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf and in behalf of those who remain in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that has been found; for Jehovah's rage that will be poured out against us is great because our forefathers did not carry out the word of Jehovah by observing all that is written in this book.\"\n22 So Hilkiah, along with those sent by the king, went to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah son of Harhas, the caretaker of the wardrobe, and she was dwelling in the Second Quarter of Jerusalem; and they spoke to her there. 23 She said to them: \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, 'Tell the man who sent you to me: 24 \"This is what Jehovah says, 'I will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that they read before the king of Judah. 25 Because they have abandoned me and are making sacrifices smoke to other gods in order to offend me with all the works of their hands, my rage will pour out on this place and it will not be extinguished.'\" 26 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, this is what you should say to him, \"This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: 'Regarding the words that you have heard, 27 because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God on hearing his words concerning this place and its inhabitants and you humbled yourself before me and ripped your garments apart and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares Jehovah. 28 That is why I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be laid in your grave in peace, and your eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place and its inhabitants.'\"'\"\nThen they brought the reply to the king. 29 So the king sent word and summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 30 After that the king went up to the house of Jehovah with all the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites-all the people, the great as well as the small. He read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of Jehovah. 31 The king stood in his place and made a covenant before Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and keep his commandments, his reminders, and his regulations with all his heart and with all his soul by carrying out the words of the covenant that were written in this book. 32 Furthermore, he had all those who were in Jerusalem and Benjamin to agree to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of God, the God of their forefathers. 33 Josiah then removed all the detestable things out of all the lands that belonged to the Israelites, and he made everyone in Israel serve Jehovah their God. Throughout his lifetime they did not deviate from following Jehovah the God of their forefathers.\nChapter 35\n1 Josiah held a Passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover sacrifice on the 14th day of the first month. 2 He assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them to carry out their service of the house of Jehovah. 3 Then he said to the Levites, the instructors of all Israel, those who were holy to Jehovah: \"Put the holy Ark in the house that Solomon the son of David the king of Israel built; you are no longer to carry it on your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God and his people Israel. 4 And prepare yourselves by your paternal houses according to your divisions, following what was written by King David of Israel and by his son Solomon. 5 Stand in the holy place grouped by the paternal houses of your brothers, the rest of the people, with a corresponding group of the paternal house of the Levites. 6 Slaughter the Passover sacrifice and sanctify yourselves and make preparation for your brothers to carry out the word of Jehovah through Moses.\"\n7 Josiah contributed flocks to the people, male lambs and young male goats, for the Passover sacrifices for all who were present, a total of 30,000, as well as 3,000 cattle. These were from the king's own property. 8 His princes also made a contribution as a voluntary offering for the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the leaders of the house of the true God, gave to the priests 2,600 Passover sacrifices and 300 cattle. 9 Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, contributed to the Levites 5,000 Passover sacrifices and 500 cattle.\n10 The service was prepared, and the priests stood at their places and the Levites by their divisions, as the king had commanded. 11 They slaughtered the Passover sacrifices, and the priests sprinkled the blood they received from them, while the Levites were skinning the animals. 12 Next they prepared the burnt offerings so as to distribute them to the rest of the people, who were grouped by paternal house, so that they could be presented to Jehovah as it is written in the book of Moses; and they did the same with the cattle. 13 They cooked the Passover offering over the fire according to the custom; and they cooked the holy offerings in pots, cauldrons, and pans, after which they brought it quickly to all the rest of the people. 14 Then they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were offering up the burnt sacrifices and the fat pieces until nightfall, so the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.\n15 And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were at their positions by the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the visionary of the king; and the gatekeepers were at the different gates. There was no need for them to leave their service, because their brothers the Levites made preparations for them. 16 So all the service of Jehovah was prepared on that day to hold the Passover and to offer up the burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah, according to the order of King Josiah.\n17 The Israelites who were present held the Passover at that time and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 18 There had never been held a Passover like it in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the other kings of Israel held a Passover like that held by Josiah, the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 19 This Passover was held in the 18th year of Josiah's reign.\n20 After all of this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, King Necho of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates. Then Josiah went out against him. 21 So he sent messengers to him, saying: \"What does this have to do with you, O king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but my fight is against another house, and God says that I should hurry. For your own sake, refrain from opposing God, who is with me, or he will bring you to ruin.\" 22 However, Josiah would not turn away from him, but he disguised himself to fight against him and would not listen to the words of Necho, which were from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Plain of Megiddo.\n23 And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants: \"Get me out of here, for I am severely wounded.\" 24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and had him ride in his second war chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. Thus he died and was buried in the tomb of his forefathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned Josiah. 25 And Jeremiah chanted over Josiah, and all the male and female singers keep singing about Josiah in their dirges down to this day; and a decision was made that they should be sung in Israel, and they are written among the dirges.\n26 As for the rest of the history of Josiah and his deeds of loyal love, in keeping with what is written in the Law of Jehovah, 27 and what he did, from beginning to end, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah.\nChapter 36\n1 Then the people of the land took Josiah's son Jehoahaz and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father. 2 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. 3 However, the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and fined the land 100 silver talents and a gold talent. 4 Furthermore, the king of Egypt made Jehoahaz' brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed his name to Jehoiakim; but Necho took his brother Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt.\n5 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem. He continued to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah his God. 6 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against him in order to bind him with two copper fetters to take him off to Babylon. 7 And Nebuchadnezzar took some of the utensils of the house of Jehovah to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon. 8 As for the rest of the history of Jehoiakim, the detestable things that he did and what was found against him, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah; and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.\n9 Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah's eyes. 10 At the start of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent to have him brought to Babylon, along with valuable articles of the house of Jehovah. And he made his father's brother Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.\n11 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 11 years in Jerusalem. 12 He continued to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah his God. He did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah, who spoke at the order of Jehovah. 13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath by God, and he remained stubborn and hardhearted and refused to turn to Jehovah the God of Israel. 14 All the chiefs of the priests as well as the people were exceedingly unfaithful, practicing all the detestable things of the nations, and they defiled the house of Jehovah that he had sanctified in Jerusalem.\n15 Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers, warning them again and again, because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place. 16 But they kept ridiculing the messengers of the true God, and they despised his words and mocked his prophets, until the rage of Jehovah came up against his people, until they were beyond healing.\n17 So he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary; he felt no compassion for young man or virgin, old or infirm. God gave everything into his hand. 18 All the utensils of the house of the true God, great and small, as well as the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king and his princes, everything he brought to Babylon. 19 He burned down the house of the true God, tore down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its fortified towers with fire, and destroyed everything of value. 20 He carried off captive to Babylon those who escaped the sword, and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia began to reign, 21 to fulfill Jehovah's word spoken by Jeremiah, until the land had paid off its sabbaths. All the days it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill 70 years.\n22 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that Jehovah's word spoken by Jeremiah would be fulfilled, Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom, which he also put in writing, saying: 23 \"This is what King Cyrus of Persia says, 'Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.'\" \n",

    "text": "Job\nChapter 1\n1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was an upright man of integrity; he feared God and shunned what was bad. 2 Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 3 His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys, along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.\n4 Each of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For Job said: \"Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.\" That is what Job would always do.\n6 Now the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them.\n7 Then Jehovah said to Satan: \"Where have you come from?\" Satan answered Jehovah: \"From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.\" 8 And Jehovah said to Satan: \"Have you taken note of my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.\" 9 At that Satan answered Jehovah: \"Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? 10 Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in the land. 11 But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.\" 12 Then Jehovah said to Satan: \"Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!\" So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah.\n13 Now on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 14 a messenger came to Job and said: \"The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them 15 when the Sabeans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\"\n16 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: \"Fire from God fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\"\n17 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: \"The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\"\n18 While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: \"Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house. 19 Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\"\n20 At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down 21 and said:\n\"Naked I came out of my mother's womb,\nAnd naked I will return.\nJehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away.\nLet the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.\"\n22 In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong.\nChapter 2\n1 Afterward the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them to take his station before Jehovah.\n2 Then Jehovah said to Satan: \"Where have you come from?\" Satan answered Jehovah: \"From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.\" 3 And Jehovah said to Satan: \"Have you taken note of my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad. He is still holding firmly to his integrity, even though you try to incite me against him to destroy him for no reason.\" 4 But Satan answered Jehovah: \"Skin for skin. A man will give everything that he has for his life. 5 But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.\"\n6 Then Jehovah said to Satan: \"Look! He is in your hand! Only do not take his life!\" 7 So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 8 And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself, and he was sitting among the ashes.\n9 Finally his wife said to him: \"Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God and die!\" 10 But he said to her: \"You are talking like one of the senseless women. Should we accept only what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?\" In all of this, Job did not sin with his lips.\n11 Three companions of Job heard about all the calamities that had come upon him, and each came from his own place-Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. So they agreed to meet together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him. 12 When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. They began to weep loudly and to rip their garments apart, and they threw dust into the air and onto their heads. 13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.\nChapter 3\n1 It was after this that Job began to speak and to curse the day of his birth. 2 Job said:\n3 \"Let the day perish on which I was born,\nAlso the night when someone said: 'A man has been conceived!'\n4 Let that day be darkness.\nLet God above show no concern for it;\nLet no light shine upon it.\n5 Let the deepest darkness reclaim it.\nLet a rain cloud settle over it.\nLet whatever darkens the day terrify it.\n6 That night-let the gloom seize it;\nLet it not rejoice among the days of a year,\nAnd let it not enter among the number of the months.\n7 Indeed! Let that night become barren;\nLet no joyful cry be heard in it.\n8 Let those who curse the day put a curse on it,\nThose who are able to awaken Leviathan.\n9 Let the stars of its twilight grow dark;\nLet it wait in vain for daylight,\nAnd let it not see the rays of dawn.\n10 For it did not close the doors of my mother's womb;\nNor did it hide trouble from my eyes.\n11 Why did I not die at birth?\nWhy did I not perish when I came from the womb?\n12 Why were there knees to receive me\nAnd breasts to nurse me?\n13 For now I would be lying down undisturbed;\nI would be sleeping and at rest\n14 With kings of the earth and their advisers,\nWho built for themselves places that are now in ruins,\n15 Or with princes who possessed gold,\nWhose houses were filled with silver.\n16 Or why was I not like a hidden miscarriage,\nLike children who have never seen the light?\n17 There even the wicked have ceased from agitation;\nThere the weary are at rest.\n18 There the prisoners are at ease together;\nThey do not hear the voice of the one forcing them to work.\n19 Small and great are the same there,\nAnd the slave is set free from his master.\n20 Why does he give light to one who is suffering\nAnd life to those in bitter distress?\n21 Why do they long for death, but it does not come?\nThey dig for it more than for hidden treasures,\n22 Those who are rejoicing greatly,\nWho are happy when they find the grave.\n23 Why does he give light to a man who has lost his way,\nWhom God has hedged in?\n24 For in place of my food comes my sighing,\nAnd my groaning pours out like water.\n25 For what I have dreaded has come upon me,\nAnd what I have feared has befallen me.\n26 I have had no peace, no quiet, no rest,\nBut trouble keeps coming.\"\nChapter 4\n1 Eliphaz the Temanite then said in reply:\n2 \"If someone tries to speak to you, will you become impatient?\nFor who can hold back from speaking?\n3 True, you have corrected many,\nAnd you used to strengthen the weak hands.\n4 Your words would raise up anyone stumbling,\nAnd you would strengthen those whose knees were buckling.\n5 But now it has happened to you, and you are overwhelmed;\nIt touches you, and you are dismayed.\n6 Does your reverence for God not give you confidence?\nDoes your way of integrity not give you hope?\n7 Remember, please: What innocent person has ever perished?\nWhen have the upright ever been destroyed?\n8 What I have seen is that those who plow what is harmful\nAnd those who sow trouble will reap the same.\n9 By the breath of God they perish,\nAnd through a blast of his anger they come to an end.\n10 The lion roars, and a young lion growls,\nBut even the teeth of strong lions are broken.\n11 A lion perishes for lack of prey,\nAnd the cubs of a lion are scattered.\n12 Now a word was brought to me in secret,\nAnd a whisper of it reached my ear.\n13 In troubling thoughts during visions of the night,\nWhen deep sleep falls upon men,\n14 A terrible trembling came upon me,\nFilling all my bones with dread.\n15 A spirit passed over my face;\nThe hair of my flesh bristled.\n16 It then stood still,\nBut I did not recognize its appearance.\nA form was in front of my eyes;\nThere was a calm, and then I heard a voice:\n17 'Can a mortal man be more righteous than God?\nCan a man be cleaner than his own Maker?'\n18 Look! He has no faith in his servants,\nAnd he finds fault with his angels.\n19 How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay,\nWhose foundation is in the dust,\nWho are crushed as easily as a moth!\n20 They are completely crushed from morning to evening;\nThey perish forever, and no one takes notice.\n21 Are they not like a tent whose cord is pulled out?\nThey die without wisdom.\nChapter 5\n1 \"Call, please! Is there anyone answering you?\nTo which of the holy ones will you turn?\n2 For resentment will kill the foolish one,\nAnd envy will put the simpleminded to death.\n3 I have seen the foolish one taking root,\nBut suddenly his dwelling place is cursed.\n4 His sons are far from safety,\nAnd they are crushed at the city gate, with no one to save them.\n5 The hungry one eats what he harvests,\nTaking it even from among the thorns,\nAnd their possessions are ensnared.\n6 For harmful things do not sprout from the dust,\nAnd trouble does not spring from the ground.\n7 For man is born for trouble,\nAs surely as sparks fly upward.\n8 But I would appeal to God,\nAnd to God I would submit my case,\n9 To the One doing great and unsearchable things,\nWonderful things without number.\n10 He gives rain to the earth\nAnd sends waters upon the fields.\n11 He raises the lowly up high,\nAnd he raises up the dejected one to salvation.\n12 He frustrates the schemes of the crafty,\nSo that the work of their hands does not succeed.\n13 He catches the wise in their own cunning,\nSo that the plans of the shrewd are thwarted.\n14 They meet with darkness during the day,\nAnd they grope about at midday as if it were night.\n15 He saves from the sword of their mouth,\nSaving the poor from the hand of the strong,\n16 So that there is hope for the lowly,\nBut the mouth of unrighteousness is shut.\n17 Look! Happy is the man whom God reproves;\nSo do not reject the discipline of the Almighty!\n18 For he causes pain, but binds up the wound;\nHe breaks apart, but heals with his own hands.\n19 He will save you from six calamities,\nEven the seventh will not harm you.\n20 During famine he will redeem you from death,\nAnd from the power of a sword during war.\n21 You will be protected from the lash of the tongue,\nAnd you will not fear devastation when it comes.\n22 You will laugh at destruction and hunger,\nAnd you will not fear the wild beasts of the earth.\n23 For the stones of the field will not harm you,\nAnd the wild beasts of the field will be at peace with you.\n24 You will know that your tent is secure,\nAnd nothing will be missing when you inspect your pasture.\n25 You will enjoy many children,\nAnd your descendants will be as plentiful as the vegetation of the earth.\n26 You will still be strong when you go to the grave,\nLike sheaves of grain gathered in their season.\n27 Look! We have investigated this, and it is so.\nListen and accept it.\"\nChapter 6\n1 Job then said in reply:\n2 \"If only my anguish could be fully weighed\nAnd put on scales together with my calamity!\n3 For now it is heavier than the sands of the seas.\nThat is why my words have been wild talk.\n4 For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me,\nAnd my spirit is drinking their venom;\nThe terrors from God are lined up against me.\n5 Will a wild donkey cry out when it has grass,\nOr will a bull bellow when it has fodder?\n6 Is tasteless food eaten without salt,\nOr is there flavor in the juice of a mallow?\n7 I have refused to touch such things.\nThey are like contamination in my food.\n8 O that my request would be realized\nAnd that God would grant my desire!\n9 That God would be willing to crush me,\nAnd that he would reach out his hand and do away with me!\n10 For even that would bring me comfort;\nI would leap for joy despite the unrelenting pain,\nFor I have not denied the sayings of the Holy One.\n11 Do I have the strength to keep waiting?\nAnd what end awaits me, that I should continue to live?\n12 Is my strength like that of rock?\nOr is my flesh made of copper?\n13 Is there any way that I can help myself\nWhen all my means of support has been driven from me?\n14 Anyone who withholds loyal love from his fellow man\nWill forsake the fear of the Almighty.\n15 My own brothers have been as treacherous as a winter stream,\nLike the water of winter streams that dry up.\n16 They are darkened by ice,\nAnd in them the melting snow is hidden.\n17 But in due season they become waterless and come to an end;\nWhen it becomes hot, they dry up.\n18 Their course is diverted;\nThey flow into the desert and vanish.\n19 The caravans of Tema look for them;\nThe travelers from Sheba wait for them.\n20 They are ashamed because of their misplaced trust;\nThey come there only to be disappointed.\n21 For this is how you have become to me;\nYou have seen the terror of my calamity, and you are afraid.\n22 Have I said, 'Give me something,'\nOr requested that you make a gift for me from your wealth?\n23 Have I asked to be rescued from the hand of an enemy\nOr to be saved from oppressors?\n24 Instruct me, and I will be silent;\nHelp me to understand my mistake.\n25 Honest words are not painful!\nBut what benefit can be found in your reproof?\n26 Are you scheming to reprove my words,\nA desperate man's sayings, which the wind blows away?\n27 You would also cast lots over an orphan\nAnd sell your own friend!\n28 So now turn and look at me,\nFor I would not lie to your very faces.\n29 Reconsider, please-do not misjudge me-\nYes, reconsider, for my righteousness is yet intact.\n30 Is my tongue speaking unjustly?\nDoes my palate not discern that something is wrong?\nChapter 7\n1 \"Is not the life of mortal man on earth like compulsory labor,\nAnd are not his days like those of a hired worker?\n2 Like a slave, he longs for the shadow,\nAnd like a hired worker, he waits for his wages.\n3 Thus I have been assigned months of futility\nAnd nights of misery have been counted out for me.\n4 When I lie down I ask, 'When will I get up?'\nBut as the night drags on, I toss restlessly until the dawning of the day.\n5 My flesh is covered with maggots and clods of dirt;\nMy skin is full of scabs and pus.\n6 My days go by more quickly than a weaver's shuttle,\nAnd they come to an end without hope.\n7 Remember that my life is wind,\nThat my eye will never again see happiness.\n8 The eye that sees me now will see me no more;\nYour eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.\n9 Like a cloud that fades and vanishes,\nThe one who goes down to the Grave does not come back up.\n10 He will not return again to his house,\nAnd his place will acknowledge him no more.\n11 Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth.\nI will speak in the anguish of my spirit;\nI will complain in my bitter distress!\n12 Am I the sea or a sea monster,\nThat you should set a guard over me?\n13 When I say, 'My couch will comfort me;\nMy bed will help ease my misery,'\n14 Then you terrify me with dreams\nAnd frighten me with visions,\n15 So that I would choose suffocation,\nYes, death rather than this body of mine.\n16 I loathe my life; I do not want to go on living.\nLeave me alone, for my days are like a breath.\n17 What is mortal man that you should concern yourself with him\nAnd fix your attention on him?\n18 Why do you inspect him every morning\nAnd test him every moment?\n19 Will you not look away from me\nAnd leave me alone long enough to swallow my saliva?\n20 If I have sinned, how could I harm you, the Observer of mankind?\nWhy have you made me your target?\nHave I become a burden to you?\n21 Why do you not pardon my transgression\nAnd excuse my error?\nFor soon I will lie down in the dust,\nAnd you will look for me, but I will be gone.\"\nChapter 8\n1 Bildad the Shuhite then said in reply:\n2 \"How long will you keep speaking like this?\nThe words of your mouth are but a mighty wind!\n3 Will God pervert justice,\nOr will the Almighty pervert righteousness?\n4 If your sons sinned against him,\nHe let them be punished for their revolt;\n5 But if you would just look to God\nAnd plead with the Almighty for favor,\n6 And if you were truly pure and upright,\nHe would pay attention to you\nAnd restore you to your rightful place.\n7 And though your beginning was small,\nYour future would be great.\n8 Ask, please, the former generation,\nAnd pay attention to the things their fathers found out.\n9 For we were born only yesterday, and we know nothing,\nBecause our days on earth are a shadow.\n10 Will they not instruct you\nAnd tell you what they know?\n11 Will a papyrus plant grow tall where there is no marsh?\nWill a reed grow tall without water?\n12 While it is still in the bud, not yet plucked off,\nIt will dry up before any other plant.\n13 This is the outcome of all who forget God,\nFor the hope of the godless will perish,\n14 Whose confidence is in vain\nAnd whose trust is as fragile as a spider's web.\n15 He will lean against his house, but it will not keep standing;\nHe will try to hold on to it, but it will not last.\n16 He is a moist plant in the sunlight,\nAnd his shoots spread out in the garden.\n17 In a heap of stones, his roots become entwined;\nHe looks for a house among the stones.\n18 But when he is uprooted from his place,\nThat place will deny him and say, 'I have never seen you.'\n19 Yes, that is how he will disappear;\nThen others will spring up from the dust.\n20 Surely God will not reject those who keep integrity;\nNor will he support evil men,\n21 For he will yet fill your mouth with laughter\nAnd your lips with shouts of joy.\n22 Those hating you will be clothed with shame,\nAnd the tent of wicked ones will be no more.\"\nChapter 9\n1 Job said in reply:\n2 \"For a fact I know that this is so.\nBut how can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?\n3 If someone wishes to argue with Him,\nThat one could not answer one of His questions in a thousand.\n4 He is wise in heart and mighty in power.\nWho can resist him and come off uninjured?\n5 He moves mountains without anyone knowing it;\nHe overturns them in his anger.\n6 He shakes the earth out of its place,\nSo that its pillars tremble.\n7 He commands the sun not to shine\nAnd seals off the light of the stars;\n8 He spreads out the heavens by himself,\nAnd he treads upon the high waves of the sea.\n9 He made the Ash, the Kesil, and the Kimah constellations,\nAnd the constellations of the southern sky;\n10 He does great and unsearchable things,\nWonderful things that cannot be counted.\n11 He passes by me, and I cannot see him;\nHe moves past me, but I do not discern him.\n12 When he snatches something, who can resist him?\nWho can say to him, 'What are you doing?'\n13 God will not restrain his anger;\nEven the helpers of Rahab will bow down to him.\n14 How much more when I answer him\nMust I choose my words carefully to argue with him!\n15 Even if I were in the right, I would not answer him.\nI could only plead for mercy from my judge.\n16 If I call out to him, will he answer me?\nI do not believe that he will listen to my voice,\n17 For he crushes me with a storm\nAnd multiplies my wounds for no reason.\n18 He does not let me catch my breath;\nHe keeps filling me with bitter things.\n19 If it is a matter of power, he is the strong one.\nIf it is a matter of justice, he says: 'Who can call me to account?'\n20 If I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me;\nEven if I keep my integrity, he will declare me guilty.\n21 Even if I keep my integrity, I am not confident about myself;\nI reject this life of mine.\n22 It is all the same. That is why I say,\n'He destroys the innocent and the wicked alike.'\n23 If a flash flood should cause sudden death,\nHe would mock at the despair of the innocent.\n24 The earth has been handed over to the wicked;\nHe covers the eyes of its judges.\nIf it is not he, then, who is it?\n25 Now my days are swifter than a runner;\nThey run away without seeing good.\n26 They glide by like reed boats,\nLike eagles that swoop down on their prey.\n27 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint,\nI will change my expression and be cheerful,'\n28 I would still be afraid because of all my pains,\nAnd I know you would not find me innocent.\n29 I would be found guilty.\nSo why should I struggle in vain?\n30 If I wash myself in water from melting snow,\nAnd I cleanse my hands in lye,\n31 Then you would dip me in a pit,\nSo that even my own garments would detest me.\n32 For he is not a man like me that I may answer him,\nThat we should go to court together.\n33 There is no person to decide between us,\nWho could serve as our judge.\n34 If he would stop beating me\nAnd not let his terror frighten me,\n35 Then I would speak to him unafraid,\nFor it is not in me to speak out of fear.\nChapter 10\n1 \"I loathe my life.\nI will give vent to my complaints.\nI will speak out in my bitter distress!\n2 I will say to God: 'Do not pronounce me guilty.\nTell me why you are contending with me.\n3 Does it benefit you to oppress,\nTo despise the work of your hands\nWhile you favor the advice of the wicked?\n4 Do you have eyes of flesh,\nOr do you see as mortal man does?\n5 Are your days like the days of mortals,\nOr are your years like those of a man,\n6 That you should search out my error\nAnd keep looking for my sin?\n7 You know that I am not guilty;\nAnd no one can save me from your hand.\n8 Your own hands have shaped me and made me,\nBut now you would completely destroy me.\n9 Remember, please, that you made me out of clay,\nBut now you make me return to dust.\n10 Did you not pour me out like milk\nAnd curdle me like cheese?\n11 With skin and flesh you clothed me,\nAnd with bones and sinews you wove me together.\n12 You have given me life and loyal love;\nYou have guarded my spirit with your care.\n13 But you secretly intended to do these things.\nI know that these things are from you.\n14 If I sinned, you would watch me,\nAnd you would not acquit me of my error.\n15 If I am guilty, too bad for me!\nAnd even if I am innocent, I cannot raise my head,\nFor I am filled with dishonor and affliction.\n16 If I raise my head up, you hunt for me like a lion\nAnd again show your power against me.\n17 You bring new witnesses against me\nAnd increase your anger against me,\nAs hardship after hardship comes upon me.\n18 So why did you bring me out from the womb?\nI should have died before any eye could see me.\n19 It would have been as though I never existed;\nI would have been taken straight from the womb to the grave.'\n20 Are not my days few? Let him leave me alone;\nLet him turn his eyes away from me, so that I may find some relief\n21 Before I go away-and I will not return-\nTo the land of deepest darkness,\n22 To the land of utter gloom,\nA land of deep shadow and disorder,\nWhere even the light is like the gloom.\"\nChapter 11\n1 Zophar the Naamathite said in reply:\n2 \"Will all these words go unanswered,\nOr will a lot of talking make someone right?\n3 Will your empty talk silence people?\nWill no one rebuke you for your mocking words?\n4 For you say, 'My teaching is pure,\nAnd I am clean in your eyes.'\n5 But if only God would speak\nAnd open his lips to you!\n6 Then he would reveal to you the secrets of wisdom,\nFor practical wisdom has many sides.\nThen you would realize that God allows some of your error to be forgotten.\n7 Can you discover the deep things of God\nOr discover everything about the Almighty?\n8 It is higher than heaven. What can you accomplish?\nIt is deeper than the Grave. What can you know?\n9 It is longer than the earth\nAnd broader than the sea.\n10 If he passes by and detains someone and convenes a court,\nWho can resist him?\n11 For he knows when men are deceitful.\nWhen he sees what is evil, will he not take notice?\n12 But an empty-headed man will understand\nOnly when a wild donkey can give birth to a man.\n13 If only you would prepare your heart\nAnd stretch out your hands to him.\n14 If your hand is doing wrong, put it far away,\nAnd let no unrighteousness dwell in your tents.\n15 For then you could lift up your face with no defect;\nYou could stand firm, free of fear.\n16 For then you will forget your trouble;\nYou will remember it as waters that have flowed past you.\n17 Your life will become brighter than midday;\nEven its darkness will be like the morning.\n18 You will be confident because there is hope,\nAnd you will look around and lie down in security.\n19 You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid,\nAnd many people will seek your favor.\n20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail;\nAnd they will find no place to escape,\nAnd their only hope will be death.\"\nChapter 12\n1 Then Job said in reply:\n2 \"Surely you are the people who know,\nAnd wisdom will die out with you!\n3 But I too have understanding.\nI am not inferior to you.\nWho does not know these things?\n4 I have become a laughingstock to my companions,\nOne calling to God for an answer.\nA righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock.\n5 The carefree person has contempt for calamity,\nThinking it is only for those whose feet are unsteady.\n6 The tents of robbers are at peace,\nAnd those who provoke God are secure,\nThose who have their god in their hands.\n7 However, ask, please, the animals, and they will instruct you;\nAlso the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you.\n8 Or give consideration to the earth, and it will instruct you;\nAnd the fish of the sea will declare it to you.\n9 Who among all these does not know\nThat the hand of Jehovah has done this?\n10 In his hand is the life of every living thing\nAnd the spirit of every human.\n11 Does not the ear test out words\nAs the tongue tastes food?\n12 Is not wisdom found among the aged,\nAnd does not understanding come with a long life?\n13 With him there are wisdom and mightiness;\nHe has counsel and understanding.\n14 When he tears something down, it cannot be rebuilt;\nWhat he has shut, no man can open.\n15 When he withholds the waters, everything dries up;\nWhen he sends them out, they overwhelm the earth.\n16 With him there are strength and practical wisdom;\nTo him belong the one going astray and the one leading astray;\n17 He makes counselors go barefoot,\nAnd he makes fools of judges.\n18 He loosens the bonds imposed by kings,\nAnd he binds a belt around their waist.\n19 He makes priests walk barefoot,\nAnd he overthrows those who are firmly established in power;\n20 He deprives trusted advisers of speech\nAnd takes away the sensibleness of old men;\n21 He pours out contempt upon nobles,\nAnd he makes powerful ones weak;\n22 He reveals deep things from the darkness,\nAnd he brings deep darkness into the light;\n23 He makes nations grow great in order to destroy them;\nHe enlarges nations, that he may lead them into exile.\n24 He takes away the understanding of the leaders of the people\nAnd makes them wander in trackless wastelands.\n25 They grope in darkness, where there is no light;\nHe makes them wander about like drunken men.\nChapter 13\n1 \"Yes, my eye has seen all of this,\nMy ear has heard and

with lies;\nAll of you are useless physicians.\n5 If only you would keep absolutely silent,\nThat would show wisdom on your part.\n6 Listen, please, to my arguments,\nAnd pay attention to the pleadings of my lips.\n7 Will you speak unjustly on God's behalf,\nAnd will you speak deceitfully for him?\n8 Will you take his side,\nWill you try to plead the case of the true God?\n9 Would it turn out well if he examined you?\nWill you fool him as you would a mortal man?\n10 He will surely rebuke you\nIf you secretly try to show favoritism.\n11 Will not his very dignity terrify you\nAnd the dread of him fall upon you?\n12 Your wise sayings are proverbs of ashes;\nYour defenses are as fragile as defenses of clay.\n13 Keep silent before me, so that I may speak.\nThen let whatever may come upon me come!\n14 Why do I put myself in danger\nAnd take my life in my hands?\n15 Though he may slay me, I would still wait;\nI would argue my case before his face.\n16 He would then become my salvation,\nFor no godless person may come in before him.\n17 Listen closely to my word;\nPay attention to my declaration.\n18 See, now, I have prepared my legal case;\nI know I am in the right.\n19 Who will contend with me?\nI would die if I were to stay silent!\n20 Only grant two things to me, O God,\nSo that I will not conceal myself from before you:\n21 Remove your heavy hand far away from me,\nAnd do not let the fear of you terrify me.\n22 Either call and I will answer,\nOr let me speak, and you answer me.\n23 What are my errors and sins?\nReveal to me my transgression and my sin.\n24 Why do you hide your face\nAnd consider me your enemy?\n25 Will you try to frighten a windblown leaf\nOr chase after dry stubble?\n26 For you keep recording bitter accusations against me,\nAnd you make me answer for the sins of my youth.\n27 You have put my feet in stocks,\nYou scrutinize all my paths,\nAnd you trace out each of my footprints.\n28 So man decays like something rotten,\nLike a garment eaten by moths.\nChapter 14\n1 \"Man, born of woman,\nIs short-lived and filled with trouble.\n2 He comes up like a blossom and then withers away;\nHe flees like a shadow and disappears.\n3

his months is with you;\nYou have set a limit for him that he may not go beyond.\n6 Turn your gaze away from him so that he may rest,\nUntil, like a hired worker, he finishes out his day.\n7 For there is hope even for a tree.\nIf it is cut down, it will sprout again,\nAnd its twigs will continue to grow.\n8 If its root grows old in the ground\nAnd its stump dies in the soil,\n9 At the scent of water it will sprout;\nAnd it will produce branches like a new plant.\n10 But a man dies and lies powerless;\nWhen a human expires, where is he?\n11 Waters disappear from the sea,\nAnd a river drains away and dries up.\n12 Man also lies down and does not get up.\nUntil heaven is no more, they will not wake up,\nNor will they be aroused from their sleep.\n13 O that in the Grave you would conceal me,\nThat you would hide me until your anger passes by,\nThat you would set a time limit for me and remember me!\n14 If a man dies, can he live again?\nI will wait all the days of my compulsory service\nUntil my relief comes.\n15 You will call, and I will answer you.\nYou will long for the work of your hands.\n16 But for now, you keep counting my every step;\nYou watch only for my sin.\n17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag,\nAnd you seal up my error with glue.\n18 As a mountain falls and crumbles away\nAnd a rock is dislodged from its place,\n19 As water wears away stones\nAnd its torrents wash away earth's soil,\nSo you have destroyed the hope of mortal man.\n20 You keep overpowering him until he perishes;\nYou change his appearance, and you send him away.\n21 His sons are honored, but he does not know it;\nThey become insignificant, but he does not realize it.\n22 He feels pain only while he is still in his flesh;\nHe mourns only while he is still alive.\"\nChapter 15\n1 Eliphaz the Temanite said in reply:\n2 \"Will a wise person answer with empty arguments,\nOr will he fill his belly with the east wind?\n3 Reproving with mere words is useless,\nAnd talk alone

and not I;\nYour own lips testify against you.\n7 Were you the first man ever born,\nOr was your birth before that of the hills?\n8 Do you listen to the confidential talk of God,\nOr do you limit wisdom to yourself?\n9 What do you know that we do not know?\nWhat do you understand that we do not?\n10 Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,\nMen much older than your father.\n11 Are God's consolations not enough for you,\nOr words spoken gently to you?\n12 Why does your heart carry you away,\nAnd why do your eyes flash with anger?\n13 For you turn your spirit against God himself,\nAnd you allow such words to go out of your own mouth.\n14 What is mortal man that he should be pure,\nOr anyone born of a woman that he should be righteous?\n15 Look! He has no faith in his holy ones,\nAnd even the heavens are not pure in his eyes.\n16 How much less so when a person is detestable and corrupt,\nA man who drinks in unrighteousness just like water!\n17 I will inform you; listen to me!\nI will relate what I have seen,\n18 What wise men have related from their fathers,\nThings they have not hidden.\n19 To them alone the land was given,\nAnd no stranger passed among them.\n20 A wicked person suffers torment all his days,\nThroughout all the years reserved for the tyrant.\n21 Terrifying sounds are in his ears;\nIn a time of peace, marauders attack him.\n22 He does not believe that he will escape from darkness;\nHe is reserved for a sword.\n23 He wanders about in search of food-where is it?\nHe well knows that the day of darkness is at hand.\n24 Distress and anguish keep terrifying him;\nThey overpower him like a king ready to launch an attack.\n25 For he raises his hand against God himself\nAnd tries to defy the Almighty;\n26 He stubbornly rushes against Him,\nWith his thick, strong shield;\n27 His face is covered with fat,\nAnd his hips bulge with fat;\n28 He resides in cities that will be brought to ruin,\nIn houses where no one will dwell,\nWhich will become heaps of stones.\n29 He will not grow rich, and his wealth will not accumulate,\nNor will his possessions spread over the land.\n30 He will not escape from darkness;\nA flame will dry up his twig,\nAnd he will pass away by a blast of God's mouth.\n31 He should not go astray and trust in what is worthless,\nFor what he gets in exchange will be worthless;\n32 It will happen before his day,\nAnd his branches will never flourish.\n33 He will be like a vine that shakes off its unripe grapes,\nAnd like an olive tree that casts off its blossoms.\n34 For the assembly of godless ones is sterile,\nAnd fire will consume the tents of bribery.\n35 They conceive trouble and give birth to what is wicked,\nAnd their womb produces deceit.\"\nChapter 16\n1 Job said in reply:\n2 \"I have heard many things like these before.\nAll of you are troublesome comforters!\n3 Is there an end to empty words?\nWhat provokes you to answer

animosity against me.\nHe grinds his teeth against me.\nMy adversary pierces me with his eyes.\n10 They have opened their mouth wide against me,\nAnd they have scornfully struck my cheeks;\nIn large numbers they gather against me.\n11 God hands me over to young boys,\nAnd he thrusts me into the hands of the wicked.\n12 I was untroubled, but he shattered me;\nHe grabbed me by the back of the neck

breach after breach;\nHe rushes at me like a warrior.\n15 I have sewn sackcloth together to cover my skin,\nAnd I have buried my dignity in the dust.\n16 My face is red from weeping,\nAnd on my eyelids is deep shadow,\n17 Although my hands have done no violence\nAnd my prayer is pure.\n18 O earth, do not cover my blood!\nAnd let there be no resting-place for my outcry!\n19 Even now, my

rise?\n4 So how can mortal man be righteous before God,\nOr how can one born of a woman be innocent?\n5 Even the moon is not bright\nAnd the stars are not pure in his eyes,\n6 How much less so mortal man, who is a maggot,\nAnd a son of man, who is a worm!\"\nChapter 26\n1 Job said in reply:\n2 \"How you have helped the one with no power!\nHow you have saved the arm that has no strength!\n3 What great advice you have given to the one lacking wisdom!\nHow freely you have revealed your practical wisdom!\n4 To whom are you trying to speak,\nAnd who inspired you to say such things?\n5 Those who are powerless in death tremble;\nThey are even lower than the waters and their inhabitants.\n6 The Grave is naked in front of God,\nAnd the place of destruction lies uncovered.\n7 He stretches out the northern sky over empty space,\nSuspending the earth upon nothing;\n8 He wraps up the waters in his clouds,\nSo that the clouds do not burst under their weight;\n9 He shuts off the view of his throne,\nSpreading out his cloud over it.\n10 He marks out the horizon on the surface of the waters;\nHe makes a boundary between light and darkness.\n11 The very pillars of heaven shake;\nThey are stunned by his rebuke.\n12 He stirs up the sea with his power,\nAnd by his understanding he breaks the sea monster to pieces.\n13 With his breath he makes the skies clear;\nHis hand pierces the elusive serpent.\n14 Look! These are just the fringes of his ways;\nOnly a faint whisper has been heard of him!\nSo who can understand his mighty thunder?\"\nChapter 27\n1 Job continued his discourse, saying:\n2 \"As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice,\nAs the Almighty lives, who has made me bitter,\n3 As long as my breath is within me\nAnd spirit from God is in my nostrils,\n4 My lips will not speak unrighteousness;\nNor will my tongue mutter deceit!\n5 It is unthinkable for me to declare you men righteous!\nUntil I die, I will not renounce my integrity!\n6 I will maintain my righteousness and never let it go;\nMy heart will not condemn me as long as I live.\n7 May my enemy become like the wicked,\nThose assaulting me like the unrighteous.\n8 For what hope does the godless man have when he is destroyed,\nWhen God takes away his life?\n9 Will God hear his outcry\nWhen distress comes upon him?\n10 Or will he find delight in the Almighty?\nWill he call on God at all times?\n11 I will teach you about the power of God;\nI will not hide anything about the Almighty.\n12 Look! If you have all seen visions,\nWhy are your speeches completely empty?\n13 This is the wicked man's share from God,\nThe inheritance that tyrants receive from the Almighty.\n14 If his sons become many, they will fall by the sword,\nAnd his descendants will not have enough food.\n15 Those who survive him will be buried by the plague,\nAnd their widows will not weep for them.\n16 Even if he piles up silver like the dust\nAnd stores up fine clothing like the clay,\n17 Though he may gather it,\nThe righteous man will wear it,\nAnd the innocent will divide up his silver.\n18 The house he builds is as fragile as a moth's cocoon,\nLike a shelter made by a watchman.\n19 He will go to bed rich but will gather nothing;\nWhen he opens his eyes, nothing will be there.\n20 Terror overtakes him like a flood;\nA storm snatches him away by night.\n21 An east wind will carry him off, and he will be gone;\nIt sweeps him away from his place.\n22 It will hurl itself at him without pity\nAs he desperately tries to flee from its force.\n23 It claps its hands at him\nAnd whistles at him from its place.\nChapter 28\n1 \"There is a place to mine silver\nAnd a place for gold that they refine;\n2 Iron is taken from the ground,\nAnd copper is smelted from rocks.\n3 Man conquers the darkness;\nHe probes to the limit in the gloom and darkness,\nSearching for ore.\n4 He sinks a shaft far from where people reside,\nIn forgotten places, far from where people walk;\nSome men descend and swing suspended.\n5 Food grows on top of the earth;\nBut below, there is an upheaval as if by fire.\n6 There in the stones is sapphire,\nAnd the dust contains gold.\n7 No bird of prey knows the path to it;\nThe eye of a black kite has not seen it.\n8 No majestic beasts have trodden on it;\nThe young lion has not prowled there.\n9 Man strikes the flinty rock with his hand;\nHe overturns the mountains at their foundation.\n10 He cuts water channels in the rock;\nHis eyes spot every precious thing.\n11 He dams up the sources of rivers\nAnd brings what was hidden to the light.\n12 But wisdom-where can it be found,\nAnd where is the source of understanding?\n13 No man recognizes its value,\nAnd it cannot be found in the land of the living.\n14 The deep waters say, 'It is not in me!'\nAnd the sea says, 'It is not with me!'\n15 It cannot be bought with pure gold;\nNor can silver be weighed out in exchange for it.\n16 It cannot be bought with gold of Ophir\nNor with rare onyx and sapphire.\n17 Gold and glass cannot be compared to it;\nNor can a vessel of fine gold be exchanged for it.\n18 Coral and crystal are not worthy of mention,\nFor a bagful of wisdom is worth more than one full of pearls.\n19 The topaz of Cush cannot be compared to it;\nIt cannot be purchased even with pure gold.\n20 But from where does wisdom come,\nAnd where is the source of understanding?\n21 It has been hidden from the eyes of every living thing\nAnd concealed from the birds of the heavens.\n22 Destruction and death say,\n'Our ears have heard only a report of it.'\n23 God understands the way to find it;\nHe alone knows where it resides,\n24 For he looks to the ends of the earth,\nAnd he sees everything under the heavens.\n25 When he set the force of the wind\nAnd measured out the waters,\n26 When he made a regulation for the rain\nAnd a path for the thunderous storm cloud,\n27 Then he saw wisdom and explained it;\nHe established and tested it.\n28 And he said to man:\n'Look! The fear of Jehovah-that is wisdom,\nAnd to turn away from bad is understanding.'\"\nChapter 29\n1 Job continued his discourse, saying:\n2 \"If only I were in the months gone by,\nIn the days when God was watching over me,\n3 When he caused his lamp to shine upon my head,\nWhen I walked through darkness by his light,\n4 When I was in my prime,\nWhen God's friendship was felt in my tent,\n5 When the Almighty was still with me,\nWhen my children were all around me,\n6 When my steps were awash in butter,\nAnd the rocks poured out streams of oil for me.\n7 When I used to go out to the city gate\nAnd take my seat in the public square,\n8 The young men would see me and step aside,\nAnd even the old men would rise and remain standing.\n9 Princes refrained from speaking;\nThey would put their hand over their mouth.\n10 The voices of the prominent men were silenced;\nTheir tongue was stuck to the roof of their mouth.\n11 Whoever heard me would speak well of me,\nAnd those who saw me would testify for me.\n12 For I would rescue the poor who cried for help,\nAlong with the fatherless child and anyone who had no helper.\n13 The one about to perish would bless me,\nAnd I made the heart of the widow rejoice.\n14 I put on righteousness as my clothing;\nMy justice was like a robe and a turban.\n15 I became eyes to the blind\nAnd feet to the lame.\n16 I was a father to the poor;\nI would investigate the legal case of those I did not know.\n17 I would break the jaws of the wrongdoer\nAnd tear the prey away from his teeth.\n18 I used to say, 'I will die in my own home,\nAnd my days will be as numerous as the grains of sand.\n19 My roots will spread out into the waters,\nAnd dew will stay all night on my branches.\n20 My glory is constantly renewed,\nAnd the bow in my hand will keep shooting.'\n21 People would listen expectantly,\nWaiting in silence for my advice.\n22 After I had spoken, they had nothing more to say;\nMy words would fall gently on their ears.\n23 They waited for me as for the rain;\nThey opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.\n24 When I smiled at them, they could hardly believe it;\nThe light of my face would reassure them.\n25 I gave them direction as their head,\nAnd I lived like a king among his troops,\nLike one who comforts the mourners.\nChapter 30\n1 \"Now they laugh at me\n-Men younger than I am,\nWhose fathers I would have refused\nTo put with the dogs that guarded my flock.\n2 Of what use was the power of their hands to me?\nTheir vigor has perished.\n3 They are worn out from want and hunger;\nThey gnaw at the parched ground\nThat was already ruined and desolated.\n4 They gather the salt herb from the bushes;\nTheir food is the root of broom trees.\n5 They are driven out of the community;\nPeople shout at them as they would at a thief.\n6 They live on the slopes of ravines,\nIn holes in the ground and in the rocks.\n7 From the bushes they cry out\nAnd huddle together among the nettles.\n8 As sons of the senseless and the nameless ones,\nThey have been driven out of the land.\n9 But now they mock me even in their songs;\nI have become an object of scorn to them.\n10 They detest me and keep their distance from me;\nThey do not hesitate to spit in my face.\n11 Because God has disarmed me and humbled me,\nThey throw off all restraint in my presence.\n12 On my right they rise up like a mob;\nThey put me to flight\nAnd put up barriers of destruction in my path.\n13 They tear up my roadways\nAnd make my calamity worse,\nWithout anyone to stop them.\n14 They come as if through a wide breach in the wall;\nThey roll in amid the devastation.\n15 Terror overwhelms me;\nMy dignity is driven away like the wind,\nAnd my salvation vanishes like a cloud.\n16 Now my life ebbs from me;\nDays of affliction take hold of me.\n17 Aching pierces my bones at night;\nThe gnawing pain never stops.\n18 With great force my garment is disfigured;\nLike the collar of my garment, it chokes me.\n19 God has thrown me down into the mud;\nI am reduced to dust and ashes.\n20 I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me;\nI stand up, but you just look at me.\n21 You have cruelly turned against me;\nWith the full might of your hand, you assault me.\n22 You pick me up and carry me off with the wind;\nThen you toss me about in the storm.\n23 For I know that you will bring me down to death,\nTo the house where everyone living will meet.\n24 But no one would strike at a broken man\nAs he cries for help during his time of disaster.\n25 Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times?\nHave I not grieved for the poor?\n26 Although I hoped for good, bad came;\nI expected the light, but darkness came.\n27 The churning inside me did not stop;\nDays of affliction confronted me.\n28 I walk about gloomy; there is no sunlight.\nIn the assembly, I rise and cry for help.\n29 I have become a brother to jackals\nAnd a companion to the daughters of the ostrich.\n30 My skin has blackened and fallen off;\nMy bones burn from the heat.\n31 My harp is used only for mourning,\nAnd my flute for the sound of weeping.\nChapter 31\n1 \"I have made a covenant with my eyes.\nSo how could I show improper attention to a virgin?\n2 What, then, would be my share from God above,\nWhat inheritance from the Almighty on high?\n3 Does not disaster await the wrongdoer\nAnd calamity those doing what is harmful?\n4 Does he not see my ways\nAnd count all my steps?\n5 Have I ever walked in untruth?\nHas my foot hurried to deceive?\n6 Let God weigh me with accurate scales;\nThen he will recognize my integrity.\n7 If my footsteps deviate from the way\nOr my heart has followed after my eyes\nOr my hands have been defiled,\n8 Then let me sow seed and someone else eat,\nAnd let what I plant be uprooted.\n9 If my heart has been enticed by a woman\nAnd I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door,\n10 Then let my wife grind grain for another man,\nAnd let other men have sexual relations with her.\n11 For that would be shameful conduct,\nAn error deserving punishment by the judges.\n12 It would be a fire that would devour and destroy,\nConsuming even the roots of all my produce.\n13 If I denied justice to my male or female servants\nWhen they had a complaint against me,\n14 What can I do when God confronts me?\nWhat can I answer him when he calls for an accounting?\n15 Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them?\nWas it not the same One who formed us before our birth?\n16 If I refused to give the poor what they desired\nOr saddened the eyes of the widow;\n17 If I ate my portion of food alone\nWithout sharing it with the orphans;\n18 (For from my youth the orphan grew up with me as though I were his father,\nAnd I have been a guide for the widow from childhood.)\n19 If I saw anyone perishing for lack of clothing\nOr a poor man with nothing to cover himself;\n20 If he did not bless me\nAs he warmed himself with the wool of my sheep;\n21 If I shook my fist against the orphan\nWhen he needed my assistance in the city gate;\n22 Then let my arm fall from my shoulder,\nAnd let my arm be broken at the elbow.\n23 For I dreaded disaster from God,\nAnd I could not stand before his dignity.\n24 If I put my confidence in gold\nOr said to fine gold, 'You are my security!'\n25 If I found my joy in my great wealth\nBecause of the many possessions I acquired;\n26 If I saw the sun shining\nOr the moon moving in its splendor;\n27 And my heart was secretly enticed,\nAnd my mouth kissed my hand in worship of them;\n28 Then that would be an error deserving punishment by the judges,\nFor I would have denied the true God above.\n29 Have I ever rejoiced over the destruction of my enemy\nOr gloated because evil befell him?\n30 I never allowed my mouth to sin\nBy asking for his life in an oath.\n31 Have the men of my tent not said,\n'Who can find anyone who has not been satisfied with his food?'\n32 No stranger had to spend the night outside;\nI opened my doors to the traveler.\n33 Have I ever tried to cover over my transgressions, like other men,\nBy hiding my error in the pocket of my garment?\n34 Have I been in fear of the reaction of the multitude,\nOr have I been terrified by the contempt of other families,\nMaking me silent and afraid to go outside?\n35 If only someone would listen to me!\nI would sign my name to what I have said.\nLet the Almighty answer me!\nIf only my accuser had written out the charges in a document!\n36 I would carry it on my shoulder,\nAnd I would bind it around my head like a crown.\n37 I would give him an accounting for every step I took;\nI would approach him confidently, like a prince.\n38 If my own ground would cry out against me\nAnd its furrows would weep together;\n39 If I have eaten its fruitage without payment,\nOr if I have caused its owners to despair;\n40 Then let thorns sprout for me instead of wheat\nAnd foul-smelling weeds instead of barley.\"\nThe words of Job end here.\nChapter 32\n1 So these three men stopped trying to answer Job, because he was convinced of his own righteousness. 2 But Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the family of Ram had become very angry. His anger blazed against Job for trying to prove himself right rather than God. 3 He was also very angry with Job's three companions because they could not find an answer but had declared God wicked. 4 Elihu had been waiting to respond to Job, because they were older than he was. 5 When Elihu saw that the three men had nothing to say in answer, his anger flared up. 6 So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite began to speak, saying:\n\"I am young\nAnd you men are aged.\nSo I respectfully held back,\nAnd I dared not tell you what I know.\n7 I thought, 'Let age speak,\nAnd let a multitude of years declare wisdom.'\n8 But it is the spirit in people,\nThe breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.\n9 Age alone does not make one wise,\nNor is it only old men who understand what is right.\n10 So I say, 'Listen to me,\nAnd I will also tell you what I know.'\n11 Look! I have waited for your words;\nI kept listening to your reasoning\nAs you searched for things to say.\n12 I paid close attention to you,\nBut none of you could prove Job wrong\nOr answer his arguments.\n13 So do not say, 'We have found wisdom;\nIt is God who refutes him, not a man.'\n14 He did not direct his words against me,\nSo I will not reply to him with your arguments.\n15 They are dismayed, they have no more answers;\nThey have nothing left to say.\n16 I have waited, but they do not continue speaking;\nThey just stand there, with no further answer.\n17 So I too will give an answer;\nI too will tell what I know,\n18 For I am full of words;\nThe spirit within me compels me.\n19 My insides are like wine that has no vent,\nLike new wineskins ready to burst.\n20 Let me speak so that I can find relief!\nI will open my lips and give an answer.\n21 I will not show partiality to anyone;\nNor will I flatter any human,\n22 For I do not know how to flatter;\nIf I did, my Maker would quickly do away with me.\nChapter 33\n1 \"But now, Job, please hear my words;\nListen to everything I say.\n2 Look, please! I must open my mouth;\nMy tongue must speak.\n3 My words declare the uprightness of my heart,\nAnd my lips sincerely tell what I know.\n4 God's own spirit made me,\nAnd the Almighty's own breath brought me to life.\n5 Reply to me if you are able;\nPresent your arguments before me; take your position.\n6 Look! I am just like you before the true God;\nFrom the clay I too was shaped.\n7 So no fear of me should terrify you,\nAnd no pressure from me should overwhelm you.\n8 But you said in my hearing,\nYes, I kept hearing these words,\n9 'I am pure, without transgression;\nI am clean, without error.\n10 But God finds reasons to oppose me;\nHe considers me his enemy.\n11 He puts my feet in stocks;\nHe scrutinizes all my paths.'\n12 But you are not right in saying this, so I will answer you:\nGod is far greater than mortal man.\n13 Why do you complain against Him?\nIs it because he did not answer all your words?\n14 For God speaks once and a second time,\nBut no one pays attention,\n15 In a dream, a vision of the night,\nWhen deep sleep falls upon people\nWhile they sleep in their beds.\n16 Then he uncovers their ears\nAnd impresses his instruction upon them,\n17 To turn a person away from wrongdoing\nAnd to protect a man from pride.\n18 God spares his soul from the pit,\nHis life from perishing by the sword.\n19 A person is also reproved by pain on his bed\nAnd by the constant distress of his bones,\n20 So that his very being loathes bread,\nAnd he rejects even fine food.\n21 His flesh wastes away from sight,\nAnd his bones that were hidden now protrude.\n22 His soul draws near to the pit;\nHis life to those who bring death.\n23 If there is a messenger for him,\nOne advocate out of a thousand,\nTo tell to man what is upright,\n24 Then God shows him favor and says,\n'Spare him from going down into the pit!\nI have found a ransom!\n25 Let his flesh become fresher than in youth;\nLet him return to the days of his youthful vigor.'\n26 He will entreat God, who will accept him,\nAnd he will see His face with shouts of joy,\nAnd He will restore His righteousness to mortal man.\n27 That person will declare to men,\n'I have sinned and distorted what is right,\nBut I did not receive what I deserved.\n28 He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit,\nAnd my life will see the light.'\n29 Indeed, God does all these things\nTwice, three times, for a man,\n30 To bring him back from the pit,\nSo that he may be enlightened with the light of life.\n31 Pay attention, Job! Listen to me!\nKeep silent, and I will continue speaking.\n32 If you have something to say, reply to me.\nSpeak, for I want to prove you right.\n33 If you have nothing to say, you should listen to me;\nKeep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.\"\nChapter 34\n1 So Elihu continued to say in reply:\n2 \"Listen to my words, you who are wise;\nHear me, you who know so much.\n3 For the ear tests words\nJust as the tongue tastes food.\n4 Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right;\nLet us decide among ourselves what is good.\n5 For Job has said, 'I am in the right,\nBut God has denied me justice.\n6 Would I lie about what my own judgment should be?\nMy wound is incurable, though there is no transgression.'\n7 What other man is like Job,\nWho drinks up derision like water?\n8 He is in company with wrongdoers\nAnd in association with wicked men.\n9 For he has said, 'A man does not benefit\nFrom trying to please God.'\n10 So listen to me, you men of understanding:\nIt is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly,\nFor the Almighty to do wrong!\n11 For he will reward a man according to what he does\nAnd bring upon him the consequences of his ways.\n12 For a certainty, God does not act wickedly;\nThe Almighty does not pervert justice.\n13 Who put him in charge of the earth,\nAnd who appointed him over the whole world?\n14 If he fixes his attention on them,\nIf he gathers their spirit and breath to himself,\n15 All humans would perish together,\nAnd mankind would return to the dust.\n16 So if you have understanding, pay attention to this;\nListen carefully to what I say.\n17 Should someone who hates justice be in control,\nOr would you condemn a powerful one who is righteous?\n18 Would you say to a king, 'You are good for nothing,'\nOr to nobles, 'You are wicked'?\n19 There is One who does not show partiality to princes\nAnd who does not favor the rich over the poor,\nFor they are all the work of his hands.\n20 They may die suddenly, in the middle of the night;\nThey shake violently and pass away;\nEven the powerful are removed, but not by human hands.\n21 For God's eyes are upon the ways of a man,\nAnd He sees all his steps.\n22 There is no darkness or deep shadow\nWhere wrongdoers can conceal themselves.\n23 For God has not set an appointed time for any man\nTo appear before him in judgment.\n24 He breaks the powerful without needing to investigate\nAnd sets up others in their place.\n25 For he knows what they are doing;\nHe overthrows them during the night, and they are crushed.\n26 He strikes them for their wickedness,\nIn a place where all can see,\n27 Because they have turned away from following him\nAnd have no regard for any of his ways;\n28 They cause the poor to cry out to him,\nSo that he hears the outcry of the helpless.\n29 When God remains silent, who can condemn him?\nWhen he hides his face, who can see him?\nWhether toward a nation or a man, the result is the same,\n30 So that a godless person may not rule\nOr lay snares for the people.\n31 For will anyone say to God,\n'I have been punished, although I have committed no offense;\n32 Teach me what I have failed to see;\nIf I have done anything wrong, I will not do it again'?\n33 Should he reward you on your terms when you reject his judgment?\nYou must decide, not I.\nSo tell me what you know so well.\n34 Men of understanding will say to me\n-Any wise man who hears me-\n35 'Job speaks without knowledge,\nAnd his words lack insight.'\n36 Let Job be tested to the limit\nBecause his replies are like those of wicked men!\n37 He adds rebellion to his sin;\nHe scornfully claps his hands before us\nAnd multiplies his words against the true God!\"\nChapter 35\n1 Elihu continued his response:\n2 \"Are you so convinced that you are right that you would say,\n'I am more righteous than God'?\n3 For you say, 'What does it matter to you?\nAm I better off than if I had sinned?'\n4 I will reply to you\nAnd to your companions with you.\n5 Look up to heaven and see,\nObserve the clouds, which are high above you.\n6 If you sin, how do you hurt him?\nIf your transgressions multiply, what do you do to him?\n7 If you are righteous, what do you give him;\nWhat does he receive from you?\n8 Your wickedness affects only a human like yourself,\nAnd your righteousness, a son of man.\n9 People cry out when under great oppression;\nThey cry for relief from the domination of the powerful.\n10 But no one says, 'Where is God, my Grand Maker,\nThe one causing songs to be sung in the night?'\n11 He teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,\nAnd he makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens.\n12 People cry out, but he does not answer,\nBecause of the pride of the wicked.\n13 Surely God does not hear an empty cry;\nThe Almighty does not pay attention to it.\n14 How much less, then, when you complain that you do not see him!\nYour legal case is before him, so you should wait anxiously for him.\n15 For he has not angrily called for an accounting;\nNor has he taken note of your extreme rashness.\n16 Job opens his mouth wide in vain;\nHe multiplies words without knowledge.\"\nChapter 36\n1 Elihu continued:\n2 \"Be patient with me a little longer while I explain,\nFor I still have words to speak on God's behalf.\n3 I will speak comprehensively about what I know,\nAnd I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.\n4 Truly my words are not false;\nThe One perfect in knowledge is here before you.\n5 Indeed, God is mighty and rejects no one;\nHe is great in his power of understanding.\n6 He will not preserve the lives of the wicked,\nBut he gives justice to the afflicted.\n7 He does not take his eyes off the righteous;\nHe enthrones them with kings, and they are exalted forever.\n8 But if they are bound in shackles\nAnd caught in ropes of affliction,\n9 He reveals to them what they have done,\nTheir transgressions caused by their pride.\n10 He opens their ears to correction\nAnd tells them to turn away from wrongdoing.\n11 If they obey and serve him,\nThey will live out their days in prosperity,\nAnd their years will be pleasant.\n12 But if they do not obey, they will perish by the sword\nAnd die without knowledge.\n13 The godless at heart will harbor resentment.\nThey do not cry for help even when he binds them.\n14 They die while still young,\nSpending their life among male temple prostitutes.\n15 But God rescues the afflicted during their affliction;\nHe opens their ear when they are oppressed.\n16 He draws you away from the brink of distress\nTo a broad space, free of restriction,\nWith rich food on your table as consolation.\n17 Then you will be satisfied with the judgment on the wicked,\nWhen judgment is rendered and justice is upheld.\n18 But take care that rage does not lead you into spitefulness,\nAnd do not let a large bribe lead you astray.\n19 Would your cry for help\nOr any of your strenuous efforts keep you from distress?\n20 Do not long for the night,\nWhen people vanish from their place.\n21 Beware that you do not turn to wrongdoing,\nChoosing this instead of affliction.\n22 Look! God is exalted in his power;\nWhat instructor is like him?\n23 Who has directed his way\nOr said to him, 'What you have done is wrong'?\n24 Remember to magnify his activity,\nOf which men have sung.\n25 All mankind has seen it,\nMortal man looks on from a distance.\n26 Yes, God is greater than we can know;\nThe number of his years is beyond comprehension.\n27 He draws up the drops of water;\nThey condense into rain from his mist;\n28 Then the clouds pour it down;\nThey shower down upon mankind.\n29 Can anyone understand the layers of clouds,\nThe thundering from his tent?\n30 See how he spreads his lightning over it\nAnd covers the depths of the sea.\n31 By these he sustains the peoples;\nHe gives them food in abundance.\n32 With his hands he covers the lightning,\nAnd he directs it against its target.\n33 His thunder tells about him,\nEven the livestock tell who is coming.\nChapter 37\n1 \"At this my heart pounds\nAnd leaps from its place.\n2 Listen carefully to the rumbling of his voice\nAnd the thunder that comes from his mouth.\n3 He unleashes it under the entire heavens\nAnd sends his lightning to the ends of the earth.\n4 After that is a roaring sound;\nHe thunders with a majestic voice,\nAnd he does not hold it back when his voice is heard.\n5 God thunders with his voice in a wonderful way;\nHe does great things that are beyond our understanding.\n6 For he says to the snow, 'Fall to the earth,'\nAnd to the downpour of rain, 'Pour down mightily.'\n7 God puts a stop to all human activity\nSo that every mortal man will know His work.\n8 The wild animals go into their dens\nAnd remain in their lairs.\n9 The storm wind blows from its chamber,\nAnd the cold comes from the north winds.\n10 By the breath of God, the ice is produced,\nAnd the broad waters are frozen solid.\n11 Yes, he weighs down the clouds with moisture;\nHe scatters his lightning in the clouds;\n12 They swirl around where he directs them;\nThey carry out whatever he commands on the surface of the inhabited earth.\n13 Whether it is for punishment or for the sake of the land\nOr for loyal love, he causes it to happen.\n14 Listen to this, Job;\nStop and consider carefully the wonderful works of God.\n15 Do you know how God controls the clouds\nAnd how he causes the lightning to flash from his cloud?\n16 Do you know how the clouds float?\nThese are the wonderful works of the One perfect in knowledge.\n17 Why does your clothing become hot\nWhen the earth is still because of the south wind?\n18 Can you, with him, spread out the skies\nAs solid as a metal mirror?\n19 Tell us what we should say to him;\nWe cannot answer because we are in the dark.\n20 Should he be told that I want to speak?\nOr has anyone said something that should be communicated to him?\n21 They cannot even see the light,\nThough it is bright in the sky,\nUntil a wind passes by and clears away the clouds.\n22 Out of the north comes golden splendor;\nGod's majesty is awe-inspiring.\n23 Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach;\nHe is great in power,\nAnd he never violates his justice and abundant righteousness.\n24 Therefore, people should fear him.\nFor he does not favor any who think that they are wise.\"\nChapter 38\n1 Then Jehovah answered Job out of the windstorm:\n2 \"Who is this who is obscuring my counsel\nAnd speaking without knowledge?\n3 Brace yourself, please, like a man;\nI will question you, and you inform me.\n4 Where were you when I founded the earth?\nTell me, if you think you understand.\n5 Who set its measurements, in case you know,\nOr who stretched a measuring line across it?\n6 Into what were its pedestals sunk,\nOr who laid its cornerstone,\n7 When the morning stars joyfully cried out together,\nAnd all the sons of God began shouting in applause?\n8 And who barricaded the sea behind doors\nWhen it burst out from the womb,\n9 When I clothed it with clouds\nAnd wrapped it in thick gloom,\n10 When I established my limit for it\nAnd put its bars and doors in place,\n11 And I said, 'You may come this far, and no farther;\nHere is where your proud waves will stop'?\n12 Have you ever commanded the morning\nOr made the dawn know its place,\n13 To take hold of the ends of the earth\nAnd to shake the wicked out of it?\n14 It is transformed like clay under a seal,\nAnd its features stand out like those of a garment.\n15 But the light of the wicked is held back from them,\nAnd their uplifted arm is broken.\n16 Have you gone down to the sources of the sea\nOr explored the deep waters?\n17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you,\nOr have you seen the gates of deep darkness?\n18 Have you understood the vast expanse of the earth?\nTell me, if you know all of this.\n19 In which direction does the light reside?\nAnd where is the place of darkness,\n20 That you should take it to its territory\nAnd understand the paths to its home?\n21 Do you know this because you were already born\nAnd the number of your years is great?\n22 Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,\nOr have you seen the storehouses of the hail,\n23 Which I have reserved for the time of distress,\nFor the day of battle and war?\n24 From what direction is light dispersed,\nAnd from where does the east wind blow on the earth?\n25 Who has cut a channel for the flood\nAnd made a path for the thunderous storm cloud,\n26 To make it rain where no man lives,\nOn the wilderness where there are no humans,\n27 To satisfy devastated wastelands\nAnd cause the grass to sprout?\n28 Does the rain have a father,\nOr who fathered the dewdrops?\n29 From whose womb did the ice emerge,\nAnd who gave birth to the frost of heaven\n30 When the waters are covered as if with stone,\nAnd the surface of the deep waters is frozen solid?\n31 Can you tie the ropes of the Kimah constellation\nOr untie the cords of the Kesil constellation?\n32 Can you lead out a constellation in its season\nOr guide the Ash constellation along with its sons?\n33 Do you know the laws governing the heavens,\nOr can you impose their authority on the earth?\n34 Can you raise your voice to the clouds\nTo cause a flood of water to cover you?\n35 Can you send out lightning bolts?\nWill they come and say to you, 'Here we are!'\n36 Who put wisdom within the clouds\nOr gave understanding to the sky phenomenon?\n37 Who is wise enough to count the clouds,\nOr who can tip over the water jars of heaven\n38 When the dust pours into a mass\nAnd the clods of earth stick together?\n39 Can you hunt prey for a lion\nOr satisfy the appetites of young lions\n40 When they crouch in their lairs\nOr lie in ambush in their dens?\n41 Who prepares food for the raven\nWhen its young cry to God for help\nAnd wander about because there is nothing to eat?\nChapter 39\n1 \"Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?\nHave you watched the deer give birth to their young?\n2 Do you count the months that they must complete?\nDo you know the time when they give birth?\n3 They crouch down when they give birth to their young,\nAnd their labor pains end.\n4 Their young become strong and grow up in the open field;\nThey go out and do not return to them.\n5 Who set the wild donkey free,\nAnd who untied the ropes of the wild donkey?\n6 I have made the desert plain its home\nAnd the salt land its dwelling.\n7 It scorns the tumult of the city;\nIt does not hear the shouts of the driver.\n8 It roams the hills, seeking pasture,\nLooking for every green plant.\n9 Is the wild bull willing to serve you?\nWill it spend the night in your stable?\n10 Will you hold a wild bull to the furrow with a rope,\nOr will it follow you to plow the valley?\n11 Will you trust in its great strength\nAnd let it do your heavy work?\n12 Will you rely on it to bring back your harvest,\nAnd will it gather it to your threshing floor?\n13 The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,\nBut can her pinions and plumage compare with the stork's?\n14 For she leaves her eggs on the ground,\nAnd she keeps them warm in the dust.\n15 She forgets that some foot may crush them\nOr that a wild animal may trample them.\n16 She treats her sons harshly, as if they were not hers;\nShe has no fear that her labor may be in vain.\n17 For God has deprived her of wisdom\nAnd given her no share in understanding.\n18 But when she rises up and flaps her wings,\nShe laughs at the horse and at its rider.\n19 Are you the one who gives the horse its strength?\nDo you clothe its neck with a rustling mane?\n20 Can you cause it to leap like a locust?\nIts majestic snorting is terrifying.\n21 It paws the ground in the valley and exults mightily;\nIt charges into the battle.\n22 It laughs at fear and is afraid of nothing.\nIt does not turn back because of the sword.\n23 The quiver rattles against it,\nThe spear and the javelin flash.\n24 Trembling with excitement, it surges forward,\nIt cannot stand still at the sound of the horn.\n25 When the horn blows, it says, 'Aha!'\nIt smells the battle from afar\nAnd hears the shouting of commanders and the battle cry.\n26 Is it by your understanding that the falcon soars,\nSpreading its wings to the south?\n27 Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward\nAnd builds its nest high up,\n28 Spending the night on a cliff,\nDwelling in its stronghold on a rocky crag?\n29 From there it searches for food;\nIts eyes look far into the distance.\n30 Its young sip up blood;\nAnd wherever the slain are, there it is.\"\nChapter 40\n1 Jehovah continued to answer Job:\n2 \"Should a faultfinder contend with the Almighty?\nLet the one who wants to reprove God answer.\"\n3 Job said in answer to Jehovah:\n4 \"Look! I am unworthy.\nWhat can I reply to you?\nI put my hand over my mouth.\n5 I spoke once, but I will not answer again;\nTwice, but I will say no more.\"\n6 Then Jehovah answered Job out of the windstorm:\n7 \"Brace yourself, please, like a man;\nI will question you, and you inform me.\n8 Will you call into question my justice?\nWill you condemn me so that you may be right?\n9 Do you have an arm as powerful as the true God's,\nOr can your voice thunder like his?\n10 Adorn yourself, please, with glory and majesty;\nClothe yourself with dignity and splendor.\n11 Release the fury of your anger;\nLook at everyone who is haughty, and bring him low.\n12 Look at everyone who is haughty, and humble him,\nAnd tread down the wicked where they stand.\n13 Hide them all in the dust;\nBind them in the hidden place,\n14 Then even I would acknowledge to you\nThat your right hand can save you.\n15 Here, now, is Behemoth, which I made as I made you.\nIt eats grass like a bull.\n16 Look at the strength in its hips\nAnd the power in the muscles of its belly!\n17 It stiffens its tail like a cedar;\nThe sinews of its thighs are woven together.\n18 Its bones are tubes of copper;\nIts limbs are like wrought-iron rods.\n19 It ranks first among the works of God;\nOnly its Maker can approach it with his sword.\n20 For the mountains produce food for it,\nWhere all the wild animals play.\n21 It lies down under the lotus trees,\nIn the shelter of the reeds of the marsh.\n22 The lotus trees cast their shadow on it,\nAnd the poplars of the valley surround it.\n23 If the river is turbulent, it does not panic.\nIt is confident, although the Jordan rushes against its mouth.\n24 Can anyone capture it while it is watching,\nOr pierce its nose with a hook?\nChapter 41\n1 \"Can you catch Leviathan with a fishhook\nOr hold down its tongue with a rope?\n2 Can you put a rope through its nostrils\nOr pierce its jaws with a hook?\n3 Will it make many pleas to you,\nOr will it speak gently to you?\n4 Will it make a covenant with you,\nSo that you may make it your slave for life?\n5 Will you play with it as with a bird\nOr tie it on a leash for your little girls?\n6 Will traders barter for it?\nWill they divide it up among merchants?\n7 Will you fill its hide with harpoons\nOr its head with fishing spears?\n8 Lay your hand on it;\nYou will remember the battle and never do it again!\n9 Any hope of subduing it is futile.\nThe mere sight of it would overwhelm you.\n10 No one dares to stir it up.\nSo who is it who can stand up to me?\n11 Who has given me anything first that I should repay him?\nWhatever is under the heavens is mine.\n12 I will not be silent about its limbs,\nAbout its mightiness and its well-formed body.\n13 Who has removed its outer covering?\nWho will enter its open jaws?\n14 Who can pry open the doors of its mouth?\nIts teeth all around are fearsome.\n15 Its back has rows of scales\nTightly sealed together.\n16 Each one fits so closely to the other\nThat no air can come between them.\n17 They are stuck to one another;\nThey cling together and cannot be separated.\n18 Its snorting flashes out light,\nAnd its eyes are like the rays of dawn.\n19 Flashes of lightning go out of its mouth;\nFiery sparks escape.\n20 Smoke pours out of its nostrils,\nLike a furnace fueled with rushes.\n21 Its breath sets coals ablaze,\nAnd a flame shoots from its mouth.\n22 There is great strength in its neck,\nAnd dismay runs before it.\n23 The folds of its flesh are tightly joined together;\nThey are firm, as though cast upon it and immovable.\n24 Its heart is hard as stone,\nYes, hard as a lower millstone.\n25 When it rises up, even the mighty are frightened;\nIts thrashing causes bewilderment.\n26 No sword that reaches it will prevail;\nNor will spear, dart, or arrowhead.\n27 It regards iron as straw,\nCopper as rotten wood.\n28 An arrow does not make it flee;\nSlingstones turn into stubble against it.\n29 It regards a club as stubble,\nAnd it laughs at the rattling of a javelin.\n30 Underneath, it is like sharp fragments of pottery;\nIt spreads itself in the mud like a threshing sledge.\n31 It makes the deep boil just like a pot;\nIt stirs up the sea like an ointment pot.\n32 It leaves a glistening wake in its path.\nOne would think that the deep had white hair.\n33 There is nothing like it on the earth,\nA creature made to have no fear.\n34 It glares at everything that is haughty.\nIt is king over all the majestic wild beasts.\"\nChapter 42\n1 Then Job said in reply to Jehovah:\n2 \"Now I know that you are able to do all things\nAnd that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you.\n3 You said, 'Who is this who is obscuring my counsel without knowledge?'\nTherefore I spoke, but without understanding\nAbout things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.\n4 You said, 'Please listen, and I will speak.\nI will question you, and you inform me.'\n5 My ears have heard about you,\nBut now I do see you with my eyes.\n6 That is why I take back what I said,\nAnd I repent in dust and ashes.\"\n7 After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite:\n\"My anger burns against you and your two companions, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has. 8 Now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt sacrifice for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you. I will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.\"\n9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what Jehovah had told them to do. And Jehovah accepted Job's prayer.\n10 After Job had prayed for his companions, Jehovah removed Job's tribulation and restored his prosperity. Jehovah gave him double what he had before. 11 All his brothers and sisters and all his former friends came to him and ate a meal with him in his house. They sympathized with him and comforted him over all the calamity that Jehovah had allowed to come upon him. Each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.\n12 So Jehovah blessed the last part of Job's life more than the beginning, and Job came to have 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 pairs of cattle, and 1,000 female donkeys. 13 He also came to have seven more sons and three more daughters. 14 He named the first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. 15 No women in all the land were as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.\n16 After this Job lived for 140 years, and he saw his children and his grandchildren-four generations. 17 Finally Job died, after a long and satisfying life.\n",

A melody of David.\n1 When I call, answer me, O my righteous God.\nMake a way of escape for me in my distress.\nShow me favor and hear my prayer.\n2 You sons of men, how long will you turn my honor into humiliation?\nHow long will you love what is worthless and search for what is false?

A melody of David.\n1 Listen to my words, O Jehovah;\nBe attentive to my sighing.\n2 Pay attention to my cry for help,\nO my King and my God, because to you I pray.\n3 O Jehovah, you will hear my voice in the morning;\nIn the morning I will express my concern to you and wait expectantly.\n4 For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness;\nNo one bad may remain with you.\n5 No arrogant person may stand in your presence.\nYou hate all those who behave wickedly;\n6 You will destroy those who speak lies.\nJehovah detests violent and deceptive people.\n7 But I will come into your house because of your great loyal love;\nI will bow down toward your holy temple in reverential fear of you.\n8 Lead me, O Jehovah, in your righteousness because of my foes;\nMake your way clear for me.\n9 For nothing they say can be trusted;\nWithin them is nothing but malice;\nTheir throat is an open grave;\nThey flatter with their tongue.\n10 But God will declare them guilty;\nTheir own schemes will cause their downfall.\nMay they be driven away because of their many transgressions,\nFor they have rebelled against you.\n11 But all those who take refuge in you will rejoice;\nThey will always shout joyfully.\nYou will block approach to them,\nAnd those loving your name will rejoice in you.\n12 For you will bless anyone righteous, O Jehovah;\nYou will surround them with approval as with a large shield.\nPsalm 6\nTo the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments tuned to Sheminith.

[Lamed]\n1 Why, O Jehovah, do you stand at a distance?\nWhy do you hide yourself in times of distress?\n2 The wicked one arrogantly pursues the helpless one,\nBut he will be caught in the schemes he devises.\n3 For the wicked one boasts about his selfish desires\nAnd blesses the greedy one;\n? [Nun]\nHe disrespects Jehovah.\n4 In his haughtiness, the wicked man makes no investigation;\nAll his thoughts are: \"There is no God.\"\n5 His ways keep prospering,\nBut your judgments are beyond his understanding;\nHe scoffs at all his adversaries.\n6 He says in his heart: \"I will never be shaken;\nFor generation after generation\nI will never see calamity.\"\n? [Pe]\n7 His mouth is full of curses, lies, and threats;\nUnder his tongue are trouble and injury.\n8 He waits in ambush near the settlements;\nFrom his hiding place he kills an innocent one.\n? [Ayin]\nHis eyes are watching for an unfortunate victim.\n9 He waits in his hiding place like a lion in its lair.\nHe waits to seize the helpless one.\nHe seizes the helpless one when he pulls his net shut.\n10 The victim is crushed and brought down;\nThe unfortunate ones fall into his clutches.\n11 He says in his heart: \"God has forgotten.\nHe has turned away his face.\nHe never notices.\"\n? [Qoph]\n12 Rise up, O Jehovah. O God, lift up your hand.\nDo not forget the helpless ones.\n13 Why has the wicked one disrespected God?\nHe says in his heart: \"You will not hold me accountable.\"\n?

[Shin]\n15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil man,\nSo that when you search for his wickedness,\nYou will find it no more.\n16 Jehovah is King forever and ever.\nThe nations have perished from the earth.\n? [Taw]\n17 But you will hear the request of the meek, O Jehovah.\nYou will make their hearts firm and pay close attention to them.\n18 You will render justice to the fatherless and to those who are crushed,\nSo that mortal man of the earth may no longer make them afraid.\nPsalm 11\nTo the director. Of David.\n1 In Jehovah I have taken refuge.\nSo how can you say to me:\n\"Flee like a bird to your mountain!\n2 See how the wicked bend the bow;\nThey set their arrow on the bowstring,\nTo shoot from the darkness those upright in heart.\n3 When the foundations are torn down,\nWhat can the righteous do?\"\n4 Jehovah is in his holy temple.\nJehovah's throne is in the heavens.\nHis own eyes see, his watchful eyes examine the sons of men.\n5 Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one;\nHe hates anyone who loves violence.\n6 Upon the wicked, he will rain down snares;\nFire and sulfur and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup.\n7 For Jehovah is righteous; he loves righteous acts.\nThe upright will see his face.\nPsalm 12\nTo the director; tuned to Sheminith. A melody of David.\n1 Save me, O Jehovah, for the loyal one is no more;\nFaithful people have vanished from among men.\n2 They speak lies to one another;\nThey flatter with their lips and speak with deceitful hearts.\n3 Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips\nAnd the tongue that makes great boasts,\n4 Those who say: \"We will prevail with our tongues.\nWe use our lips as we please;\nWho will be our master?\"\n5 \"Because the afflicted are oppressed,\nBecause of the sighing of the poor,\nI will rise up to act,\" says Jehovah.\n\"I will save them from those who treat them with contempt.\"\n6 The sayings of Jehovah are pure;\nThey are like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times.\n7 You will guard them, O Jehovah;\nYou will protect each one of them from this generation forever.\n8 The wicked walk around unrestrained\nBecause the sons of men promote depravity.\nPsalm 13\nTo the director. A melody of David.\n1 How long, O Jehovah, will you forget me? Forever?\nHow long will you hide your face from me?\n2 How long will I have anxious concern,\nWith grief in my heart each day?\nHow long will my enemy triumph over me?\n3 Look upon me and answer me, O Jehovah my God.\nGive light to my eyes, so that I may not fall asleep in death,\n4 So that my enemy will not say: \"I have defeated him!\"\nDo not let my opponents rejoice over my downfall.\n5 As for me, I trust in your loyal love;\nMy heart will rejoice in your acts of salvation.\n6 I will sing to Jehovah, for he has richly rewarded me.\nPsalm 14\nTo the director. Of David.\n1 The foolish one says in his heart:\n\"There is no Jehovah.\"\nTheir actions are corrupt, and their dealings are detestable;\nNo one is doing good.\n2 But Jehovah looks down from heaven on the sons of men\nTo see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah.\n3 They have all turned aside;\nThey are all alike corrupt.\nNo one is doing good,\nNot even one.\n4 Do none of the wrongdoers understand?\nThey devour my people as if they were eating bread.\nThey do not call on Jehovah.\n5 But they will be filled with great terror,\nFor Jehovah is with the generation of the righteous.\n6 You wrongdoers try to frustrate the plans of the lowly one,\nBut Jehovah is his refuge.\n7 O that Israel's salvation may come from Zion!\nWhen Jehovah gathers back his captive people,\nLet Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.\nPsalm 15\nA melody of David.\n1 O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent?\nWho may reside in your holy mountain?\n2 The one who is walking faultlessly,\nPracticing what is right\nAnd speaking the truth in his heart.\n3 He does not slander with his tongue,\nHe does nothing bad to his neighbor,\nAnd he does not defame his friends.\n4 He rejects anyone who is contemptible,\nBut he honors those fearing Jehovah.\nHe does not go back on his promise, even when it is bad for him.\n5 He does not lend his money on interest,\nAnd he does not accept a bribe against the innocent.\nWhoever does these things will never be shaken.\nPsalm 16\nA miktam of David.\n1 Protect me, O God, for I have taken refuge in you.\n2 I have said to Jehovah: \"You are Jehovah, my Source of goodness.\n3 And the holy ones in the earth,\nThe majestic ones, bring me great delight.\"\n4 Those who pursue other gods multiply their sorrows.\nI will never pour out their drink offerings of blood,\nNor will my lips mention their names.\n5 Jehovah is my portion, my allotted share, and my cup.\nYou safeguard my inheritance.\n6 Pleasant places have been measured out to me.\nYes, I am content with my inheritance.\n7 I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice.\nEven during the night, my innermost thoughts correct me.\n8 I keep Jehovah before me constantly.\nBecause he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken.\n9 So my heart rejoices, my whole being is joyful.\nAnd I reside in security.\n10 For you will not leave me in the Grave.\nYou will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.\n11 You make known to me the path of life.\nIn your presence is abundant joy;\nThere is happiness at your right hand forever.\nPsalm 17\nA prayer of David.\n1 Hear my plea for justice, O Jehovah;\nPay attention to my cry for help;\nListen to my prayer spoken without deceit.\n2 May you make a just decision in my behalf;\nMay your eyes see what is right.\n3 You have examined my heart, you have inspected me by night;\nYou have refined me;\nYou will find that I have not schemed anything bad,\nAnd my mouth has not transgressed.\n4 As for the activities of men,\nIn accord with the word of your lips, I avoid the paths of the robber.\n5 Let my steps stay on your tracks\nSo that my feet will not stumble.\n6 I do call on you, because you will answer me, O God.\nIncline your ear to me. Hear my words.\n7 Show your loyal love in a wonderful way,\nO Savior of those seeking refuge at your right hand\nFrom those who rebel against you.\n8 Guard me like the pupil of your eye;\nConceal me in the shadow of your wings.\n9 Guard me from the wicked who attack me,\nFrom my mortal enemies who surround me.\n10 They have become insensitive;\nWith their mouth they speak arrogantly;\n11 Now they hem us in;\nThey watch for the chance to cause our downfall.\n12 He is like a lion eager to tear its prey to pieces,\nLike a young lion crouching in ambush.\n13 Rise up, O Jehovah, to confront him and bring him down;\nRescue me from the wicked with your sword;\n14 Rescue me with your hand, O Jehovah,\nFrom men of this world, whose share is in this life,\nThose whom you fill with the good things you provide\nAnd who leave an inheritance to their many sons.\n15 But as for me, in righteousness I will see your face;\nI am satisfied to awaken in your presence.\nPsalm 18\nTo the director. By Jehovah's servant David, who addressed the words of this song to Jehovah in the day that Jehovah rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:\n1 I have affection for you, O Jehovah, my strength.\n2 Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the One who rescues me.\nMy God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,\nMy shield and my horn of salvation, my secure refuge.\n3 I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,\nAnd I will be saved from my enemies.\n4 The ropes of death encircled me;\nFlash floods of worthless men terrified me.\n5 The ropes of the Grave surrounded me;\nThe snares of death confronted me.\n6 In my distress I called on Jehovah,\nTo my God I kept crying for help.\nFrom his temple he heard my voice,\nAnd my cry to him for help reached his ears.\n7 Then the earth began to shake and rock;\nThe foundations of the mountains trembled\nAnd shook back and forth because he had been angered.\n8 Smoke ascended from his nostrils,\nAnd a consuming fire came from his mouth;\nGlowing coals blazed from him.\n9 He made the heavens bend as he descended,\nAnd thick gloom was beneath his feet.\n10 He rode on a cherub and came flying.\nHe swooped down on the wings of a spirit.\n11 He then covered himself in darkness,\nAll around him as a shelter,\nDark waters and thick clouds.\n12 From the brightness before him\nHail and fiery coals broke through the clouds.\n13 Then Jehovah began to thunder in the heavens;\nThe Most High made his voice heard\nWith hailstones and fiery coals.\n14 He shot his arrows and scattered them;\nHe hurled his lightning and threw them into confusion.\n15 The streambeds became visible;\nThe foundations of the land were exposed by your rebuke, O Jehovah,\nBy the blast of the breath from your nostrils.\n16 He reached down from on high;\nHe took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.\n17 He rescued me from my strong enemy,\nFrom those hating me, who were stronger than I was.\n18 They confronted me on the day of my disaster,\nBut Jehovah was my support.\n19 He brought me out into a place of safety;\nHe rescued me because he was pleased with me.\n20 Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness;\nHe repays me according to the innocence of my hands.\n21 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,\nAnd I have not wickedly abandoned my God.\n22 All his judgments are before me;\nI will not disregard his statutes.\n23 I will remain blameless before him,\nAnd I will keep myself from error.\n24 May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness,\nAccording to the innocence of my hands before him.\n25 With someone loyal you act in loyalty;\nWith the blameless man you deal blamelessly;\n26 With the pure you show yourself pure,\nBut with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.\n27 For you save those who are lowly\nBut you abase the haughty.\n28 For it is you who light my lamp, O Jehovah,\nMy God who lights up my darkness.\n29 With your help I can charge against a marauder band;\nBy God's power I can scale a wall.\n30 The way of the true God is perfect;\nThe saying of Jehovah is refined.\nHe is a shield to all those taking refuge in him.\n31 For who is a God besides Jehovah?\nAnd who is a rock except our God?\n32 The true God is the one who clothes me with strength,\nAnd he will make my way perfect.\n33 He makes my feet like those of a deer;\nHe makes me stand on high places.\n34 He trains my hands for warfare;\nMy arms can bend a bow of copper.\n35 You give me your shield of salvation,\nYour right hand supports me,\nAnd your humility makes me great.\n36 You widen the path for my footsteps;\nMy feet will not slip.\n37 I will pursue my enemies and overtake them;\nI will not return until they are wiped out.\n38 I will crush them so that they cannot rise up;\nThey will fall under my feet.\n39 You will equip me with strength for the battle;\nYou will make my foes collapse under me.\n40 You will make my enemies retreat from me,\nAnd I will put an end to those who hate me.\n41 They cry for help, but there is no one to save them;\nThey even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them.\n42 I will pound them as fine as dust in the wind;\nI will throw them out like mud in the streets.\n43 You will rescue me from the faultfinding of the people.\nYou will appoint me the head of nations.\nA people whom I have not known will serve me.\n44 At a mere report they will obey me;\nForeigners will come cringing before me.\n45 Foreigners will lose courage;\nThey will come trembling from their strongholds.\n46 Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock!\nLet the God of my salvation be exalted.\n47 The true God executes vengeance for me;\nHe subdues the peoples under me.\n48 He rescues me from my angry enemies;\nYou lift me high above those who attack me;\nYou save me from the man of violence.\n49 That is why I will glorify you among the nations, O Jehovah,\nAnd to your name I will sing praises.\n50 He performs great acts of salvation for his king;\nHe displays loyal love to his anointed one,\nTo David and his offspring forever.\nPsalm 19\nTo the director. A melody of David.\n1 The heavens are declaring the glory of God;\nThe skies above proclaim the work of his hands.\n2 Day after day their speech bubbles forth,\nAnd night after night they reveal knowledge.\n3 There is no speech, and there are no words;\nTheir voice is not heard.\n4 But into all the earth their sound has gone out,\nAnd to the ends of the inhabited earth their message.\nIn the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun;\n5 It is like a bridegroom emerging from the bridal chamber;\nIt rejoices like a mighty man running his course.\n6 It emerges from one end of the heavens,\nAnd it circles to their other end;\nAnd nothing is concealed from its heat.\n7 The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength.\nThe reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.\n8 The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice;\nThe commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.\n9 The fear of Jehovah is pure, lasting forever.\nThe judgments of Jehovah are true, altogether righteous.\n10 They are more desirable than gold,\nThan much fine gold,\nAnd sweeter than honey, the honey that drips from the combs.\n11 By them your servant has been warned;\nIn keeping them, there is a large reward.\n12 Who can discern mistakes?\nPronounce me innocent from sins I am unaware of.\n13 And hold your servant back from presumptuous acts;\nDo not let them dominate me.\nThen I will be complete,\nAnd innocent of blatant sins.\n14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart\nBe pleasing to you, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.\nPsalm 20\nTo the director. A melody of David.\n1 May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress.\nMay the name of the God of Jacob protect you.\n2 May he send you help from the holy place\nAnd sustain you from Zion.\n3 May he remember all your gift offerings;\nMay he accept with favor your burnt offering. (Selah)\n4 May he grant you the desires of your heart\nAnd give success to all your plans.\n5 We will shout joyfully over your acts of salvation;\nWe will lift our banners in the name of our God.\nMay Jehovah fulfill all your requests.\n6 Now I do know that Jehovah saves his anointed one.\nHe answers him from his holy heavens\nWith great salvation by his right hand.\n7 Some rely on chariots and others on horses,\nBut we call on the name of Jehovah our God.\n8 They have collapsed and fallen,\nBut we have risen up and been restored.\n9 O Jehovah, save the king!\nHe will answer us in the day we call for help.\nPsalm 21\nTo the director. A melody of David.\n1 O Jehovah, in your strength the king rejoices;\nHow greatly he rejoices in your acts of salvation!\n2 You have granted him the desire of his heart,\nAnd you have not withheld the request of his lips. (Selah)\n3 For you meet him with rich blessings;\nYou place a crown of fine gold on his head.\n4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him,\nA long life, forever and ever.\n5 Your acts of salvation bring him great glory.\nDignity and splendor you bestow on him.\n6 You make him blessed forever;\nYou make him glad with the joy of your presence.\n7 For the king trusts in Jehovah;\nBecause of the loyal love of the Most High, he will never be shaken.\n8 Your hand will find all your enemies;\nYour right hand will find those hating you.\n9 You will make them like a fiery furnace at the appointed time when you give them attention.\nJehovah will swallow them up in his anger, and fire will consume them.\n10 Their descendants you will destroy from the earth,\nAnd their offspring from the sons of men.\n11 For they intended to do what is bad against you;\nThey have devised schemes that will not succeed.\n12 For you will make them retreat\nBy aiming your bow at them.\n13 Rise up, O Jehovah, in your strength.\nWe will sing praises to your mightiness.\nPsalm 22\nTo the director; set to \"The Doe of the Dawn.\" A melody of David.\n1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\nWhy are you far from saving me,\nFar from my cries of anguish?\n2 My God, I keep calling by day, and you do not answer;\nAnd by night there is no silence on my part.\n3 But you are holy,\nSurrounded by the praises of Israel.\n4 In you our fathers put their trust;\nThey trusted, and you kept rescuing them.\n5 To you they cried out, and they were saved;\nThey trusted in you, and they were not disappointed.\n6 But I am a worm and not a man,\nScorned by men and despised by the people.\n7 All those seeing me mock me;\nThey sneer and shake their heads in derision:\n8 \"He entrusted himself to Jehovah. Let Him rescue him!\nLet Him save him, for he is so dear to Him!\"\n9 You were the One who brought me out of the womb,\nThe One who made me feel secure on my mother's breasts.\n10 I have been entrusted to your care from birth;\nFrom my mother's womb, you have been my God.\n11 Do not stay far off from me, for trouble is near\nAnd I have no other helper.\n12 Many young bulls surround me;\nPowerful bulls of Bashan encircle me.\n13 They open their mouth wide against me,\nLike a roaring lion that tears its prey to pieces.\n14 I am poured out like water;\nAll my bones are out of joint.\nMy heart has become like wax;\nIt melts deep within me.\n15 My strength has dried up like a piece of pottery;\nMy tongue sticks to my gums;\nYou are bringing me down to the dust of death.\n16 For dogs surround me;\nThey close in on me like a pack of evildoers,\nLike a lion they are at my hands and feet.\n17 I can count all my bones.\nThey look on and stare at me.\n18 They divide my garments among themselves,\nAnd they cast lots for my clothing.\n19 But you, O Jehovah, do not remain far away.\nYou are my strength; hurry to help me.\n20 Save me from the sword,\nMy precious life from the paws of dogs;\n21 Save me from the mouth of the lion and the horns of wild bulls;\nAnswer and save me.\n22 I will declare your name to my brothers;\nIn the midst of the congregation I will praise you.\n23 You who fear Jehovah, praise him!\nAll you offspring of Jacob, glorify him!\nStand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel.\n24 For he has not despised nor loathed the suffering of the oppressed one;\nHe has not hidden his face from him.\nWhen he cried to him for help, he heard.\n25 I will praise you in the large congregation;\nI will pay my vows before those who fear him.\n26 The meek will eat and be satisfied;\nThose seeking Jehovah will praise him.\nMay you enjoy life forever.\n27 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to Jehovah.\nAll the families of the nations will bow down before you.\n28 For the kingship belongs to Jehovah;\nHe rules over the nations.\n29 All the prosperous ones of the earth will eat and will bow down;\nAll those going down to the dust will kneel before him;\nNone of them can preserve their lives.\n30 Their descendants will serve him;\nThe generation to come will be told about Jehovah.\n31 They will come and tell of his righteousness.\nThey will tell the people yet to be born what he has done.\nPsalm 23\nA melody of David.\n1 Jehovah is my Shepherd.\nI will lack nothing.\n2 In grassy pastures he makes me lie down;\nHe leads me to well-watered resting-places.\n3 He refreshes me.\nHe leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name.\n4 Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,\nI fear no harm,\nFor you are with me;\nYour rod and your staff reassure me.\n5 You prepare a table for me before my enemies.\nYou refresh my head with oil;\nMy cup is well-filled.\n6 Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life,\nAnd I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all my days.\nPsalm 24\nOf David. A melody.\n1 To Jehovah belong the earth and everything in it,\nThe productive land and those dwelling on it.\n2 For he has solidly fixed it on the seas\nAnd firmly established it on the rivers.\n3 Who may ascend to the mountain of Jehovah,\nAnd who may stand up in his holy place?\n4 Anyone with innocent hands and a pure heart,\nWho has not sworn a false oath by My life,\nNor taken an oath deceitfully.\n5 He will receive blessings from Jehovah\nAnd righteousness from his God of salvation.\n6 This is the generation of those seeking him,\nOf those seeking your face, O God of Jacob. (Selah)\n7 Lift up your heads, you gates;\nOpen up, you ancient doorways,\nThat the glorious King may enter!\n8 Who is this glorious King?\nJehovah, strong and mighty,\nJehovah, mighty in battle.\n9 Lift up your heads, you gates;\nOpen up, you ancient doorways,\nThat the glorious King may enter!\n10 Who is he, this glorious King?\nJehovah of armies-he is the glorious King.

adversaries and my enemies were the ones who stumbled and fell.\n3 Though an army should set up camp against me,\nMy heart will not fear.\nThough war should break out against me,\nEven then I will remain confident.\n4 One thing I have asked from Jehovah\n-It is what I will look for-\nThat I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life,\nTo gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah\nAnd to look with appreciation upon his temple.\n5 For he will hide me in his shelter on the day of calamity;\nHe will conceal me in the secret place of his tent;\nHigh on a rock he will place me.\n6 Now my head is high above my enemies who surround me;\nI will offer sacrifices at his tent with joyful shouting;\nI will sing praises to Jehovah.\n7 Hear me, O Jehovah, when I cry out;\nShow me favor and answer me.\n8 Speaking for you, my heart has said:\n\"Seek to find my face.\"\nYour face, O Jehovah, I will seek to find.\n9 Do not hide your face from me.\nDo not turn your servant away in your anger.\nYou are my helper;\nDo not forsake me or leave me, my God of salvation.\n10 Even if my own father and mother abandon me,\nJehovah himself will take me in.\n11 Instruct me in your way, O Jehovah,\nLead me in the path of uprightness because of my foes.\n12 Do not hand me over to my adversaries,\nFor false witnesses have risen up against me,\nAnd they threaten me with violence.\n13 Where would I be if I did not have faith\nThat I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land of the living?\n14 Hope in Jehovah;\nBe courageous and strong of heart.\nYes, hope in Jehovah.\nPsalm 28\nOf David.\n1 To you I keep calling, O Jehovah my Rock;\nDo not turn a deaf ear to me.\nIf you keep silent toward me,\nI will become like those going down to the pit.\n2 Hear my pleas when I cry to you for help\nAs I lift up my hands toward the innermost room of your sanctuary.\n3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those practicing what is hurtful,\nThose who are speaking words of peace with their fellow man while evil is in their hearts.\n4 Pay them back for their deeds,\nAccording to their evil practices.\nRepay them for the work of their hands,\nAccording to what they have done.\n5 For they pay no attention to the activities of Jehovah,\nNor to the work of his hands.\nHe will tear them down and not build them up.\n6 May Jehovah be praised,\nFor he has heard my pleas for help.\n7 Jehovah is my strength and my shield;\nIn him my heart trusts.\nI have received his help, and my heart rejoices,\nSo I will praise him with my song.\n8 Jehovah is a strength for his people;\nHe is a

temple say: \"Glory!\"\n10 Jehovah sits enthroned above the flooding waters;\nJehovah sits enthroned as King forever.\n11 Jehovah will give strength to his people.\nJehovah will bless his people with peace.\nPsalm 30\nA melody. A song of inauguration of the house. Of David.\n1 I will exalt you, O Jehovah, for you have lifted me up;\nYou did not let my enemies rejoice over me.\n2 O Jehovah my God, I cried to you for help, and you healed me.\n3 O Jehovah, you have lifted me up from the Grave.\nYou kept me alive; you spared me from sinking into the pit.\n4 Sing praises to Jehovah, you his loyal ones,\nGive thanks to his holy name;\n5 Because being under his anger is only for a moment,\nBut being in his favor is for a lifetime.\nWeeping may come in the evening, but in the morning, there is a joyful cry.\n6 When I was untroubled, I said:\n\"I will never be shaken.\"\n7 O Jehovah, while I was in your favor, you made me as strong as a mountain.\nBut when you hid your face, I became terrified.\n8 To you, O Jehovah, I kept calling;\nAnd to Jehovah, I kept pleading for favor.\n9 What profit is there in my death, in my going down to the pit?\nWill the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?\n10 Hear, O Jehovah, and show me favor.\nO Jehovah, become my helper.\n11 You have changed my mourning into dancing;\nYou have removed my sackcloth, and you clothe me with rejoicing,\n12 So that I may sing your praise and not keep silent.\nO Jehovah my God, I will praise you forever.\nPsalm 31\nTo the director. A melody of David.\n1 In you, O Jehovah, I have taken refuge.\nMay I never be put to shame.\nRescue me because of your righteousness.\n2 Incline your ear to me.\nCome quickly to my rescue.\nBecome for me a mountain stronghold,\nA fortified place to save me.\n3 For you are my crag and my stronghold;\nFor the sake of your name, you will lead me and guide me.\n4 You will free me from the net that they have secretly laid for me,\nFor you are my fortress.\n5 Into your hand I entrust my spirit.\nYou have redeemed me, O Jehovah, the God of truth.\n6 I hate those who are devoted to worthless, vain idols,\nBut as for me, I trust in Jehovah.\n7 I will rejoice greatly in your loyal love,\nFor you have seen my affliction;\nYou are aware of my deep distress.\n8 You have not handed me over to the enemy,\nBut you make me stand in a place of safety.\n9 Show me favor, O Jehovah, for I am in distress.\nAnguish has made my eyes weak, my whole body as well.\n10 My life is consumed with grief\nAnd my years with groaning.\nMy strength is waning because of my error;\nMy bones grow weak.\n11 I am scorned by all my adversaries,\nEspecially my neighbors.\nAnd I am dreaded by my acquaintances;\nWhen they see me in public, they flee from me.\n12 I am put out of their heart and forgotten, as if I were dead;\nI am like a broken jar.\n13 I have heard many evil rumors;\nTerror surrounds me.\nWhen they gather together as one against me,\nThey scheme to take away my life.\n14 But I trust in you, O Jehovah.\nI declare: \"You are my God.\"\n15 My days are in your hand.\nRescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me.\n16 Make your face shine upon your servant.\nSave me by your loyal love.\n17 O Jehovah, may I not be put to shame when I call on you.\nMay the wicked be put to shame;\nMay they be silenced in the Grave.\n18 May lying lips become speechless,\nLips that speak arrogantly against the righteous, with haughtiness and contempt.\n19 How abundant your goodness is!\nYou have stored it up for those who fear you,\nAnd you have shown it before all men, in behalf of those taking refuge in you.\n20 You will conceal them in the secret place of your presence\nFrom the schemes of men;\nYou will hide them in your shelter\nFrom malicious attacks.\n21 May Jehovah be praised,\nFor in a wonderful way, he has shown his loyal love to me in a besieged city.\n22 As for me, I panicked and said:\n\"I will perish from before you.\"\nBut you heard my pleas for help when I cried out to you.\n23 Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!\nJehovah protects the faithful,\nBut he repays exceedingly anyone showing haughtiness.\n24 Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,\nAll you who are waiting for Jehovah.\nPsalm 32\nOf David. Maskil.\n1 Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.\n2 Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt,\nIn whose spirit there is no deceit.\n3 When I kept silent, my bones wasted away because of my groaning all day long.\n4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.\nMy strength evaporated like water in the dry summer heat. (Selah)\n5 Finally I confessed my sin to you;\nI did not cover my error.\nI said: \"I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah.\"\nAnd you pardoned the error of my sins. (Selah)\n6 This is why every loyal one will pray to you\nWhile you may yet be found.\nThen even the floodwaters will not reach him.\n7 You are a hiding place for me;\nYou will safeguard me from distress.\nYou will surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance.

A melody.\n1 Hear this, all you peoples.\nPay attention, all you inhabitants of the world,\n2 Both small and great,\nRich and poor alike.\n3 My own mouth will speak wisdom,\nAnd the meditation of my heart will show understanding.\n4 I will pay attention to a proverb;\nI will expound my riddle with the harp.\n5 Why should I fear during times of trouble,\nWhen I am surrounded by the evil of those trying to overthrow me?\n6 Those who are trusting in their wealth\nAnd who boast about their great riches,\n7 None of them can ever redeem a brother\nOr give to God a ransom for him,\n8 (The ransom price for their life is so precious\nThat it is always beyond their reach);\n9 That he should live forever and not see the pit.\n10 He sees that even wise people die;\nThe stupid and the unreasoning perish together,\nAnd they must leave their wealth to others.\n11 Their inner wish is that their houses will last forever,\nTheir tents to generation after generation.\nThey have named their estates after themselves.\n12 But man, although honored, will not remain;\nHe is no better than the beasts that perish.\n13 This is the way of the stupid ones\nAnd of those who follow them, who take pleasure in their empty words. (Selah)\n14 They are assigned like sheep to the Grave.\nDeath will shepherd them;\nThe upright will rule over them in the morning.\nEvery trace of them will fade away;\nThe Grave rather than a palace will be their home.\n15 But God will redeem me from the power of the Grave,\nFor he will take hold of me. (Selah)\n16 Do not be afraid because a man becomes rich,\nBecause the splendor of his house increases,\n17 For when he dies he can take nothing with him;\nHis splendor will not go down with him.\n18 For during his lifetime he congratulates himself.\n(People praise you when you prosper.)\n19 But he finally joins the generation of his forefathers.\nThey will never again see the light.\n20 A man who does not understand this, although honored,\nIs no better than the beasts that perish.\nPsalm 50\nA melody of Asaph.\n1 The God of gods, Jehovah, has spoken;\nHe summons the earth\nFrom the rising of the sun until its setting.\n2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.\n3 Our God will come and cannot remain silent.\nBefore him is a consuming fire,\nAnd a great storm rages all around him.\n4 He summons the heavens above and the earth,\nSo as to judge his people:\n5 \"Gather to me my loyal ones,\nThose making a covenant with me over sacrifice.\"\n6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness,\nFor God himself is Judge. (Selah)\n7 \"Listen, O my people, and I will speak;\nIsrael, I will bear witness against you.\nI am God, your God.\n8 I do not reprove you because of your sacrifices,\nNor because of your whole burnt offerings that are constantly before me.\n9 I do not need to take a bull from your house,\nNor goats from your pens.\n10 For every wild animal of the forest is mine,\nEven the beasts upon a thousand mountains.\n11 I know every bird of the mountains;\nThe countless animals of the field are mine.\n12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you,\nFor the productive land and everything in it is mine.\n13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls\nAnd drink the blood of goats?\n14 Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God,\nAnd pay your vows to the Most High;\n15 Call on me in the time of distress.\nI will rescue you, and you will glorify me.\"\n16 But God will say to the wicked:\n\"What right do you have to relate my regulations\nOr to speak about my covenant?\n17 For you hate discipline,\nAnd you keep turning your back on my words.\n18 When you see a thief, you approve of him,\nAnd you keep company with adulterers.\n19 You use your mouth to spread what is bad,\nAnd deception is attached to your tongue.\n20 You sit and speak against your own brother;\nYou reveal the faults of your own mother's son.\n21 When you did these things, I remained silent,\nSo you thought that I would be just like you.\nBut now I will reprove you,\nAnd I will state my case against you.\n22 Please consider this, you who forget God,\nSo that I may not tear you to pieces with no one to rescue you.\n23 The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me,\nAnd as for the one who follows a set course,\nI will cause him to see salvation by God.\"\nPsalm 51\nTo the director. A melody of David, when Nathan the prophet came in to him after David had relations with Bath-sheba.\n1 Show me favor, O God, according to your loyal love.\nBlot out my transgressions according to your great mercy.\n2 Thoroughly wash me from my error,\nAnd cleanse me from my sin.\n3 For I am well-aware of my transgressions,\nAnd my sin is always before me.\n4 Against you-you above all-I have sinned;\nWhat is bad in your eyes I have done.\nTherefore, you are righteous when you speak,\nYou are right in your judgment.\n5 Look! I was born guilty of error,\nAnd my mother conceived me in sin.\n6 Look! You find pleasure in truth in the inner person;\nTeach my innermost self true wisdom.\n7 Purify me from my sin with hyssop, so that I will be clean;\nWash me, so that I will be whiter than snow.\n8 Let me hear sounds of joy and rejoicing,\nSo that the bones you crushed will rejoice.\n9 Turn your face away from my sins,\nAnd wipe away all my errors.\n10 Create in me a pure heart, O God,\nAnd put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.\n11 Do not cast me out from your presence;\nAnd do not take your holy spirit away from me.\n12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation;\nStir within me a willingness to obey you.\n13 I will teach transgressors your ways,\nSo that sinners will return to you.\n14 Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation,\nSo that my tongue may joyfully declare your righteousness.\n15 O Jehovah, open my lips,\nSo that my mouth may declare your praise.\n16 For you do not want a sacrifice-otherwise I would give it;\nYou do not find delight in a whole burnt offering.\n17 The sacrifices pleasing to God are a broken spirit;\nA heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.\n18 In your goodwill do what is good for Zion;\nBuild up the walls of Jerusalem.\n19 Then you will take delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,\nThe burnt sacrifices and the whole offerings;\nThen bulls will be offered up on your altar.\nPsalm 52\nTo the director. Maskil. Of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul that David had come to the house of Ahimelech.\n1 Why do you boast about your evil acts, you mighty one?\nThe loyal love of God lasts all day long.\n2 Your tongue, as sharp as a razor,\nSchemes harm and works deceitfully.\n3 You love evil more than what is good,\nLying more than speaking what is right. (Selah)\n4 You love every harmful word,\nO you deceitful tongue!\n5 That is why God will pull you down once and for all;\nHe will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent;\nHe will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)\n6 The righteous ones will see it and be filled with awe,\nAnd they will laugh at him.\n7 \"Here is a man who did not make God his refuge,\nBut he trusted in his great riches\nAnd relied on his own evil plots.\"\n8 But I will be like a luxuriant olive tree in God's house;\nMy trust is in God's loyal love, forever and ever.\n9 I will praise you forever because you have taken action;\nIn the presence of your loyal ones,\nI will hope in your name, for it is good.\nPsalm 53\nTo the director; in the style of Mahalath. Maskil. Of David.\n1 The foolish one says in his heart:\n\"There is no Jehovah.\"\nTheir unrighteous actions are corrupt and detestable;\nNo one is doing good.\n2 But God looks down from heaven on the sons of men\nTo see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah.\n3 They have all turned away;\nThey are all alike corrupt.\nNo one is doing good,\nNot even one.\n4 Do none of the wrongdoers understand?\nThey devour my people as if they were eating bread.\nThey do not call on Jehovah.\n5 But they will be filled with great terror,\nTerror they have never felt before,\nFor God will scatter the bones of those attacking you.\nYou will put them to shame, for Jehovah has rejected them.\n6 O that Israel's salvation may come from Zion!\nWhen Jehovah gathers back his captive people,\nLet Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.\nPsalm 54\nTo the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. Maskil. Of David, when the Ziphites came in and said to Saul: \"David is hiding among us.\"\n1 O God, save me by your name,\nAnd defend me with your power.\n2 O God, hear my prayer;\nPay attention to the words of my mouth.\n3 For strangers rise up against me,\nAnd ruthless men seek my life.\nThey have no regard for God. (Selah)\n4 Look! God is my helper;\nJehovah is with those supporting me.\n5 He will repay my foes with their own evil;\nIn your faithfulness, put an end to them.\n6 I will sacrifice to you willingly.\nI will praise your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.\n7 For he saves me from every distress,\nAnd I will look in triumph on my enemies.\nPsalm 55\nTo the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. Maskil. Of David.\n1 Listen to my prayer, O God,\nAnd do not ignore my request for mercy.\n2 Do pay attention to me and answer me.\nMy concern makes me restless,\nAnd I am distraught\n3 Because of what the enemy is saying\nAnd the pressure from the wicked one.\nFor they heap trouble upon me,\nAnd in anger they harbor animosity against me.\n4 My heart is in anguish within me,\nAnd the terrors of death overwhelm me.\n5 Fear and trembling come upon me,\nAnd shuddering grips me.\n6 I keep saying: \"If only I had wings like a dove!\nI would fly away and reside in safety.\n7 Look! I would flee far away.\nI would lodge in the wilderness. (Selah)\n8 I would hurry to a place of shelter\nAway from the raging wind, away from the storm.\"\n9 Confuse them, O Jehovah, and frustrate their plans,\nFor I have seen violence and conflict in the city.\n10 Day and night they walk around on its walls;\nWithin it are malice and trouble.\n11 Ruin is in its midst;\nOppression and deception never depart from its public square.\n12 For it is not an enemy who taunts me;\nOtherwise I could put up with it.\nIt is not a foe who has risen up against me;\nOtherwise I could conceal myself from him.\n13 But it is you, a man like me,\nMy own companion whom I know well.\n14 We used to enjoy a warm friendship together;\nInto the house of God we used to walk along with the multitude.\n15 May destruction overtake them!\nLet them go down alive into the Grave;\nFor evil resides among them and within them.\n16 As for me, I will call out to God,\nAnd Jehovah will save me.\n17 Evening and morning and noontime, I am troubled and I groan,\nAnd he hears my voice.\n18 He will rescue me and give me peace from those fighting against me,\nFor multitudes come against me.\n19 God will hear and respond to them,\nThe one who sits enthroned from of old. (Selah)\nThey will refuse to change,\nThose who have not feared God.\n20 He attacked those at peace with him;\nHe violated his covenant.\n21 His words are smoother than butter,\nBut conflict is in his heart.\nHis words are softer than oil,\nBut they are drawn swords.\n22 Throw your burden on Jehovah,\nAnd he will sustain you.\nNever will he allow the righteous one to fall.\n23 But you, O God, will bring them down to the deepest pit.\nThose bloodguilty and deceitful men will not live out half their days.\nBut as for me, I will trust in you.\nPsalm 56\nTo the director; set to \"The Silent Dove That Is Far Away.\" Of David. Miktam. When the Philistines captured him in Gath.\n1 Show me favor, O God, because mortal man is attacking me.\nAll day long they keep fighting and oppressing me.\n2 My foes keep snapping at me all day long;\nMany arrogantly fight against me.\n3 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.\n4 In God-whose word I praise-\nIn God I put my trust; I am not afraid.\nWhat can mere man do to me?\n5 All day long they hurt my interests;\nTheir only thought is to harm me.\n6 They conceal themselves to attack;\nThey watch my every step,\nHoping to take away my life.\n7 Reject them because of their wickedness.\nBring down the nations in your anger, O God.\n8 You keep track of my wandering.\nDo collect my tears in your skin bottle.\nAre they not recorded in your book?\n9 My enemies will retreat on the day that I call for help.\nOf this I am confident: God is on my side.\n10 In God-whose word I praise-\nIn Jehovah-whose word I praise-\n11 In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.\nWhat can a mere human do to me?\n12 I am bound by my vows to you, O God;\nI will offer you expressions of thanksgiving.\n13 For you have rescued me from death\nAnd prevented my feet from stumbling,\nSo that I may walk before God in the light of the living.\nPsalm 57\nTo the director; set to \"Do Not Bring to Ruin.\" Of David. Miktam. When he ran away from Saul into the cave.\n1 Show me favor, O God, show me favor,\nFor I take refuge in you,\nAnd in the shadow of your wings I take refuge until the troubles pass.\n2 I call to God the Most High,\nTo the true God, who brings them to an end for me.\n3 He will send help from heaven and save me.\nHe will frustrate the one snapping at me. (Selah)\nGod will send his loyal love and his faithfulness.\n4 I am surrounded by lions;\nI must lie among men who want to devour me,\nWhose teeth are spears and arrows\nAnd whose tongue is a sharp sword.\n5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God;\nMay your glory be over all the earth.\n6 They have prepared a net to ensnare my feet;\nI am bowed down with distress.\nThey have dug a pit ahead of me,\nBut they fell into it themselves. (Selah)\n7 My heart is steadfast, O God,\nMy heart is steadfast.\nI will sing and make music.\n8 Do awake, my glory.\nDo awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp.\nI will awaken the dawn.\n9 I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah;\nI will sing praises to you among the nations.\n10 For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens,\nAnd your faithfulness, up to the skies.\n11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God;\nMay your glory be over all the earth.\nPsalm 58\nTo the director; set to \"Do Not Bring to Ruin.\" Of David. Miktam.\n1 Can you speak about righteousness when you are silent?\nCan you judge in uprightness, you sons of men?\n2 Instead, you devise unrighteousness in your heart,\nAnd your hands dispense violence in the land.\n3 The wicked go astray from birth;\nThey are wayward, liars from the time they are born.\n4 Their venom is like the venom of serpents;\nThey are deaf like the cobra that stops up its ear.\n5 It will not listen to the voice of charmers,\nNo matter how skillful their spells.\n6 O God, knock the teeth out of their mouth!\nBreak the jaws of these lions, O Jehovah!\n7 May they disappear like waters that drain away.\nMay He bend his bow and make them fall by his arrows.\n8 May they be like a snail that melts away as it moves along;\nLike a woman's stillborn child who never sees the sun.\n9 Before your cooking pots feel the heat of the bramble,\nHe will sweep away both the moist and the burning twig, as in a storm wind.\n10 The righteous one will rejoice because he has seen the vengeance;\nHis feet will be drenched with the blood of the wicked.\n11 Then men will say: \"Surely there is a reward for the righteous.\nThere is indeed a God who judges in the earth.\"\nPsalm 59\nTo the director; set to \"Do Not Bring to Ruin.\" Of David. Miktam. When Saul sent men to watch David's house to put him to death.\n1 Rescue me from my enemies, O my God;\nProtect me from those rising up against me.\n2 Rescue me from those who act wickedly,\nAnd save me from violent men.\n3 Look! They wait to ambush me;\nStrong men attack me\nBut not because I have revolted or sinned, O Jehovah.\n4 Though I did no wrong, they run and prepare to attack.\nDo arise at my calling and see.\n5 For you, O Jehovah God of armies, are the God of Israel.\nAwake to turn your attention to all the nations.\nDo not show mercy to any malicious traitors. (Selah)\n6 They return each evening;\nThey growl like dogs and prowl around the city.\n7 Look what pours forth from their mouth;\nTheir lips are like swords,\nFor they say: \"Who is listening?\"\n8 But you, O Jehovah, will laugh at them;\nYou will scoff at all the nations.\n9 O my Strength, I will keep watch for you;\nFor God is my secure refuge.\n10 The God who shows loyal love to me will come to my aid;\nGod will cause me to look in triumph on my foes.\n11 Do not kill them, so that my people may not forget.\nBy your power make them wander about;\nCause their downfall, O Jehovah, our shield.\n12 For the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips,\nMay they be trapped by their pride,\nBecause of the cursing and deception that they speak.\n13 Finish them off in your wrath;\nFinish them off, so that they are no more;\nMake them know that God is ruling in Jacob and to the ends of the earth. (Selah)\n14 Let them return in the evening;\nLet them growl like dogs and prowl around the city.\n15 Let them wander about for something to eat;\nDo not let them be satisfied or find a lodging place.\n16 But as for me, I will sing about your strength;\nIn the morning I will joyfully tell about your loyal love.\nFor you are my secure refuge\nAnd a place for me to flee in my time of distress.\n17 O my Strength, to you I will sing praises,\nFor God is my secure refuge, the God who shows loyal love to me.\nPsalm 60\nTo the director; set to \"The Lily of Reminder.\" Miktam. Of David. For teaching. When he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-Zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.\n1 O God, you rejected us; you broke through our defenses.\nYou were angry with us; but now accept us back!\n2 You caused the earth to quake; you split it open.\nRepair its breaches, for it is falling.\n3 You caused your people to suffer hardship.\nYou made us drink wine that makes us stagger.\n4 Give a signal to those fearing you\nTo flee and dodge the bow. (Selah)\n5 So that your loved ones may be rescued,\nSave us with your right hand and answer us.\n6 God has spoken in his holiness:\n\"I will exult, I will give out Shechem as an inheritance,\nAnd I will measure off the Valley of Succoth.\n7 Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh,\nAnd Ephraim is the helmet for my head;\nJudah is my commander's staff.\n8 Moab is my washbasin.\nOver Edom I will throw my sandal.\nOver Philistia I will shout in triumph.\"\n9 Who will bring me to the besieged city?\nWho will lead me as far as Edom?\n10 Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us,\nOur God, who no longer goes out with our armies?\n11 Help us in our distress,\nFor salvation by humans is worthless.\n12 By God we will gain power,\nAnd he will trample on our adversaries.\nPsalm 61\nTo the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments.

A melody of David.\n1 Indeed, I wait silently for God.\nMy salvation comes from him.\n2 Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge;\nI will never be greatly shaken.\n3 How long will you assault a man in order to murder him?\nAll of you are as dangerous as a leaning wall, a stone wall ready to collapse.\n4 For they consult together to topple him from his high position;\nThey take pleasure in lying.\nWith their mouth they bless, but inside they are cursing. (Selah)\n5 Indeed, I wait silently for God\nBecause my hope comes from him.\n6 Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge;\nI will never be shaken.\n7 Upon God depends my salvation and my glory.\nMy strong rock, my refuge, is God.\n8 Trust in him at all times, O people.\nPour out your hearts before him.\nGod is a refuge for us. (Selah)\n9 The sons of men are a mere breath,\nThe sons of mankind are a delusion.\nWhen laid together on the scales, they are lighter than a mere breath.\n10 Do not trust in extortion\nOr put false hopes in robbery.\nIf your wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.\n11 Once God has spoken, twice I have heard this:\nThat strength belongs to God.\n12 Also loyal love is yours, O Jehovah,\nFor you repay each one according to his deeds.\nPsalm 63\nA melody of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.\n1 O God, you are my God, I keep looking for you.\nI do thirst for you.\nI am faint with longing for you\nIn a dry and parched land, where there is no water.\n2 So I have looked upon you in the holy place;\nI have seen your strength and your glory.\n3 Because your loyal love is better than life,\nMy own lips will glorify you.\n4 Thus I will praise you all my life;\nIn your name I will lift up my hands.\n5 I am satisfied with the best and choicest portion,\nSo my mouth will praise you with joy on my lips.\n6 I remember you while upon my bed;\nI meditate on you during the watches of the night.\n7 For you are my helper,\nAnd I shout joyfully in the shadow of your wings.\n8 I cling to you;\nYour right hand keeps fast hold on me.\n9 But those who seek to destroy my life\nWill descend into the depths of the earth.\n10 They will be handed over to the power of the sword;\nThey will become food for jackals.\n11 But the king will rejoice in God.\nEvery person swearing by Him will exult,\nFor the mouth of those speaking lies will be silenced.\nPsalm 64\nTo the director. A melody of David.\n1 Hear my voice, O God, as I plead.\nSafeguard my life from the dreadfulness of the enemy.\n2 Shield me from the secret plots of wicked men,\nFrom the crowd of wrongdoers.\n3 They sharpen their tongue just like a sword;\nThey aim their cruel words like arrows,\n4 To shoot at the innocent from their hiding places;\nThey shoot at him suddenly, without fear.\n5 They hold fast to their evil intent;\nThey discuss how to hide their traps.\nThey say: \"Who will see them?\"\n6 They search out new ways of wrongdoing;\nThey secretly devise their shrewd strategy;\nThe thinking within each one's heart is unfathomable.\n7 But God will shoot at them;\nSuddenly they will be wounded by an arrow.\n8 Their own tongue will cause their downfall;\nAll those looking on will shake their head.\n9 Then all men will become afraid,\nAnd they will proclaim what God has done,\nAnd they will have insight into his deeds.\n10 The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in him;\nAll the upright in heart will exult.\nPsalm 65\nTo the director.

Rejoice before him!\n5 A father of the fatherless and a protector of widows\nIs God in his holy dwelling.\n6 God gives those who are alone a home to dwell in;\nHe leads prisoners out into prosperity.\nBut the stubborn must live in a parched land.\n7 O God, when you led your people,\nWhen you marched through the desert, (Selah)\n8 The earth quaked;\nHeaven poured down rain because of God;\nThis Sinai quaked because of God, the God of Israel.\n9 You made it rain in abundance, O God;\nYou reinvigorated your exhausted people.\n10 They dwelled in your tent community;\nIn your goodness, you provided for the poor, O God.\n11 Jehovah gives the command;\nThe women proclaiming the good news are a large army.\n12 The kings of armies flee, they flee!\nShe who remains at home shares in the spoil.\n13 Although you men were lying among the campfires,\nThere will be the wings of a dove covered with silver,\nWith pinions of fine gold.\n14 When the Almighty One scattered its kings,\nSnow fell in Zalmon.\n15 The mountain of Bashan is a mountain of God;\nThe mountain of Bashan is a mountain of peaks.\n16 Why do you look with envy, you mountains of peaks,\nToward the mountain that God has chosen as his dwelling?\nIndeed, Jehovah will reside there forever.\n17 The war chariots of God are tens of thousands, thousands upon thousands.\nJehovah has come from Sinai into the holy place.\n18 You ascended on high;\nYou carried away captives;\nYou took gifts in the form of men,\nYes, even stubborn ones, to reside among them, O Jah God.\n19 May Jehovah be praised, who daily carries our load,\nThe true God of our salvation. (Selah)\n20 The true God is for us a God who saves;\nAnd Jehovah the Sovereign Lord provides escape from death.\n21 Yes, God will smash the heads of his enemies,\nThe hairy crown of the head of anyone who continues in his guilt.\n22 Jehovah has said: \"I will bring them back from Bashan;\nI will bring them back from the depths of the sea,\n23 So that your foot may be awash in blood\nAnd the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from the enemies.\"\n24 They see your processions, O God,\nThe processions of my God, my King, into the holy place.\n25 The singers walk in front, the musicians playing stringed instruments after them;\nIn between are the young women playing tambourines.\n26 In congregated throngs, praise God;\nPraise Jehovah, you who are from the Source of Israel.\n27 There Benjamin, the youngest, is subduing them,\nAlso the princes of Judah with their noisy crowd,\nThe princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.\n28 Your God has decreed that you will be strong.\nShow your strength, O God, you who have acted in our behalf.\n29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem,\nKings will bring gifts to you.\n30 Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds,\nThe assembly of bulls and their calves,\nUntil the peoples bow down bringing pieces of silver.\nBut he scatters the peoples who delight in war.\n31 Bronze articles will be brought out of Egypt;\nCush will hasten to offer gifts to God.\n32 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God,\nSing praises to Jehovah, (Selah)\n33 To the one who rides the ancient heaven of heavens.\nLook! He thunders with his voice, his mighty voice.\n34 Acknowledge God's strength.\nHis majesty is over Israel,\nAnd his strength is in the skies.\n35 God is awe-inspiring from his grand sanctuary.\nHe is the God of Israel,\nWho gives strength and power to the people.\nPraise to God.\nPsalm 69\nTo the director; set to \"The Lilies.\" Of David.\n1 Save me, O God, for the waters threaten my life.\n2 I have sunk down into the deep mud, where there is no solid ground.\nI have come into deep waters,\nAnd the rushing stream has swept me away.\n3 I am exhausted from calling out;\nMy throat has become hoarse.\nMy eyes have grown weary while waiting for my God.\n4 Those hating me without cause\nAre more numerous than the hairs of my head.\nThose who would do away with me,\nMy treacherous enemies, have become many.\nI was forced to hand over what I had not stolen.\n5 O God, you are aware of my foolishness,\nAnd my guilt is not hidden from you.\n6 May those hoping in you not be put to shame because of me,\nO Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies.\nMay those seeking you not be humiliated because of me,\nO God of Israel.\n7 I suffer reproach on your account;\nHumiliation covers my face.\n8 I have become a stranger to my brothers,\nA foreigner to the sons of my mother.\n9 Zeal for your house has consumed me,\nAnd the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me.\n10 When I humbled myself with fasting,\nI was reproached for it.\n11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,\nI became an object of scorn to them.\n12 I am the talk of those sitting in the city gate,\nAnd the drunkards make me the subject of their songs.\n13 But may my prayer come to you,\nO Jehovah, at an acceptable time.\nIn your abundant loyal love, O God,\nAnswer me with your sure acts of salvation.\n14 Rescue me from the mire;\nDo not let me sink down.\nRescue me from those who hate me\nAnd from the deep waters.\n15 Do not let the rushing floodwaters sweep me away,\nOr let the deep swallow me,\nOr let the well close its mouth over me.\n16 Answer me, O Jehovah, for your loyal love is good.\nAccording to your abundant mercy turn toward me,\n17 And do not hide your face from your servant.\nAnswer me quickly, for I am in distress.\n18 Come near to me and rescue me;\nRedeem me on account of my enemies.\n19 You know my reproach and my disgrace and my humiliation.\nYou see all my foes.\n20 Reproach has broken my heart, and the wound is incurable.\nI was hoping for sympathy, but there was none,\nAnd for comforters, but I found none.\n21 But for food they gave me poison,\nAnd for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\n22 Let their table become a trap for them,\nAnd their prosperity, a snare.\n23 Let their eyes become darkened so that they cannot see,\nAnd make their hips tremble constantly.\n24 Pour out upon them your indignation,\nAnd may your burning anger overtake them.\n25 Let their encampment become desolate;\nLet there be no inhabitant in their tents.\n26 For they pursue the one whom you struck,\nAnd they keep recounting the pains of those you wounded.\n27 Add more guilt to their guilt,\nAnd may they have no share in your righteousness.\n28 Let them be erased from the book of the living,\nAnd may they not be enrolled among the righteous.\n29 But I am afflicted and in pain.\nMay your saving power, O God, protect me.\n30 I will sing praises to the name of God,\nAnd I will magnify him with thanksgiving.\n31 This will please Jehovah more than a bull,\nMore than a young bull with horns and hooves.\n32 The meek will see it and rejoice.\nYou who are seeking God, may your hearts revive.\n33 For Jehovah is listening to the poor,\nAnd he will not despise his captive people.\n34 Let heaven and earth praise him,\nThe seas and everything that moves in them.\n35 For God will save Zion\nAnd will rebuild the cities of Judah,\nAnd they will dwell there and possess it.\n36 The descendants of his servants will inherit it,\nAnd those who love his name will reside in it.\nPsalm 70\nTo the director.

righteousness save me and rescue me.\nIncline your ear to me and save me.\n3 Become for me a rock fortress\nWhere I can always enter.\nGive the command to save me,\nFor you are my crag and my stronghold.\n4 O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked,\nFrom the grasp of the unjust oppressor.\n5 For you are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah;\nI have trusted in you since my youth.\n6 I have depended on you from birth;\nIt was you who took me from my mother's womb.\nI praise you constantly.\n7 I have become like a miracle to many,\nBut you are my strong refuge.\n8 My mouth is filled with your praise;\nAll day long I tell about your splendor.\n9 Do not cast me off in my old age;\nDo not abandon me when my strength fails.\n10 My enemies speak against me,\nAnd those seeking to take my life conspire together,\n11 Saying: \"God has abandoned him.\nChase after him and seize him, for there is no one to save him.\"\n12 O God, do not remain far away from me.\nO my God, hurry to help

righteousness,\nAnd of your lowly ones with justice.\n3 May the mountains bring peace to the people,\nAnd may the hills bring righteousness.\n4 Let him defend the lowly among the people,\nLet him save the sons of the poor,\nAnd let him crush the defrauder.\n5 They will fear you as long as there is a sun\nAnd as long as the moon remains,\nFor generation after generation.\n6 He will be like the rain that falls on the mown grass,\nLike showers of rain that water the earth.\n7 In his days the righteous will flourish,\nAnd peace will abound until the moon is no more.\n8 He will have subjects from sea to sea\nAnd from the River to the ends of the earth.\n9 The desert dwellers will bow down before him,\nAnd his enemies will lick the dust.\n10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will pay tribute.\nThe kings of Sheba and of Seba will present gifts.\n11 All the kings will bow down before him,\nAnd all the nations will serve him.\n12 For he will rescue the poor who cry for help,\nAlso the lowly one and whoever has no helper.\n13 He will have pity on the lowly and the poor,\nAnd the lives of the poor he will save.\n14 From oppression and from violence he will rescue them,\nAnd their blood will be precious in his eyes.\n15 May he live and be given the gold of Sheba.\nMay prayers be said for him continually,\nAnd may he be blessed all day long.\n16 There will be an abundance of

Jesse.\nBook Three\n(Psalms 73-89)\nPsalm 73\nA melody of Asaph.\n1 God is truly good to Israel, to those pure in heart.\n2 As for me, my feet had almost strayed;\nMy steps had nearly slipped.\n3 For I became envious of the arrogant\nWhen I would see the peace of the wicked.\n4 For they have no pain in their death;\nTheir bodies are healthy.\n5 They are not troubled like other humans,\nNor do they suffer like other men.\n6 Therefore, haughtiness is their necklace;\nViolence clothes them as a garment.\n7 Their prosperity makes their eyes bulge;\nThey have exceeded the imaginations of the heart.\n8 They scoff and say evil things.\nThey arrogantly threaten oppression.\n9 They speak as if they were as high as heaven,\nAnd their tongues swagger about in the earth.\n10 So his people turn aside to them,\nAnd they drink from their abundant water.\n11 They say: \"How does God know?\nDoes the Most High really have knowledge?\"\n12 Yes, these are the wicked, who always have it easy.\nThey keep increasing their wealth.\n13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure\nAnd washed my hands in innocence.\n14 And I was troubled all day long;\nEvery morning I was chastised.\n15 But if I had said these things,\nI would have betrayed your people.\n16 When I tried to understand it,\nIt was troubling to me\n17 Until I entered the grand sanctuary of God,\nAnd I discerned their future.\n18 Surely you place them on slippery ground.\nYou make them fall to their ruin.\n19 How suddenly they are devastated!\nHow sudden is their finish as they come to a terrible end!\n20 Like a dream when one wakes up, O Jehovah,\nWhen you rouse yourself, you will dismiss their image.\n21 But my heart was sour,\nAnd deep inside I felt sharp pain.\n22 I was unreasoning and lacked understanding;\nI was like a senseless beast before you.\n23 But now I am continually with you;\nYou have taken hold of my right hand.\n24 You guide me with your advice,\nAnd afterward you will lead me to glory.\n25 Whom do I have in the heavens?\nAnd besides you I desire nothing on earth.\n26 My body and my heart may fail,\nBut God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.\n27 Truly, those keeping far from you will perish.\nYou will put an end to everyone who immorally leaves you.\n28 But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me.\nI have made the Sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge,\nTo declare all your works.\nPsalm 74\nA maskil. Of Asaph.\n1 Why, O God, have you rejected us forever?\nWhy does your anger burn against the flock of your pasture?\n2 Remember the people you acquired long ago,\nThe tribe you redeemed as your inheritance.\nRemember Mount Zion, where you have resided.\n3 Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins.\nThe enemy has devastated everything in the holy place.\n4 Your foes roared inside your meeting place.\nThey have set up their own banners as signs there.\n5 They were like men wielding axes against a thick forest.\n6 They broke up all its engravings with axes and iron bars.\n7 They set your sanctuary on fire.\nThey profaned the tabernacle bearing your name, casting it to the ground.\n8 They and their offspring have said in their hearts:\n\"All the meeting places of God in the land must be burned.\"\n9 There are no signs for us to see;\nThere is no longer any prophet,\nAnd no one among us knows how long this will last.\n10 How long, O God, will the adversary keep taunting?\nWill the enemy treat your name with disrespect forever?\n11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?\nDraw it out of your bosom and put an end to them.\n12 But God is my King from long ago,\nThe one performing acts of salvation on the earth.\n13 You stirred up the sea with your strength;\nYou smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.\n14 You crushed the heads of Leviathan;\nYou gave it as food to the people, to those inhabiting the deserts.\n15 You cut openings for the springs and the streams;\nYou dried up ever-flowing rivers.\n16 The day belongs to you, also the night.\nYou made the light and the sun.\n17 You set up all the boundaries of the earth;\nYou made summer and winter.\n18 Remember the enemy's taunts, O Jehovah,\nHow a foolish people treats your name with disrespect.\n19 Do not surrender the life of your turtledove to the wild beasts.\nDo not forget the life of your afflicted people forever.\n20 Remember the covenant,\nFor the dark places of the earth have become full of the haunts of violence.\n21 May the crushed one not turn away disappointed;\nMay the lowly and the poor praise your name.\n22 Rise up, O God, and plead your legal case.\nRemember how the foolish taunt you all day long.\n23 Do not forget what your foes are saying.\nThe uproar of those who defy you is ascending constantly.\nPsalm 75\nTo the director. Set to the melody \"Do Not Bring to Ruin.\" Of Asaph. A song.\n1 We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks to you;\nYour name is near,\nAnd people declare your wondrous works.\n2 You say: \"When I set a time,\nI judge with fairness.\n3 When the earth and all its inhabitants were dissolved,\nIt was I who kept its pillars firm.\" (Selah)\n4 I say to the boastful, \"Do not boast,\"\nAnd to the wicked, \"Do not exalt your strength.\n5 Do not exalt your strength up high\nOr speak with arrogance.\n6 For exaltation does not come\nFrom the east or the west or the south.\n7 For God is Judge.\nHe puts one man down and exalts another.\n8 For there is a cup in Jehovah's hand;\nThe wine is foaming and is fully mixed.\nHe will surely pour it out,\nAnd all the wicked of the earth will drink it, down to the dregs.\"\n9 But as for me, I will proclaim it forever;\nI will sing praises to the God of Jacob.\n10 For he says: \"I will cut off all the strength of the wicked,\nBut the strength of the righteous will be exalted.\"\nPsalm 76\nTo the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. A melody of Asaph. A song.\n1 God is known in Judah;\nIn Israel his name is great.\n2 His shelter is in Salem,\nAnd his dwelling is in Zion.\n3 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,\nThe shield and the sword and the weapons of war. (Selah)\n4 You shine brightly;\nYou are more majestic than the mountains of prey.\n5 The courageous of heart have been plundered.\nThey have fallen asleep;\nThe warriors were all helpless.\n6 From your rebuke, O God of Jacob,\nBoth the charioteer and the horse have fallen fast asleep.\n7 You alone are awe-inspiring.\nWho can withstand your intense anger?\n8 From heaven you pronounced judgment;\nThe earth was afraid and was silent\n9 When God rose up to execute judgment,\nTo save all the meek of the earth. (Selah)\n10 For the rage of man will serve to your praise;\nWith the remnants of their rage you will adorn yourself.\n11 Make your vows to Jehovah your God and pay them,\nLet all who are around him bring their gift in fear.\n12 He will humble the pride of leaders;\nHe inspires fear in the kings of the earth.\nPsalm 77\nTo the director; on Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A melody.\n1 With my voice I will cry out to God;\nTo God I will cry out, and he will hear me.\n2 In the day of my distress I search for Jehovah.\nAt night my hands are stretched out to him without ceasing.\nI cannot be comforted.\n3 When I remember God, I groan;\nI am troubled and my strength fails. (Selah)\n4 You hold my eyelids open;\nI am agitated and cannot speak.\n5 My thoughts turn to the days of long ago,\nThe years of the distant past.\n6 During the night I remember my song;\nI ponder in my heart;\nI make a diligent search.\n7 Will Jehovah cast us off forever?\nWill he never again show his favor?\n8 Has his loyal love ceased forever?\nWill his promise come to nothing for all generations?\n9 Has God forgotten to show his favor,\nOr has his anger caused his mercy to cease? (Selah)\n10 Must I keep saying: \"This is what distresses me:\nThe Most High has changed his position toward us\"?\n11 I will remember the works of Jah;\nI will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago.\n12 And I will meditate on all your activity\nAnd ponder over your dealings.\n13 O God, your ways are holy.\nWhat god is as great as you, O God?\n14 You are the true God, who does marvelous things.\nYou have revealed your strength to the peoples.\n15 With your power you have rescued your people,\nThe sons of Jacob and of Joseph. (Selah)\n16 The waters saw you, O God;\nThe waters saw you and were disturbed.\nAnd the deep waters became agitated.\n17 The clouds poured down water.\nThe cloudy skies thundered,\nAnd your arrows flew here and there.\n18 The sound of your thunder was like chariot wheels;\nFlashes of lightning lit up the inhabited earth;\nThe earth trembled and quaked.\n19 Your way was through the sea,\nYour path through many waters;\nBut your footprints could not be traced.\n20 You led your people just like a flock,\nIn the care of Moses and Aaron.\nPsalm 78\nMaskil. Of Asaph.\n1 Listen, my people, to my law;\nIncline your ear to the words of my mouth.\n2 I will open my mouth in a proverb.\nI will propound riddles of long ago.\n3 The things we have heard and know,\nWhich our fathers have related to us,\n4 We will not hide from their sons;\nWe will relate to the generation to come\nThe praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah and his strength,\nThe wonderful things he has done.\n5 He established a reminder in Jacob\nAnd set a law in Israel;\nHe commanded our forefathers\nTo make these things known to their children,\n6 So that the next generation,\nThe children yet to be born, might know them.\nThey in turn would relate them to their children.\n7 Then these would put their confidence in God.\nThey would not forget God's works\nBut would observe his commandments.\n8 Then they would not be like their forefathers,\nA stubborn and rebellious generation,\nA generation whose heart was unsteady\nAnd whose spirit was not faithful to God.\n9 The Ephraimites were armed with the bow,\nBut they retreated in the day of battle.\n10 They did not keep the covenant of God\nAnd refused to walk in his law.\n11 They also forgot what he had done,\nHis wonderful works that he showed them.\n12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their forefathers,\nIn the land of Egypt, the region of Zoan.\n13 He split the sea to let them pass through,\nAnd he made the waters stand up like a dam.\n14 He led them with a cloud by day\nAnd the whole night with the light of a fire.\n15 He split rocks in the wilderness,\nHe let them drink their fill as if from deep waters.\n16 He brought streams out of a crag\nAnd caused waters to flow down like rivers.\n17 But they continued to sin against him\nBy rebelling against the Most High in the desert;\n18 They challenged God in their heart\nBy demanding food that they craved.\n19 So they spoke against God,\nSaying: \"Can God spread a table in the wilderness?\"\n20 Look! He struck a rock\nSo that waters flowed and streams flooded out.\n\"Can he also give us bread,\nOr can he provide meat for his people?\"\n21 When Jehovah heard them, he became furious;\nA fire blazed against Jacob,\nAnd his anger flared up against Israel\n22 Because they did not put faith in God;\nThey did not trust in his ability to save them.\n23 So he commanded the cloudy skies above,\nAnd he opened the doors of heaven.\n24 He kept raining down manna for them to eat;\nHe gave them the grain of heaven.\n25 Men ate the bread of mighty ones;\nHe provided enough to satisfy them.\n26 He stirred up the east wind in the heavens\nAnd made a south wind blow by his power.\n27 And he rained down meat on them like dust,\nBirds like the sand of the seashore.\n28 He made them fall in the midst of his camp,\nAll around his tents.\n29 And they ate and gorged themselves;\nHe gave them what they desired.\n30 But before they fully satisfied their craving,\nWhile their food was yet in their mouth,\n31 God's wrath flared up against them.\nHe put to death their strongest men;\nHe brought down the young men of Israel.\n32 Despite this they sinned even more\nAnd did not put faith in his wonderful works.\n33 So he brought their days to an end as if a mere breath,\nAnd their years by sudden terrors.\n34 But as often as he killed them, they would search for him;\nThey would return and look for God,\n35 Remembering that God was their Rock\nAnd that the Most High God was their Redeemer.\n36 But they tried to deceive him with their mouth\nAnd lied to him with their tongue.\n37 Their heart was not steadfast toward him;\nAnd they were not faithful to his covenant.\n38 But he was merciful;\nHe would forgive their error and not bring them to ruin.\nHe often held back his anger\nInstead of stirring up all his wrath.\n39 For he remembered that they were flesh,\nA wind that blows past and does not return.\n40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness\nAnd made him feel hurt in the desert!\n41 Again and again they put God to the test,\nAnd they grieved the Holy One of Israel.\n42 They did not remember his power,\nThe day that he rescued them from the adversary,\n43 How he displayed his signs in Egypt\nAnd his miracles in the region of Zoan,\n44 And how he turned the Nile canals into blood\nSo that they could not drink from their streams.\n45 He sent swarms of gadflies to devour them\nAnd frogs to bring them to ruin.\n46 He gave their crops to the voracious locusts,\nThe fruit of their labor to the swarming locusts.\n47 He destroyed their vines with hail\nAnd their sycamore trees with hailstones.\n48 He gave their beasts of burden over to the hail\nAnd their livestock to the lightning bolts.\n49 He inflicted his burning anger on them,\nFury and indignation and distress,\nCompanies of angels bringing calamity.\n50 He cleared a pathway for his anger.\nHe did not spare them from death;\nAnd he gave them over to pestilence.\n51 Finally he struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,\nThe beginning of their procreative power in the tents of Ham.\n52 Then he brought his people out like a flock\nAnd guided them like a drove in the wilderness.\n53 He led them in security,\nAnd they felt no fear;\nThe sea covered their enemies.\n54 And he brought them to his holy territory,\nThis mountainous region that his right hand acquired.\n55 He drove out the nations from before them;\nHe allotted to them an inheritance by the measuring line;\nHe settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.\n56 But they kept challenging God the Most High, and rebelling against him;\nThey did not pay attention to his reminders.\n57 They also turned away and were as treacherous as their forefathers.\nThey were as unreliable as a loose bow.\n58 They kept offending him with their high places,\nAnd they incited him to fury with their carved images.\n59 God heard and became furious,\nSo he utterly rejected Israel.\n60 He finally forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,\nThe tent where he had resided among men.\n61 He let the symbol of his strength go into captivity;\nHis splendor into the hand of the adversary.\n62 He handed his people over to the sword\nAnd became furious with his inheritance.\n63 Fire consumed his young men,\nAnd to his virgins no wedding songs were sung.\n64 His priests fell by the sword,\nAnd their own widows did not weep.\n65 Then Jehovah woke up as from sleep,\nLike a mighty man waking up from wine.\n66 And he drove his adversaries back;\nHe put them to lasting disgrace.\n67 He rejected the tent of Joseph;\nHe did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.\n68 But he chose the tribe of Judah,\nMount Zion, which he loves.\n69 He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens,\nLike the earth that he has established forever.\n70 He chose David his servant\nAnd took him from the sheep pens,\n71 From tending the nursing ewes;\nHe made him the shepherd over Jacob, his people,\nAnd over Israel, his inheritance.\n72 He shepherded them with integrity of heart,\nAnd with skillful hands he led them.\nPsalm 79\nA melody of Asaph.\n1 O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;\nThey have defiled your holy temple;\nThey have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins.\n2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the heavens\nAnd the flesh of your loyal ones to the wild beasts of the earth.\n3 They have poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem,\nAnd no one is left to bury them.\n4 We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors;\nThose around us ridicule and jeer us.\n5 How long, O Jehovah, will you be furious? Forever?\nHow long will your indignation burn just like fire?\n6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you\nAnd on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.\n7 For they have devoured Jacob\nAnd have desolated his homeland.\n8 Do not hold us accountable for the errors of our ancestors.\nQuickly show us your mercy,\nFor we have been brought very low.\n9 Help us, O God of our salvation,\nFor the sake of your glorious name;\nRescue us and forgive our sins for the sake of your name.\n10 Why should the nations say: \"Where is their God?\"\nBefore our eyes may it become known among the nations\nThat the shed blood of your servants has been avenged.\n11 May you hear the sighing of the prisoner.\nUse your great power to preserve those sentenced to death.\n12 Repay our neighbors sevenfold\nFor the taunts they have leveled at you, O Jehovah.\n13 Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture,\nWill give thanks to you forever;\nAnd we will declare your praise from generation to generation.\nPsalm 80\nTo the director; set to \"The Lilies.\" A reminder.

(Selah)\n8 You have driven my acquaintances far away from me;\nYou have made me something detestable to them.\nI am trapped and cannot escape.\n9 My eye is worn out because of my affliction.\nI call on you, O Jehovah, all day long;\nTo you I spread out my hands.\n10 Will you perform wonders for the dead?\nCan those powerless in death rise up to praise you? (Selah)\n11 Will your loyal love be declared in the grave,\nYour faithfulness in the place of destruction?\n12 Will your wonders be known in the darkness\nOr your righteousness in the land of oblivion?\n13 But I still cry to you for help, O Jehovah,\nEach morning my prayer comes before you.\n14 Why, O Jehovah, do you reject me?\nWhy do you hide your face from me?\n15 From my youth on,\nI have been afflicted and ready to perish;\nI am numb from the terrible things you allow me to suffer.\n16 Your burning anger overwhelms me;\nYour terrors destroy me.\n17 They surround me like waters all day long;\nThey close in on me from all sides.\n18 You have driven my friends and companions far away from me;\nDarkness has become my companion.\nPsalm 89\nMaskil.

(Selah)\n46 How long, O Jehovah, will you hide yourself? Will it be forever?\nWill your rage continue to burn like a fire?\n47 Remember how short my life is!\nWas it to no purpose that you created all humans?\n48 What man can live and never see death?\nCan he save himself from the power of the Grave?

nights,\n3 Accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument and a lute,\nBy the melodious sound of a harp.\n4 For you have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of your deeds;\nBecause of the works of your hands I shout joyfully.\n5 How great your works are, O Jehovah!\nHow very deep your thoughts are!\n6 No unreasoning man can know them;\nAnd no foolish person can understand this:\n7 When the wicked sprout like weeds\nAnd all the wrongdoers flourish,\nIt is that they may be annihilated forever.\n8 But you are exalted forever, O Jehovah.\n9 Indeed, look in triumph on your enemies, O Jehovah,\nLook at how your enemies will perish;\nAll the wrongdoers will be scattered.\n10 But you will exalt my strength like that of a wild bull;\nI will moisten my skin with fresh oil.\n11 My eyes will look in triumph on my foes;\nMy ears will hear about the downfall of the evil men who attack me.\n12 But the righteous will flourish like a palm tree\nAnd grow big like a cedar in Lebanon.\n13 They are planted in the house of Jehovah;\nThey flourish in the courtyards of our God.\n14 Even in old age they will still be thriving;\nThey will remain vigorous and fresh,\n15 Declaring that Jehovah is upright.\nHe is my Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.\nPsalm 93\n1 Jehovah has become King!\nWith grandeur he is clothed;\nJehovah is clothed with strength;\nHe wears it like a belt.\nThe earth is firmly established;\nIt cannot be moved.\n2 Your throne was firmly established long ago;\nFrom eternity you have existed.\n3 The rivers have surged, O Jehovah,\nThe rivers have surged and

what they deserve.\n3 How long will the wicked, O Jehovah,\nHow long will the wicked continue to exult?\n4 They babble and speak arrogantly;\nAll the wrongdoers brag about themselves.\n5 They crush your people, O Jehovah,\nAnd oppress your inheritance.\n6 They kill the widow and the foreign resident,\nAnd they murder the fatherless children.\n7 They say: \"Jah does not see;\nThe God of Jacob does not take notice of it.\"\n8 Understand this, you who are unreasoning;\nYou foolish ones, when will you ever show insight?\n9 The One who made the ear, can he not hear?\nThe One who formed the eye, can he not see?\n10 The One correcting the nations, can he not reprove?\nHe is the One who imparts knowledge to people!\n11 Jehovah knows the thoughts of men,\nThat they are but a mere breath.\n12 Happy is the man whom you correct, O Jah,\nWhom you teach from your law,\n13 To give him tranquility during days of calamity,\nUntil a pit is dug for the wicked.\n14 For Jehovah will not forsake his people,\nNor will he abandon his inheritance.\n15 For judgment will once again be righteous,\nAnd all the upright in heart will follow it.\n16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked?\nWho will take a stand for me against the wrongdoers?\n17 If Jehovah had not been my helper,\nI would soon have perished.\n18 When I said: \"My foot is slipping,\"\nYour loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me.\n19 When anxieties overwhelmed me,\nYou comforted and soothed me.\n20 Can a throne of corruption be allied with you\nWhile it is framing trouble in the name of the law?\n21 They make vicious attacks on the righteous one\nAnd condemn the innocent one to death.\n22 But Jehovah will become a secure refuge for me,\nMy God is my rock of refuge.\n23 He will make their wicked deeds come back upon them.\nHe will do away with them by means of their own evil.\nJehovah our God will do away with them.\nPsalm 95\n1 Come, let us shout joyfully to Jehovah!\nLet us shout in triumph to

before Jehovah our Maker.\n7 For he is our God,\nAnd we are the people of his pasture,\nThe sheep in his care.\nToday if you listen to his voice,\n8 Do not harden your heart as at Meribah,\nAs in the day of Massah in the wilderness,\n9 When your forefathers tested me;\nThey challenged me, though they had seen my works.\n10 For 40 years I felt a loathing toward that generation, and I said:\n\"They are a people who always go astray in their hearts;\nThey have not come to know my ways.\"\n11 So I swore in my anger:\n\"They will not enter into my rest.\"\nPsalm 96\n1 Sing to Jehovah a new

to judge the earth.\nHe will judge the inhabited earth with righteousness\nAnd the peoples with his faithfulness.\nPsalm 97\n1 Jehovah has become King!\nLet the earth be joyful.\nLet the many islands rejoice.\n2 Clouds and thick gloom are all around him;\nRighteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.\n3 Fire goes before him\nAnd consumes his adversaries on every side.\n4 His lightning bolts light up the land;\nThe earth sees it and trembles.\n5 The mountains melt like wax before Jehovah,\nBefore the Lord of the whole earth.\n6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness,\nAnd all the peoples see his glory.\n7 Let all those serving any carved image be put to shame,\nThose who boast about their worthless gods.\nBow down to him, all you gods.\n8 Zion hears and rejoices;\nThe towns of Judah are joyful\nBecause of your judgments, O Jehovah.\n9 For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth;\nYou are exalted far above all other gods.\n10 O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.\nHe is guarding the lives of his loyal ones;\nHe rescues them from the hand of the wicked.\n11 Light has flashed up for the righteous\nAnd rejoicing for those upright in heart.\n12

righteousness\nAnd the peoples with fairness.\nPsalm 99\n1 Jehovah has become King. Let the peoples tremble.\nHe sits enthroned above the cherubs. Let the earth shake.\n2 Jehovah is great in Zion,\nAnd he is high over all the peoples.\n3 Let them praise your great name,\nFor it is awe-inspiring and holy.\n4 He is a mighty king who loves justice.\nYou have firmly established what is upright.\nYou have brought about justice and righteousness in Jacob.\n5 Exalt Jehovah our God and bow down at his footstool;\nHe is holy.\n6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests,\nAnd Samuel was among those calling on his name.\nThey would call to Jehovah,\nAnd he would answer them.\n7 He would speak to them from the pillar of cloud.\nThey kept his reminders and the decree that he gave to them.\n8 O Jehovah our God, you answered them.\nYou were a God who pardoned them,\nBut you punished them for their sinful deeds.\n9 Exalt Jehovah our God\nAnd bow down before his holy mountain,\nFor Jehovah our God is holy.\nPsalm 100\nA melody of thanksgiving.\n1 Shout in triumph to Jehovah, all the earth.\n2 Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.\nCome into his presence with joyful shouting.\n3 Know that Jehovah is God.\nHe is the one who made us, and we belong to him.\nWe are his people and the sheep of his pasture.\n4 Come into his gates with thanksgiving,\nInto his courtyards with praise.\nGive thanks to him; praise his name.\n5 For Jehovah is good;\nHis loyal love endures forever,\nAnd his faithfulness through all generations.\nPsalm 101\nOf David. A melody.\n1 I will sing about loyal love and justice.\nTo you, O Jehovah, I will sing praises.\n2 I will act with discretion and blamelessness.\nWhen will you come to me?\nI will walk with integrity of heart inside my house.\n3 I will not set anything worthless before my eyes.\nI hate the deeds of those who deviate from what is right;\nI will have nothing to do with them.\n4 A crooked heart is far from me;\nI will not accept what is bad.\n5 Anyone slandering his neighbor in secret,\nI will silence.\nAnyone with haughty eyes and an arrogant heart,\nI will not tolerate.\n6 I will look to the faithful ones of the earth,\nSo that they may dwell with me.\nThe one walking in blamelessness will minister to me.\n7 No deceitful person will dwell in my house,\nAnd no liar will stand in my presence.\n8 Every morning I will silence all the wicked of the earth,\nTo cut off all wrongdoers from the city of Jehovah.\nPsalm 102\nA prayer of the oppressed one when he is in despair and pours out his concern before Jehovah.\n1 O Jehovah, hear my prayer;\nLet my cry for help reach you.\n2 Do not hide your face from me in my time of distress.\nIncline your ear to me;\nDo answer me quickly when I call.\n3 For my days are vanishing like smoke,\nAnd my bones are charred like a fireplace.\n4 My heart has been struck down like grass and has withered,\nFor I forget to eat my food.\n5 Because of my loud groaning,\nMy bones cling to my flesh.\n6 I resemble the pelican of the wilderness;\nI am like a little owl among the ruins.\n7 I lie awake;\nI am like a solitary bird on a roof.\n8 All day long my enemies taunt me.\nThose who mock me use my name as a curse.\n9 For I eat ashes as my bread,\nAnd my drink is mingled with tears,\n10 Because of your anger and your indignation,\nFor you lifted me up only to cast me aside.\n11 My days are like a fading shadow,\nAnd I am withering like grass.\n12 But you remain forever, O Jehovah,\nAnd your fame will endure for all generations.\n13 Surely you will rise up and show mercy on Zion,\nFor it is time to show her your favor;\nThe appointed time has come.\n14 For your servants find pleasure in her stones\nAnd have affection even for her dust.\n15 The nations will fear the name of Jehovah,\nAnd all the kings of the earth your glory.\n16 For Jehovah will rebuild Zion;\nHe will appear in his glory.\n17 He will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute;\nHe will not despise their prayer.\n18 This is written for the future generation,\nSo that a people yet to be brought forth will praise Jah.\n19 For he looks down from his holy height,\nFrom the heavens Jehovah views the earth,\n20 To hear the sighing of the prisoner,\nTo release those sentenced to death,\n21 So that the name of Jehovah will be declared in Zion\nAnd his praise in Jerusalem,\n22 When the peoples and kingdoms\nGather together to serve Jehovah.\n23 He prematurely robbed me of my strength;\nHe cut short my days.\n24 I said: \"O my God,\nDo not do away with me in the middle of my life,\nYou whose years span all generations.\n25 Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth,\nAnd the heavens are the work of your hands.\n26 They will perish, but you will remain;\nJust like a garment they will all wear out.\nJust like clothing you will replace them, and they will pass away.\n27 But you are the same, and your years will never end.\n28 The children of your servants will dwell securely,\nAnd their offspring will be firmly established before you.\"\nPsalm 103\nOf David.\n1 Let me praise Jehovah;\nLet everything within me praise his holy name.\n2 Let me praise Jehovah;\nMay I never forget all that he has done.\n3 He forgives all your errors\nAnd heals all your ailments;\n4 He reclaims your life from the pit\nAnd crowns you with his loyal love and mercy.\n5 He satisfies you with good things all your life,\nSo that your youth is renewed like that of an eagle.\n6 Jehovah acts with righteousness and justice\nFor all who are oppressed.\n7 He made known his ways to Moses,\nHis deeds to the sons of Israel.\n8 Jehovah is merciful and compassionate,\nSlow to anger and abundant in loyal love.\n9 He will not always find fault,\nNor will he stay resentful forever.\n10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins,\nNor has he repaid us what our errors deserve.\n11 For as the heavens are higher than the earth,\nSo great is his loyal love toward those who fear him.\n12 As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset,\nSo far off from us he has put our transgressions.\n13 As a father shows mercy to his sons,\nJehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.\n14 For he well knows how we are formed,\nRemembering that we are dust.\n15 As for mortal man, his days are like those of grass;\nHe blooms like a blossom of the field.\n16 But when a wind blows, it is no more,\nAs though it was never there.\n17 But the loyal love of Jehovah is for all eternity\nToward those who fear him,\nAnd his righteousness toward their children's children,\n18 Toward those who keep his covenant\nAnd those who are careful to observe his orders.\n19 Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens;\nAnd his kingship rules over everything.\n20 Praise Jehovah, all you his angels, mighty in power,\nWho carry out his word, obeying his voice.\n21 Praise Jehovah, all his armies,\nHis ministers who do his will.\n22 Praise Jehovah, all his works,\nIn all the places where he rules.\nLet my whole being praise Jehovah.\nPsalm 104\n1 Let me praise Jehovah.\nO Jehovah my God, you are very great.\nWith majesty and splendor you are clothed.\n2 You are wrapped in light as with a garment;\nYou stretch out the heavens like a tent cloth.\n3 He lays beams of his upper rooms in the waters above,\nMaking the clouds his chariot,\nMoving on the wings of the wind.\n4 He makes his angels spirits,\nHis ministers a consuming fire.\n5 He has established the earth on its foundations;\nIt will not be moved from its place forever and ever.\n6 You covered it with deep waters as with a garment.\nThe waters stood above the mountains.\n7 At your rebuke they fled;\nAt the sound of your thunder they ran away in panic\n8 -Mountains ascended and valleys descended-\nTo the place you established for them.\n9 You set a boundary that they should not pass,\nThat they should never again cover the earth.\n10 He sends springs into the valleys;\nBetween the mountains they flow.\n11 They provide water for all the wild beasts of the field;\nThe wild donkeys quench their thirst.\n12 Above them roost the birds of the sky;\nThey sing among the thick foliage.\n13 He is watering the mountains from his upper rooms.\nWith the fruitage of your works the earth is satisfied.\n14 He is making grass grow for the cattle\nAnd vegetation for mankind's use,\nTo grow food from the land\n15 And wine that makes man's heart rejoice,\nOil that makes the face shine,\nAnd bread that sustains the heart of mortal man.\n16 The trees of Jehovah are satisfied,\nThe cedars of Lebanon that he planted,\n17 Where the birds make nests.\nThe home of the stork is in the juniper trees.\n18 The high mountains are for the mountain goats;\nThe crags are a refuge for the rock badgers.\n19 He has made the moon to mark the appointed times;\nThe sun well knows when to set.\n20 You bring darkness, and night falls,\nWhen all the wild animals of the forest roam about.\n21 The young lions roar for their prey\nAnd seek their food from God.\n22 When the sun rises,\nThey withdraw and lie down in their dens.\n23 Man goes to his work,\nAnd he labors until evening.\n24 How many your works are, O Jehovah!\nYou have made all of them in wisdom.\nThe earth is full of what you have made.\n25 There is the sea, so great and wide,\nTeeming with countless living things, both small and great.\n26 There the ships travel,\nAnd Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.\n27 All of them wait for you\nTo give them their food in its season.\n28 What you give them, they gather.\nWhen you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.\n29 When you hide your face, they are disturbed.\nIf you take away their spirit, they die and return to the dust.\n30 If you send out your spirit, they are created,\nAnd you renew the surface of the ground.\n31 The glory of Jehovah will last forever.\nJehovah will rejoice in his works.\n32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles;\nHe touches the mountains, and they smoke.\n33 I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life;\nI will sing praises to my God as long as I live.\n34 Let my thoughts be pleasing to him.\nI will rejoice in Jehovah.\n35 The sinners will vanish from the earth,\nAnd the wicked will no longer exist.\nLet me praise Jehovah. Praise Jah!\nPsalm 105\n1 Give thanks to Jehovah, call on his name,\nMake his deeds known among the peoples!\n2 Sing to him, sing praises to him,\nPonder over all his wonderful works.\n3 Boast about his holy name.\nLet the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.\n4 Search for Jehovah and his strength.\nSeek his face constantly.\n5 Remember the wonderful works he has performed,\nHis miracles and the judgments he has pronounced,\n6 You offspring of Abraham his servant,\nYou sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.\n7 He is Jehovah our God.\nHis judgments are throughout the earth.\n8 He remembers his covenant forever,\nThe promise he made, to a thousand generations,\n9 The covenant he made with Abraham,\nAnd the oath he swore to Isaac,\n10 Which he established as a decree to Jacob\nAnd as a lasting covenant to Israel,\n11 Saying, \"I will give you the land of Canaan\nAs your allotted inheritance.\"\n12 This was when they were few in number,\nYes, very few, and they were foreigners in the land.\n13 They walked about from nation to nation,\nFrom one kingdom to another people.\n14 He did not allow any man to oppress them,\nBut on their account he reproved kings,\n15 Saying, \"Do not touch my anointed ones,\nAnd to my prophets do nothing bad.\"\n16 He called down a famine on the land;\nHe cut off their supply of bread.\n17 He sent ahead of them a man\nWho was sold to be a slave, Joseph.\n18 With fetters they bound his feet,\nHis neck was put in irons;\n19 Until the time that his word proved true,\nThe saying of Jehovah is what refined him.\n20 The king sent to release him,\nThe ruler of the peoples set him free.\n21 He made him master of his household,\nRuler over all his property,\n22 To have authority over his princes as he pleased\nAnd to teach his elders wisdom.\n23 Then Israel came into Egypt,\nAnd Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.\n24 God made his people very fruitful;\nHe made them mightier than their adversaries,\n25 Whose hearts he let change to hate his people,\nTo plot against his servants.\n26 He sent his servant Moses,\nAnd Aaron, whom he had chosen.\n27 They performed his signs among them,\nHis miracles in the land of Ham.\n28 He sent darkness and the land became dark;\nThey did not rebel against his words.\n29 He changed their waters into blood\nAnd killed their fish.\n30 Their land swarmed with frogs,\nEven in the royal chambers.\n31 He ordered the gadflies to invade\nAnd gnats in all their territories.\n32 He turned their rain to hail\nAnd sent lightning on their land.\n33 He struck their vines and their fig trees\nAnd shattered the trees of their territory.\n34 He said that the locusts should invade,\nYoung locusts without number.\n35 They devoured all the vegetation in the land,\nAnd they devoured the produce of the ground.\n36 Then he struck down every firstborn in their land,\nThe beginning of their procreative power.\n37 He brought his people out with silver and gold;\nAnd no one among his tribes stumbled.\n38 Egypt rejoiced when they left,\nFor the dread of Israel had fallen on them.\n39 He spread a cloud to screen them off\nAnd fire to give light by night.\n40 They asked, and he brought quail;\nHe kept satisfying them with bread from heaven.\n41 He opened a rock, and waters flowed out;\nThese flowed through the desert like a river.\n42 For he remembered the holy promise he had made to Abraham his servant.\n43 So he brought out his people with exultation,\nHis chosen ones with a joyful cry.\n44 He gave them the lands of nations;\nThey inherited what other peoples had worked hard to produce,\n45 So that they would keep his decrees\nAnd observe his laws.\nPraise Jah!\nPsalm 106\n1 Praise Jah!\nGive thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;\nHis loyal love endures forever.\n2 Who can fully declare Jehovah's mighty acts\nOr proclaim all his praiseworthy deeds?\n3 Happy are those who act with justice,\nWho always do what is right.\n4 Remember me, O Jehovah, when you show favor toward your people.\nTake care of me with your acts of salvation,\n5 So that I may enjoy the goodness you show your chosen ones,\nThat I may rejoice along with your nation,\nThat I may proudly praise you along with your inheritance.\n6 We have sinned just as our forefathers did;\nWe have done wrong; we have acted wickedly.\n7 Our forefathers in Egypt did not appreciate your wonderful works.\nThey did not remember your abundant loyal love,\nBut they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.\n8 But he saved them for the sake of his name,\nTo make his mightiness known.\n9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;\nHe led them through its depths as through a desert;\n10 He saved them from the hand of their foe\nAnd reclaimed them from the hand of the enemy.\n11 The waters covered their adversaries;\nNot one of them survived.\n12 Then they had faith in his promise;\nThey began to sing his praise.\n13 But they quickly forgot what he did;\nThey did not wait for his counsel.\n14 They gave way to their selfish desires in the wilderness;\nThey tested God in the desert.\n15 He gave them what they requested,\nBut then struck them with disease that made them waste away.\n16 In the camp they grew jealous of Moses\nAnd of Aaron, the holy one of Jehovah.\n17 The earth then opened up and swallowed Dathan\nAnd covered those assembled with Abiram.\n18 A fire blazed among their group;\nA flame consumed the wicked.\n19 They made a calf in Horeb\nAnd bowed down to a statue of metal;\n20 They exchanged my glory\nFor the representation of a grass-eating bull.\n21 They forgot God their Savior,\nWho did great things in Egypt,\n22 Wonderful works in the land of Ham,\nAwe-inspiring deeds at the Red Sea.\n23 He was about to order their annihilation,\nBut Moses his chosen one interceded with him\nTo avert his destructive anger.\n24 Then they despised the desirable land;\nThey had no faith in his promise.\n25 They kept grumbling in their tents;\nThey did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.\n26 So he raised his hand in an oath concerning them\nThat he would make them fall in the wilderness;\n27 He would make their descendants fall among the nations,\nAnd he would scatter them throughout the lands.\n28 Then they joined in worship of Baal of Peor,\nAnd they ate sacrifices offered to the dead.\n29 They provoked Him by their actions,\nAnd a scourge broke out among them.\n30 But when Phinehas stood up and intervened,\nThe scourge was halted.\n31 And it was counted to him as righteousness\nThrough all generations forever.\n32 They provoked Him at the waters of Meribah,\nAnd it went badly for Moses because of them.\n33 They embittered his spirit,\nAnd he spoke rashly with his lips.\n34 They did not annihilate the peoples,\nAs Jehovah had commanded them.\n35 But they mingled with the nations\nAnd adopted their ways.\n36 They kept serving their idols,\nAnd these became a snare to them.\n37 They would sacrifice their sons\nAnd their daughters to demons.\n38 They kept spilling innocent blood,\nThe blood of their own sons and daughters\nWhom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;\nAnd the land was polluted with bloodshed.\n39 They became unclean by their works;\nThey committed spiritual prostitution by their deeds.\n40 So the anger of Jehovah blazed against his people,\nAnd he grew to detest his inheritance.\n41 He repeatedly handed them over to the nations,\nSo that those who hated them might rule over them.\n42 Their enemies oppressed them,\nAnd they were subject to their power.\n43 Many times he rescued them,\nBut they would rebel and disobey,\nAnd they would be brought low for their error.\n44 But he would see their distress\nAnd hear their cry for help.\n45 For their sake he would remember his covenant,\nAnd he would feel pity, moved by his great loyal love.\n46 He would cause them to be pitied\nBy all who held them captive.\n47 Save us, O Jehovah our God,\nAnd gather us from the nations\nSo that we may give thanks to your holy name\nAnd exult in praising you.\n48 May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praised\nThroughout all eternity.\nAnd let all the people say, \"Amen!\"\nPraise Jah!\nBook Five\n(Psalms 107-150)\nPsalm 107\n1 Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;\nHis loyal love endures forever.\n2 Let those reclaimed by Jehovah say this,\nThose whom he reclaimed from the hand of the adversary,\n3 Whom he gathered together from the lands,\nFrom the east and from the west,\nFrom the north and from the south.\n4 They wandered about in the wilderness, in the desert;\nThey did not find a way to a city where they could live.\n5 They were hungry and thirsty;\nThey were faint from exhaustion.\n6 They kept crying out to Jehovah in their distress;\nHe rescued them from their plight.\n7 He had them walk in the right way\nTo come to a city where they could live.\n8 Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal love\nAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.\n9 For he has satisfied the thirsty\nAnd filled the hungry with good things.\n10 Some were living in deepest darkness,\nPrisoners in affliction and in irons.\n11 For they had rebelled against the word of God;\nThey disrespected the counsel of the Most High.\n12 So he humbled their hearts through hardship;\nThey stumbled, and there was no one to help them.\n13 They called to Jehovah for help in their distress;\nHe saved them from their plight.\n14 He brought them out of deepest darkness,\nAnd he tore off their shackles.\n15 Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal love\nAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.\n16 For he has broken down the doors of copper\nAnd cut through the bars of iron.\n17 They were foolish and suffered affliction\nOn account of their transgressions and their errors.\n18 They lost their appetite for all food;\nThey drew near the gates of death.\n19 They would call to Jehovah for help in their distress;\nHe would save them from their plight.\n20 He would send his word and heal them\nAnd rescue them from the pits they were trapped in.\n21 Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal love\nAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.\n22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving\nAnd declare his works with a joyful cry.\n23 Those who travel on the sea in ships,\nWho ply their trade over the vast waters,\n24 They have seen the works of Jehovah\nAnd his wonderful works in the deep;\n25 How by his word a windstorm arises,\nLifting up the waves of the sea.\n26 They rise up to the sky;\nThey plunge down to the depths.\nTheir courage melts away because of the impending calamity.\n27 They reel and stagger like a drunken man,\nAnd all their skill proves useless.\n28 Then they cry out to Jehovah in their distress,\nAnd he rescues them from their plight.\n29 He calms the windstorm;\nThe waves of the sea grow quiet.\n30 They rejoice when these grow still,\nAnd he leads them to their desired harbor.\n31 Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal love\nAnd for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men.\n32 Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people,\nAnd let them praise him in the council of the elders.\n33 He turns rivers into a desert\nAnd springs of water into parched ground,\n34 Fruitful land into salty wasteland,\nBecause of the wickedness of those dwelling in it.\n35 He turns the desert into reedy pools of water,\nAnd dry land into springs of water.\n36 He causes the hungry to dwell there,\nSo that they may establish a city where they can live.\n37 They sow fields and plant vineyards\nThat yield fruitful crops.\n38 He blesses them and they increase greatly;\nHe does not let their cattle diminish.\n39 But again they become few and are humiliated\nBecause of oppression, calamity, and grief.\n40 He pours out contempt upon nobles\nAnd makes them wander in trackless wastelands.\n41 But he protects the poor from oppression\nAnd makes their families as numerous as a flock.\n42 The upright see this and rejoice;\nBut all the unrighteous shut their mouths.\n43 Whoever is wise will observe these things\nAnd will carefully consider Jehovah's acts of loyal love.\nPsalm 108\nA song. A melody of David.\n1 My heart is steadfast, O God.\nI will sing and make music with my whole being.\n2 Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp.\nI will awaken the dawn.\n3 I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah,\nAnd I will sing praises to you among the nations.\n4 For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens,\nAnd your faithfulness, up to the skies.\n5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God;\nMay your glory be over all the earth.\n6 So that your loved ones may be rescued,\nSave us with your right hand and answer me.\n7 God has spoken in his holiness:\n\"I will exult, I will give out Shechem as an inheritance,\nAnd I will measure off the Valley of Succoth.\n8 Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh,\nAnd Ephraim is the helmet for my head;\nJudah is my commander's staff.\n9 Moab is my washbasin.\nOver Edom I will throw my sandal.\nOver Philistia I will shout in triumph.\"\n10 Who will bring me to the fortified city?\nWho will lead me as far as Edom?\n11 Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us,\nOur God, who no longer goes out with our armies?\n12 Help us in our distress,\nFor salvation by humans is worthless.\n13 By God we will gain power,\nAnd he will trample on our adversaries.\nPsalm 109\nTo the director. Of David. A melody.\n1 O God whom I praise, do not remain silent.\n2 For the wicked and the deceitful open their mouths against me.\nThey speak about me with lying tongues;\n3 They surround me with hateful words,\nAnd they attack me without cause.\n4 They resist me in response to my love;\nBut I continue to pray.\n5 They repay me with bad for good\nAnd hatred for my love.\n6 Appoint a wicked man over him;\nMay a resister stand at his right hand.\n7 When he is judged, may he be found guilty;\nMay even his prayer be counted as a sin.\n8 Let his days be few;\nHis office of oversight let someone else take.\n9 Let his children become fatherless,\nAnd his wife, a widow.\n10 May his children become wandering beggars,\nForaging for food from their ruined homes.\n11 May his creditor seize all that he has,\nAnd may strangers plunder his possessions.\n12 May no one extend kindness to him,\nAnd may no one show favor to his fatherless children.\n13 Let his descendants be cut off;\nMay their name be erased within a generation.\n14 Let the error of his forefathers be remembered by Jehovah,\nAnd may the sin of his mother not be erased.\n15 May Jehovah always be mindful of what they have done;\nAnd may he cut off the memory of them from the earth.\n16 For he did not remember to show kindness,\nBut he kept pursuing the oppressed, poor, and brokenhearted man\nTo put him to death.\n17 He loved to pronounce a curse, so that is what came upon him;\nHe had no desire to bless, so he received no blessing.\n18 He was clothed with curses as his garment.\nAnd they were poured into his body like water,\nInto his bones like oil.\n19 May his curses be like the clothing in which he wraps himself\nAnd like a belt he always wears.\n20 This is the payment from Jehovah for the one who resists me\nAnd for those who speak evil things against me.\n21 But you, Jehovah the Sovereign Lord,\nAct in my behalf for the sake of your name.\nRescue me, because your loyal love is good.\n22 For I am helpless and poor,\nAnd my heart has been pierced within me.\n23 I am passing away like a fading shadow;\nI have been shaken off like a locust.\n24 My knees give way from fasting;\nMy body is thin, and I am wasting away.\n25 I have become the object of their taunts.\nWhen they see me, they shake their heads.\n26 Help me, O Jehovah my God;\nSave me by your loyal love.\n27 May they know that this is by your hand;\nThat you, O Jehovah, have done it.\n28 Let them pronounce a curse, but may you give a blessing.\nWhen they rise up against me, may they be put to shame,\nBut let your servant rejoice.\n29 Let those who resist me be clothed with humiliation;\nMay they be wrapped in their shame as in a robe.\n30 My mouth will fervently praise Jehovah;\nI will praise him in front of many people.\n31 For he will stand at the right hand of the poor\nTo save him from those who condemn him.\nPsalm 110\nOf David. A melody.\n1 Jehovah declared to my Lord:\n\"Sit at my right hand\nUntil I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.\"\n2 Jehovah will extend the scepter of your power out of Zion, saying:\n\"Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.\"\n3 Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.\nIn splendid holiness, from the womb of the dawn,\nYou have your company of young men just like dewdrops.\n4 Jehovah has sworn an oath, and he will not change his mind:\n\"You are a priest forever\nIn the manner of Melchizedek!\"\n5 Jehovah will be at your right hand;\nHe will crush kings on the day of his anger.\n6 He will execute judgment against the nations;\nHe will fill the land with dead bodies.\nHe will crush the leader of a vast land.\n7 He will drink from the stream along the road.\nTherefore, he will hold his head high.\nPsalm 111\n1 Praise Jah!\n?

How good and how pleasant it is\nFor brothers to dwell together in unity!\n2 It is like fine oil poured on the head\nThat runs down the beard,\nAaron's beard,\nAnd runs down onto the collar of his garments.\n3 It is like the dew of Hermon\nThat descends on the mountains of Zion.\nThat is where Jehovah decreed his blessing\n-Life everlasting.\nPsalm 134\nA Song of the Ascents.\n1 Praise Jehovah,\nAll you servants of Jehovah,\nYou who stand in the house of Jehovah during the nights.\n2 Raise your hands in holiness\nAnd praise Jehovah.\n3 May Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth,\nBless you from Zion.\nPsalm 135\n1 Praise Jah!\nPraise the name of Jehovah;\nOffer praise, you servants of Jehovah,\n2 You who are standing in the house of Jehovah,\nIn the courtyards of the house of our God.\n3 Praise Jah, for Jehovah is good.\nSing praises to his name, for it is pleasant.\n4 For Jah has chosen Jacob for himself,\nIsrael for his special property.\n5 For I well know that Jehovah is great;\nOur Lord is greater than all other gods.\n6 Jehovah does everything he pleases to do\nIn heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths.\n7 He causes clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth;\nHe makes lightning for the rain;\nHe brings the wind out of his storehouses.\n8 He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,\nBoth man and beast.\n9 He sent signs and miracles among you, O Egypt,\nAgainst Pharaoh and all his servants.\n10 He struck down many nations\nAnd killed mighty kings\n11 -Sihon the king of the Amorites,\nOg the king of Bashan,\nAnd all the kingdoms of Canaan.\n12 He gave their land as an inheritance,\nAn inheritance to Israel his people.\n13 O Jehovah, your name endures forever.\nO Jehovah, your fame endures for all generations.\n14 For Jehovah will defend his people,\nAnd he will feel compassion for his servants.\n15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,\nThe work of human hands.\n16 A mouth they have, but they cannot speak;\nEyes, but they cannot see;\n17 Ears they have, but they cannot hear.\nThere is no breath in their mouth.\n18 The people who make them will become just like them,\nAs will all those who trust in them.\n19 O house of Israel, praise Jehovah.\nO house of Aaron, praise Jehovah.\n20 O house of Levi, praise Jehovah.\nYou who fear Jehovah, praise Jehovah.\n21 May Jehovah be praised from Zion,\nThe One residing in Jerusalem.\nPraise Jah!\nPsalm 136\n1 Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;\nHis loyal love endures forever.\n2 Give thanks to the God of gods,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n3 Give thanks to the Lord of lords,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n4 He alone does great wonders,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n5 He skillfully made the heavens,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n6 He spread out the earth over the waters,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n7 He made the great lights,\nFor his loyal love endures forever,\n8 The sun to rule over the day,\nFor his loyal love endures forever,\n9 The moon and the stars to rule over the night,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n10 He struck down Egypt's firstborn,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n11 He

love endures forever.\n24 He kept rescuing us from our adversaries,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n25 He gives food to every living thing,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\n26 Give thanks to the God of the heavens,\nFor his loyal love endures forever.\nPsalm 137\n1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat.\nWe wept when we remembered Zion.\n2 Upon the poplar trees in her midst,\nWe hung our harps.\n3 For there our captors asked us for a song,\nThose mocking us wanted amusement:\n\"Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.\"\n4 How can we sing the song of Jehovah\nOn foreign soil?\n5 If I should forget you, O Jerusalem,\nLet my right hand be forgetful.\n6 Let my tongue stick to my palate\nIf I do not remember you,\nIf I do not place Jerusalem above\nMy greatest reasons for rejoicing.\n7 Remember, O Jehovah,\nWhat the Edomites said on the day Jerusalem fell:\n\"Tear it down! Tear it down to its foundations!\"\n8 O daughter of Babylon, who is soon to be devastated,\nHappy will be the one who rewards you\nWith the treatment you inflicted on us.\n9 Happy will be the one who seizes your children\nAnd dashes them against the rocks.\nPsalm 138\nOf David.\n1 I will praise you with all my heart.\nIn the face of other gods,\nI will sing praises.\n2 I will bow down toward your holy temple,\nAnd I will praise your name\nBecause of your loyal love and your faithfulness.\nFor you have magnified your saying and your name above everything else.\n3 On the day I called, you answered me;\nYou made me bold and strong.\n4 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Jehovah,\nFor they will have heard the promises you have spoken.\n5 They will sing about the ways of Jehovah,\nFor the glory of Jehovah is great.\n6 Though Jehovah is high, he takes note of the humble,\nBut the haughty he knows only from a distance.\n7 Even when I walk in the midst of danger, you will preserve me alive.\nYou stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies;\nYour right hand will save me.\n8 Jehovah will accomplish all things in my behalf.\nO Jehovah, your loyal love endures forever;\nDo not forsake the works of your hands.\nPsalm 139\nFor the director. Of David. A melody.\n1 O Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know me.\n2 You know when I sit down and when I rise up.\nYou discern my thoughts from afar.\n3 You observe me when I travel and when I lie down;\nYou are familiar with all my ways.\n4 There is not a word on my tongue,\nBut look! O Jehovah, you already know it well.\n5 Behind and before me, you surround me;\nAnd you lay your hand upon me.\n6 Such knowledge is beyond my comprehension.\nIt is too high for me to reach.\n7 Where can I escape from your spirit,\nAnd where can I run away from your face?\n8 If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there,\nAnd if I were to make my bed in the Grave, look! you would be there.\n9 If I would fly away with the wings of the dawn\nTo reside by the most remote sea,\n10 Even there your hand would lead me\nAnd your right hand would take hold of me.\n11 If I say: \"Surely darkness will conceal me!\"\nThen the night around me would become light.\n12 Even the darkness would not be too dark for you,\nBut night would be as bright as the day;\nDarkness is the same as light to you.\n13 For you produced my kidneys;\nYou kept me screened off in my mother's womb.\n14 I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.\nYour works are wonderful,\nI know this very well.\n15 My bones were not hidden from you\nWhen I was made in secret,\nWhen I was woven in the depths of the earth.\n16 Your eyes even saw me as an embryo;\nAll its parts were written in your book\nRegarding the days when they were formed,\nBefore any of them existed.\n17 So to me, how precious your thoughts are!\nO God, how vast is the sum of them!\n18 If I try to count them, they outnumber the grains of sand.\nWhen I awake, I am still with you.\n19 O God, if only you would slay the wicked!\nThen the violent men would depart from me,\n20 Those who say things against you with evil intent;\nThey are your adversaries who take up your name in a worthless way.\n21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O Jehovah,\nAnd loathe those who revolt against you?\n22 I have nothing but hatred for them;\nThey have become real enemies to me.\n23 Search through me, O God, and know my heart.\nExamine me, and know my anxious thoughts.\n24 See whether there is in me any harmful way,\nAnd lead me in the way of eternity.\nPsalm 140\nFor the director. A melody of David.\n1 Rescue me, O Jehovah, from evil men;\nProtect me from violent men,\n2 Those who scheme evil in their hearts\nAnd stir up conflict all day long.\n3 They sharpen their tongue like that of a serpent;\nVenom of vipers is behind their lips. (Selah)\n4 Protect me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked;\nSafeguard me from violent men,\nThose who scheme to trip me.\n5 The haughty ones hide a trap for me;\nWith ropes they spread out a net beside the path.\nThey set snares for me. (Selah)\n6 I say to Jehovah: \"You are my God.\nListen, O Jehovah, to my pleas for help.\"\n7 O Jehovah the Sovereign Lord, my strong Savior,\nYou shield my head in the day of battle.\n8 Do not grant, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked.\nDo not let their plots succeed, so that they are not exalted. (Selah)\n9 May the heads of those surrounding me\nBe covered with the evil spoken by their lips.\n10 May burning coals rain down on them.\nMay they be hurled into the fire,\nInto deep pits, never to rise again.\n11 May the slanderer find no place on the earth.\nMay evil pursue men of violence and strike them down.\n12 I know that Jehovah will defend the lowly\nAnd give justice to the poor.\n13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name;\nThe upright will dwell before your face.\nPsalm 141\nA melody of David.\n1 O Jehovah, I call on you.\nCome quickly to help me.\nDo pay attention when I call to you.\n2 May my prayer be as incense prepared before you,\nMy uplifted hands like the evening grain offering.\n3 Station a guard for my mouth, O Jehovah,\nDo set a watch over the door of my lips.\n4 Do not let my heart incline to anything bad,\nTo share in vile deeds with evil men;\nMay I never feast on their delicacies.\n5 Should the righteous one strike me, it would be an act of loyal love;\nShould he reprove me, it would be like oil on my head,\nWhich my head would never refuse.\nMy prayer will continue even during their calamities.\n6 Though their judges are thrown down from the cliff,\nThe people will pay attention to my words, for they are pleasant.\n7 Just as when someone plows and breaks up the soil,\nSo our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the Grave.\n8 But my eyes look to you, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah.\nIn you I have taken refuge.\nDo not take away my life.\n9 Protect me from the jaws of the trap they have laid for me,\nFrom the snares of evildoers.\n10 The wicked will fall into their own nets all together\nWhile I pass by safely.\nPsalm 142\nMaskil. Of David when he was in the cave. A prayer.\n1 With my voice I call to Jehovah for help;\nWith my voice I plead with Jehovah for favor.\n2 Before him I pour out my concern;\nBefore him I tell about my distress\n3 When my spirit fails within me.\nThen you watch my roadway.\nIn the path where I walk,\nThey hide a trap for me.\n4 Look at my right hand and see\nThat no one cares about me.\nThere is nowhere I can flee;\nNo one is concerned about me.\n5 I call to you, O Jehovah, for help.\nI say: \"You are my refuge,\nAll I have in the land of the living.\"\n6 Pay attention to my cry for help,\nFor I have been brought very low.\nRescue me from my persecutors,\nFor they are stronger than I am.\n7 Bring me out of the dungeon\nTo praise your name.\nMay the righteous gather around me\nBecause you deal kindly with me.\nPsalm 143\nA melody of David.\n1 O Jehovah, hear my prayer;\nListen to my plea for help.\nIn your faithfulness and in your righteousness, answer me.\n2 Do not enter into judgment with your servant,\nFor no one living can be righteous before you.\n3 For the enemy pursues me;\nHe has crushed my life into the ground.\nHe has caused me to dwell in darkness like those long dead.\n4 My spirit is failing;\nMy heart is numb within me.\n5 I remember the days of old;\nI meditate on all your activity;\nI eagerly ponder over the work of your hands.\n6 I spread out my hands to you;\nI am like a parched land that thirsts for you. (Selah)\n7 Do answer me quickly, O Jehovah;\nMy strength has come to an end.\nDo not hide your face from me,\nOr I will be like those going down into the pit.\n8 Let me hear your loyal love in the morning,\nFor I trust in you.\nMake known to me the way I should walk,\nFor to you I turn.\n9 Rescue me from my enemies, O Jehovah.\nI seek your protection.\n10 Teach me to do your will,\nFor you are my God.\nYour spirit is good;\nMay it lead me on level ground.\n11 For the sake of your name, O Jehovah, preserve me alive.\nIn your righteousness, rescue me from distress.\n12 In your loyal love, put an end to my enemies;\nDestroy all those harassing me,\nFor I am your servant.\nPsalm 144\nOf David.\n1 May Jehovah, my Rock, be praised,\nWho trains my hands for battle,\nMy fingers for warfare.\n2 He is my loyal love and my stronghold,\nMy secure refuge and my rescuer,\nMy shield and the One in whom I have taken shelter,\nThe One subduing peoples under me.\n3 O Jehovah, what is man that you should notice him,\nThe son of mortal man that you should pay attention to him?\n4 Man resembles a mere breath;\nHis days are like a passing shadow.\n5 O Jehovah, lower your heavens and descend;\nTouch the mountains and make them smoke.\n6 Make lightning flash and scatter the enemy;\nShoot your arrows and throw them into confusion.\n7 Stretch out your hands from above;\nRescue me and save me from the surging waters,\nFrom the hand of the foreigners,\n8 Whose mouths speak lies\nAnd who raise their right hand to swear to what is false.\n9 O God, I will sing to you a new song.\nI will sing praises to you, accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument,\n10 To the One who gives victory to kings,\nThe One rescuing his servant David from the deadly sword.\n11 Rescue me and save me from the hand of the foreigners,\nWhose mouths speak lies\nAnd who raise their right hand to swear to what is false.\n12 Then our sons will be like young plants that grow up quickly,\nOur daughters like corner pillars carved for a palace.\n13 Our storehouses will overflow with every kind of produce;\nOur flocks in our fields will multiply by the thousands, by the tens of thousands.\n14 Our cattle, heavy with young, will suffer no mishap or miscarriage;\nThere will be no cry of distress in our public squares.\n15 Happy is the people for whom it is this way!\nHappy is the people whose God is Jehovah!\nPsalm 145\nA praise of David.\n?

    "text": "Proverbs\nChapter 1\n1 The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel:\n2 To learn wisdom and discipline;\nTo understand wise sayings;\n3 To acquire the discipline that gives insight,\nRighteousness, good judgment, and uprightness;\n4 To impart shrewdness to the inexperienced;\nTo give a young man knowledge and thinking ability.\n5 A wise person listens and takes in more instruction;\nA man of understanding acquires skillful direction\n6 To understand a proverb and a puzzling saying,\nThe words of the wise and their riddles.\n7 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge.\nOnly fools despise wisdom and discipline.\n8 Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father,\nAnd do not forsake the instruction of your mother.\n9 They are an attractive wreath for your head\nAnd a fine ornament for your neck.\n10 My son, if sinners try to entice you, do not consent.\n11 If they say: \"Come with us.\nLet us set an ambush to shed blood.\nWe will lie hidden, waiting for innocent victims without cause.\n12 We will swallow them alive as the Grave does,\nWhole, like those going down to the pit.\n13 Let us seize all their precious treasures;\nWe will fill our houses with spoil.\n14 You should join us,\nAnd we will all share equally what we steal.\"\n15 My son, do not follow them.\nKeep your feet off their path,\n16 For their feet run to do evil;\nThey hurry to shed blood.\n17 It is surely in vain to spread a net in full sight of a bird.\n18 That is why these lie in ambush to shed blood;\nThey lie hidden to take the lives of others.\n19 These are the ways of those seeking dishonest profit,\nWhich will take away the life of those who obtain it.\n20 True wisdom cries aloud in the street.\nIt keeps raising its voice in the public squares.\n21 At the corner of the busy streets it calls out.\nAt the entrances of the city gates it says:\n22 \"How long will you inexperienced ones love inexperience?\nHow long will you ridiculers take pleasure in ridicule?\nAnd how long will you foolish ones hate knowledge?\n23 Respond to my reproof.\nThen I will pour out my spirit for you;\nI will make my words known to you.\n24 Because I called out, but you kept refusing,\nI stretched out my hand, but no one was paying attention,\n25 You kept neglecting all my advice\nAnd rejecting my reproof,\n26 I also will laugh when disaster strikes you;\nI will mock when what you dread comes,\n27 When what you dread comes like a storm,\nAnd your disaster arrives like a storm wind,\nWhen distress and trouble come upon you.\n28 At that time they will keep calling me, but I will not answer;\nThey will eagerly look for me, but they will not find me,\n29 Because they hated knowledge,\nAnd they did not choose to fear Jehovah.\n30 They refused my advice;\nThey disrespected all my reproof.\n31 So they will bear the consequences of their way,\nAnd they will be glutted with their own counsel.\n32 For the waywardness of the inexperienced will kill them,\nAnd the complacency of fools will destroy them.\n33 But the one listening to me will dwell in security\nAnd be undisturbed by the dread of calamity.\"\nChapter 2\n1 My son, if you accept my sayings\nAnd treasure up my commandments,\n2 By making your ear attentive to wisdom\nAnd inclining your heart to discernment;\n3 Moreover, if you call out for understanding\nAnd raise your voice for discernment;\n4 If you keep seeking for it as for silver,\nAnd you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures;\n5 Then you will understand the fear of Jehovah,\nAnd you will find the knowledge of God.\n6 For Jehovah himself gives wisdom;\nFrom his mouth come knowledge and discernment.\n7 He treasures up practical wisdom for the upright;\nHe is a shield for those walking in integrity.\n8 He watches over the paths of justice,\nAnd he will guard the way of his loyal ones.\n9 Then you will understand what is righteous and just and fair,\nThe entire course of what is good.\n10 When wisdom enters your heart\nAnd knowledge becomes pleasant to your soul,\n11 Thinking ability will keep watch over you,\nAnd discernment will safeguard you,\n12 To save you from the bad course,\nFrom the man speaking perverse things,\n13 From those leaving the upright paths\nTo walk in the ways of darkness,\n14 From those who rejoice in wrongdoing,\nWho find joy in the perverseness of evil,\n15 Those whose paths are crooked\nAnd whose entire course is devious.\n16 It will save you from the wayward woman,\nFrom the smooth words of the immoral woman,\n17 Who abandons the close companion of her youth\nAnd forgets the covenant of her God;\n18 For her house sinks down into death,\nAnd her paths lead to those powerless in death.\n19 None of those having relations with her will return,\nNor will they regain the pathways of life.\n20 So follow the way of good people\nAnd stay on the paths of the righteous,\n21 For only the upright will reside in the earth,\nAnd the blameless will remain in it.\n22 As for the wicked, they will be cut off from the earth,\nAnd the treacherous will be torn away from it.\nChapter 3\n1 My son, do not forget my teaching,\nAnd may your heart observe my commandments,\n2 Because they will add many days\nAnd years of life and peace to you.\n3 Do not let loyal love and faithfulness leave you.\nTie them around your neck;\nWrite them on the tablet of your heart;\n4 Then you will find favor and good insight\nIn the eyes of God and man.\n5 Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,\nAnd do not rely on your own understanding.\n6 In all your ways take notice of him,\nAnd he will make your paths straight.\n7 Do not become wise in your own eyes.\nFear Jehovah and turn away from bad.\n8 It will be a healing to your body\nAnd refreshment for your bones.\n9 Honor Jehovah with your valuable things,\nWith the firstfruits of all your produce;\n10 Then your storehouses will be completely filled,\nAnd your vats will overflow with new wine.\n11 My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah,\nAnd do not loathe his reproof,\n12 For those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,\nJust as a father does a son in whom he delights.\n13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom\nAnd the man who acquires discernment;\n14 To gain it is better than gaining silver,\nAnd having it as profit is better than having gold.\n15 It is more precious than corals;\nNothing you desire can compare to it.\n16 Long life is in its right hand;\nRiches and glory are in its left hand.\n17 Its ways are pleasant,\nAnd all its paths are peaceful.\n18 It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it,\nAnd those who keep firm hold of it will be called happy.\n19 Jehovah founded the earth in wisdom.\nHe solidly established the heavens in discernment.\n20 By his knowledge the watery deeps were split apart\nAnd the cloudy skies dripped with dew.\n21 My son, do not lose sight of them.\nSafeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability;\n22 They will give you life\nAnd be an adornment for your neck;\n23 Then you will walk on your way in safety,\nAnd your foot will never stumble.\n24 When you lie down, you will have no fear;\nYou will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.\n25 You will not fear any sudden terror\nNor the storm that is coming on the wicked.\n26 For Jehovah will prove to be your source of confidence;\nHe will keep your foot from being caught.\n27 Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it\nIf it is within your power to help.\n28 Do not say to your neighbor, \"Go away; come back later! I will give it to you tomorrow,\"\nIf you can give it now.\n29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor\nWhen he lives in a sense of security with you.\n30 Do not quarrel with a man for no reason\nIf he has done nothing bad to you.\n31 Do not envy the violent man\nNor choose any of his ways,\n32 For Jehovah detests a devious person,\nBut His close friendship is with the upright.\n33 The curse of Jehovah is on the house of the wicked one,\nBut he blesses the home of the righteous.\n34 For he mocks those who ridicule,\nBut he shows favor to the meek.\n35 The wise will inherit honor,\nBut the stupid ones glorify dishonor.\nChapter 4\n1 Listen, my sons, to the discipline of a father;\nPay attention in order to gain understanding,\n2 For I will give you good instruction;\nDo not forsake my teaching.\n3 I was a true son to my father\nAnd the one especially loved by my mother.\n4 He taught me and said: \"May your heart hold fast to my words.\nKeep my commandments and continue living.\n5 Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding.\nDo not forget, and do not turn aside from what I say.\n6 Do not forsake it, and it will protect you.\nLove it, and it will safeguard you.\n7 Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom,\nAnd with all you acquire, acquire understanding.\n8 Highly esteem it, and it will exalt you.\nIt will honor you because you embrace it.\n9 It will place an attractive wreath on your head;\nIt will adorn you with a crown of beauty.\"\n10 Listen, my son, and accept my sayings,\nAnd the years of your life will be many.\n11 I will instruct you in the way of wisdom;\nI will lead you in the tracks of uprightness.\n12 When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;\nAnd if you run, you will not stumble.\n13 Hold on to discipline; do not let it go.\nSafeguard it, for it means your life.\n14 Do not enter the path of the wicked,\nAnd do not walk in the way of evil men.\n15 Shun it, do not take it;\nTurn away from it, and pass it by.\n16 For they cannot sleep unless they do what is bad.\nThey are robbed of sleep unless they cause someone's downfall.\n17 They feed themselves with the bread of wickedness,\nAnd they drink the wine of violence.\n18 But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light\nThat grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.\n19 The way of the wicked is like the darkness;\nThey do not know what makes them stumble.\n20 My son, pay attention to my words;\nListen carefully to my sayings.\n21 Do not lose sight of them;\nKeep them deep within your heart,\n22 For they are life to those who find them\nAnd health to their whole body.\n23 Above all the things that you guard, safeguard your heart,\nFor out of it are the sources of life.\n24 Put crooked speech away from you,\nAnd keep devious talk far away from you.\n25 Your eyes should look straight ahead,\nYes, fix your gaze straight ahead of you.\n26 Smooth out the course of your feet,\nAnd all your ways will be sure.\n27 Do not incline to the right or the left.\nTurn your feet away from what is bad.\nChapter 5\n1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom.\nListen carefully to my discernment,\n2 So that you may guard your thinking abilities\nAnd safeguard knowledge with your lips.\n3 For the lips of a wayward woman drip like a honeycomb,\nAnd her mouth is smoother than oil.\n4 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood\nAnd as sharp as a two-edged sword.\n5 Her feet descend into death.\nHer steps lead straight to the Grave.\n6 She gives no thought to the path of life.\nHer course wanders, but she does not know where.\n7 Now, my sons, listen to me\nAnd do not turn away from what I am saying.\n8 Stay far away from her;\nDo not go near the entrance of her house,\n9 So that you may not give your dignity to others\nNor reap years of what is cruel;\n10 So that strangers may not drain your resources\nAnd what you labored for go to the house of a foreigner.\n11 Otherwise, you will groan at the end of your life\nWhen your flesh and body waste away\n12 And you say: \"How I hated discipline!\nHow my heart despised reproof!\n13 I did not listen to the voice of my instructors\nOr pay attention to my teachers.\n14 I have come to the brink of complete ruin\nIn the midst of the entire congregation.\"\n15 Drink water from your own cistern\nAnd flowing water from your own well.\n16 Should your springs be dispersed outside,\nYour streams of water in the public squares?\n17 Let them be for you alone,\nAnd not for strangers with you.\n18 May your own fountain be blessed,\nAnd may you rejoice with the wife of your youth,\n19 A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat.\nLet her breasts satisfy you at all times.\nMay you be captivated by her love constantly.\n20 So why, my son, should you be captivated by a wayward woman\nOr embrace the bosom of an immoral woman?\n21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah;\nHe examines all his paths.\n22 The wicked one is ensnared by his own errors,\nAnd he will be caught in the ropes of his own sin.\n23 He will die for lack of discipline\nAnd go astray because of his excessive foolishness.\nChapter 6\n1 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,\nIf you have given your handshake to a stranger,\n2 If you have been ensnared by your promise,\nCaught by the words of your mouth,\n3 Do this, my son, and free yourself,\nFor you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor:\nGo and humble yourself and urgently plead with your neighbor.\n4 Do not allow your eyes to sleep,\nNor your eyelids to slumber.\n5 Free yourself like a gazelle from the hunter's hand,\nLike a bird from the hand of the birdcatcher.\n6 Go to the ant, you lazy one;\nObserve its ways and become wise.\n7 Although it has no commander, officer, or ruler,\n8 It prepares its food in the summer,\nAnd it gathers its food supplies in the harvest.\n9 How long, you lazy one, will you lie there?\nWhen will you rise up from your sleep?\n10 A little sleep, a little slumbering,\nA little folding of the hands to rest,\n11 And your poverty will come like a bandit,\nAnd your want like an armed man.\n12 A useless and wicked man walks about with crooked speech;\n13 He winks with his eye, signals with his foot, and motions with his fingers.\n14 With a perverted heart,\nHe is always scheming evil and spreading contentions.\n15 Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;\nIn a moment he will be broken beyond healing.\n16 There are six things that Jehovah hates;\nYes, seven things that he detests:\n17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,\n18 A heart plotting wicked schemes, and feet that run quickly to evil,\n19 A false witness who lies with every breath,\nAnd anyone sowing contentions among brothers.\n20 Observe, my son, the commandment of your father,\nAnd do not forsake the instruction of your mother.\n21 Always bind them around your heart;\nTie them about your neck.\n22 When you walk about, it will lead you;\nWhen you lie down, it will stand guard over you;\nAnd when you awaken, it will speak to you.\n23 For the commandment is a lamp,\nAnd the law is a light,\nAnd the reproofs of discipline are the way to life.\n24 They will guard you against the bad woman,\nAgainst the seductive tongue of the immoral woman.\n25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart\nOr allow her to captivate you with her alluring eyes,\n26 For because of a prostitute, a man is reduced to a loaf of bread,\nBut the wife of another man preys on a precious life.\n27 Can a man rake fire to his chest and not burn his garments?\n28 Or can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?\n29 It is the same with anyone having relations with his neighbor's wife;\nNo one who touches her will go unpunished.\n30 People do not despise a thief\nIf he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.\n31 Yet, when found, he will repay sevenfold;\nHe will give up all the valuables of his house.\n32 Anyone committing adultery with a woman is lacking good sense;\nThe one who does so brings ruin on himself.\n33 He will get only wounds and dishonor,\nAnd his disgrace will not be wiped away.\n34 For jealousy makes a husband furious;\nHe will show no compassion when he takes revenge.\n35 He will accept no compensation;\nHe will not be appeased, no matter how large you make the gift.\nChapter 7\n1 My son, keep my sayings,\nAnd treasure up my commandments.\n2 Keep my commandments and live;\nGuard my instruction like the pupil of your eye.\n3 Tie them around your fingers;\nWrite them on the tablet of your heart.\n4 Say to wisdom, \"You are my sister,\"\nAnd call understanding \"my relative,\"\n5 To guard you against the wayward woman,\nAgainst the immoral woman and her smooth words.\n6 From the window of my house,\nThrough my lattice, I looked down,\n7 And as I observed the naive ones,\nI discerned among the youths a young man lacking good sense.\n8 He passed along the street near her corner,\nAnd he marched in the direction of her house\n9 In the twilight, in the evening,\nAt the approach of night and darkness.\n10 Then I saw a woman meet him,\nDressed like a prostitute, with a cunning heart.\n11 She is loud and defiant.\nShe never stays at home.\n12 One moment she is outside, next she is in the public squares,\nShe lurks near every corner.\n13 She grabs hold of him and gives him a kiss;\nWith a bold face, she says to him:\n14 \"I had to offer communion sacrifices.\nToday I paid my vows.\n15 That is why I came out to meet you,\nTo look for you, and I found you!\n16 I have spread fine covers upon my bed,\nColorful linen from Egypt.\n17 I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.\n18 Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning;\nLet us enjoy passionate love together,\n19 For my husband is not at home;\nHe has gone on a distant journey.\n20 He took a bag of money with him,\nAnd he will not return until the day of the full moon.\"\n21 She misleads him with great persuasiveness.\nShe seduces him with smooth speech.\n22 Suddenly he goes after her, like a bull to the slaughter,\nLike a fool to be punished in the stocks,\n23 Until an arrow pierces his liver;\nLike a bird rushing into a trap, he does not know that it will cost him his life.\n24 And now, my sons, listen to me;\nPay attention to the words I speak.\n25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways.\nDo not stray onto her paths,\n26 For she has caused many to fall down slain,\nAnd those she has killed are numerous.\n27 Her house leads to the Grave;\nIt goes down to the inner chambers of death.\nChapter 8\n1 Is not wisdom calling out?\nIs not discernment raising its voice?\n2 On the heights along the road,\nIt takes its position at the crossroads.\n3 Next to the gates leading into the city,\nAt the entrances of the doorways,\nIt keeps crying out loudly:\n4 \"To you, O people, I am calling;\nI raise my voice to everyone.\n5 You inexperienced ones, learn shrewdness;\nYou stupid ones, acquire an understanding heart.\n6 Listen, for what I say is important,\nMy lips speak what is right;\n7 For my mouth softly utters truth,\nAnd my lips detest what is wicked.\n8 All the sayings of my mouth are righteous.\nNone of them are twisted or crooked.\n9 They are all straightforward to the discerning\nAnd right to those who have found knowledge.\n10 Take my discipline instead of silver,\nAnd knowledge rather than the finest gold,\n11 For wisdom is better than corals;\nAll other desirable things cannot compare to it.\n12 I, wisdom, dwell together with shrewdness;\nI have found knowledge and thinking ability.\n13 The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.\nI hate self-exaltation and pride and the evil way and perverse speech.\n14 I possess good advice and practical wisdom;\nUnderstanding and power are mine.\n15 By me kings keep reigning,\nAnd high officials decree righteousness.\n16 By me princes keep ruling,\nAnd nobles judge in righteousness.\n17 I love those loving me,\nAnd those seeking me will find me.\n18 Riches and glory are with me,\nLasting wealth and righteousness.\n19 My fruitage is better than gold, even refined gold,\nAnd what I produce is better than the finest silver.\n20 I walk in the path of righteousness,\nIn the middle of the pathways of justice;\n21 I give a rich inheritance to those who love me,\nAnd I fill up their storehouses.\n22 Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way,\nThe earliest of his achievements of long ago.\n23 From ancient times I was installed,\nFrom the start, from times earlier than the earth.\n24 When there were no deep waters, I was brought forth,\nWhen there were no springs overflowing with water.\n25 Before the mountains were set in place,\nBefore the hills, I was brought forth,\n26 When he had not yet made the earth and its fields\nOr the first clods of earth's soil.\n27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there;\nWhen he marked out the horizon on the surface of the waters,\n28 When he established the clouds above,\nWhen he founded the fountains of the deep,\n29 When he set a decree for the sea\nThat its waters should not pass beyond his order,\nWhen he established the foundations of the earth,\n30 Then I was beside him as a master worker.\nI was the one he was especially fond of day by day;\nI rejoiced before him all the time;\n31 I rejoiced over his habitable earth,\nAnd I was especially fond of the sons of men.\n32 And now, my sons, listen to me;\nYes, happy are those who keep my ways.\n33 Listen to discipline and become wise,\nAnd never neglect it.\n34 Happy is the man who listens to me\nBy coming early to my doors day by day,\nBy waiting next to my doorposts;\n35 For the one finding me will find life,\nAnd he receives approval from Jehovah.\n36 But the one who ignores me harms himself,\nAnd those who hate me love death.\"\nChapter 9\n1 True wisdom has built its house;\nIt has carved out its seven pillars.\n2 It has fully prepared its meat;\nIt has mixed its wine;\nIt has also arranged its table.\n3 It has sent out its female servants\nTo call out from the heights above the city:\n4 \"Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.\"\nShe says to the one lacking good sense:\n5 \"Come, eat my bread\nAnd share in drinking the wine that I have mixed.\n6 Leave behind your inexperience and live;\nWalk forward in the way of understanding.\"\n7 The one who corrects a ridiculer invites dishonor,\nAnd whoever reproves someone wicked will get hurt.\n8 Do not reprove a ridiculer, or he will hate you.\nReprove a wise person, and he will love you.\n9 Share with a wise person, and he will become wiser.\nTeach someone righteous, and he will add to his learning.\n10 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom,\nAnd knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.\n11 For by me your days will be many,\nAnd years will be added to your life.\n12 If you become wise, you are wise to your own advantage,\nBut if you are a ridiculer, you alone will bear it.\n13 A stupid woman is loud.\nShe is ignorant and knows absolutely nothing.\n14 She sits at the entrance of her house\nOn a seat in the high places of the city,\n15 Calling out to those passing by,\nTo those walking straight ahead on their way:\n16 \"Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.\"\nShe says to those lacking good sense:\n17 \"Stolen waters are sweet,\nAnd food eaten in secret is pleasant.\"\n18 But he does not know that those powerless in death are there,\nThat her guests are in the depths of the Grave.\nChapter 10\n1 Proverbs of Solomon.\nA wise son makes his father rejoice,\nBut a foolish son is the grief of his mother.\n2 The treasures gained by wickedness will be of no benefit,\nBut righteousness is what rescues from death.\n3 Jehovah will not cause the righteous one to go hungry,\nBut he will deny the wicked what they crave.\n4 Idle hands will cause poverty,\nBut diligent hands bring riches.\n5 The son acting with insight gathers the crop in summer,\nBut the son acting shamefully is fast asleep during the harvest.\n6 Blessings are on the head of the righteous one,\nBut the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.\n7 The memory of the righteous one is due for a blessing,\nBut the name of the wicked will rot.\n8 The wisehearted person will accept instructions,\nBut the one speaking foolishly will be trodden down.\n9 The one walking in integrity will walk in security,\nBut the one making his ways crooked will be found out.\n10 The one who slyly winks his eye causes grief,\nAnd the one who speaks foolishly will be trodden down.\n11 The mouth of the righteous one is a source of life,\nBut the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.\n12 Hatred is what stirs up contentions,\nBut love covers over all transgressions.\n13 Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning person,\nBut the rod is for the back of one lacking good sense.\n14 Those who are wise treasure up knowledge,\nBut the mouth of the fool invites ruin.\n15 The wealth of a rich man is his fortified city.\nThe ruin of the poor is their poverty.\n16 The activity of the righteous one leads to life;\nBut the produce of the wicked one leads to sin.\n17 The one who heeds discipline is a path to life,\nBut the one who ignores reproof leads others astray.\n18 The one who conceals his hatred speaks lies,\nAnd the one spreading malicious reports is stupid.\n19 When words are many, transgression cannot be avoided,\nBut whoever controls his lips acts discreetly.\n20 The tongue of the righteous one is like the finest silver,\nBut the heart of the wicked one is worth little.\n21 The lips of the righteous one nourish many,\nBut the foolish die for lack of sense.\n22 It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich,\nAnd He adds no pain with it.\n23 Engaging in shameful conduct is like a game to the stupid one,\nBut wisdom is for the man of discernment.\n24 What the wicked one fears will come upon him;\nBut the desire of the righteous will be granted.\n25 When the storm passes by, the wicked one will be no more,\nBut the righteous one is a foundation forever.\n26 Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,\nSo the lazy person is to the one who sends him.\n27 The fear of Jehovah prolongs life,\nBut the years of the wicked will be cut short.\n28 The expectation of the righteous brings joy,\nBut the hope of the wicked will perish.\n29 The way of Jehovah is a stronghold for the blameless one,\nBut it means ruin for evildoers.\n30 The righteous one will never be made to fall,\nBut the wicked will no longer inhabit the earth.\n31 The mouth of the righteous one produces wisdom,\nBut the perverse tongue will be cut off.\n32 The lips of the righteous one know what is pleasing,\nBut the mouth of the wicked is perverse.\nChapter 11\n1 Dishonest scales are detestable to Jehovah,\nBut an accurate weight brings pleasure to him.\n2 When presumptuousness comes, dishonor will follow,\nBut wisdom is with the modest ones.\n3 The integrity of the upright is what guides them,\nBut the deviousness of the treacherous will destroy them.\n4 Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,\nBut righteousness is what will rescue from death.\n5 The righteousness of the blameless one makes his path straight,\nBut the wicked one will fall because of his own wickedness.\n6 The righteousness of the upright will rescue them,\nBut the treacherous will be caught by their own desires.\n7 When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes;\nAnd expectations based on his power also perish.\n8 The righteous one is rescued from distress,\nAnd the wicked one takes his place.\n9 By his mouth the apostate brings his neighbor to ruin,\nBut by knowledge the righteous are rescued.\n10 The goodness of the righteous makes a city rejoice,\nAnd when the wicked perish, there is a joyful cry.\n11 Because of the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,\nBut the mouth of the wicked tears it down.\n12 Whoever is lacking good sense shows contempt for his neighbor,\nBut the man of true discernment remains silent.\n13 A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk,\nBut the trustworthy person keeps a confidence.\n14 When there is no skillful direction, the people fall,\nBut there is success through many advisers.\n15 Whoever guarantees a loan for a stranger is sure to fare badly,\nBut whoever avoids shaking hands in a pledge will be secure.\n16 A gracious woman acquires glory,\nBut ruthless men seize riches.\n17 A kind man benefits himself,\nBut the cruel person brings trouble on himself.\n18 The wicked one earns deceptive wages,\nBut the one who sows righteousness receives a true reward.\n19 The one standing firmly for righteousness is in line for life,\nBut the one chasing after evil is in line for death.\n20 Those crooked at heart are detestable to Jehovah,\nBut those whose way is blameless bring pleasure to him.\n21 Be assured of this: An evil person will not go unpunished,\nBut the children of the righteous will escape.\n22 Like a gold ring in the snout of a pig\nIs a beautiful woman who rejects good sense.\n23 The desire of the righteous leads to good,\nBut what the wicked hope for leads to fury.\n24 One gives generously and ends up with more;\nAnother withholds what should be given, but he comes to poverty.\n25 The generous person will prosper,\nAnd whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.\n26 The people will curse the one who withholds grain,\nBut they will bless the one who sells it.\n27 The one who diligently seeks to do good seeks favor,\nBut the one searching for bad-that is what will surely come upon him.\n28 The one trusting in his riches will fall,\nBut the righteous will flourish like the foliage.\n29 Anyone who brings trouble on his household will inherit the wind,\nAnd the fool will be a servant to the wisehearted one.\n30 The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life,\nAnd the one who wins souls is wise.\n31 If, indeed, the righteous one on earth is rewarded,\nHow much more the wicked one and the sinner!\nChapter 12\n1 The one who loves discipline loves knowledge,\nBut the one who hates reproof is unreasoning.\n2 The good person obtains Jehovah's approval,\nBut He condemns the man of wicked schemes.\n3 No man is made secure by wickedness,\nBut the righteous will never be uprooted.\n4 A capable wife is a crown to her husband,\nBut the wife who acts shamefully is like rottenness in his bones.\n5 The thoughts of the righteous are just,\nBut the guidance of the wicked is deceptive.\n6 The words of the wicked are a deadly ambush,\nBut the mouth of the upright saves them.\n7 When the wicked are overthrown, they are no more,\nBut the house of the righteous will keep standing.\n8 A man is praised for the discretion of his mouth,\nBut one with a twisted heart will be treated with contempt.\n9 Better to be lightly esteemed and have a servant\nThan to glorify oneself and have no food.\n10 The righteous one takes care of his domestic animals,\nBut even the mercy of the wicked is cruel.\n11 The one who cultivates his land will be satisfied with food,\nBut the one pursuing worthless things is lacking good sense.\n12 The wicked man envies what other evil men have caught,\nBut the root of the righteous bears fruit.\n13 The evil man is ensnared by his own sinful speech,\nBut the righteous one escapes from distress.\n14 From the fruitage of his speech a man is satisfied with good,\nAnd the work of his hands will reward him.\n15 The way of the fool is right in his own eyes,\nBut the wise one accepts advice.\n16 A fool immediately shows his annoyance,\nBut the shrewd man overlooks an insult.\n17 The one who testifies faithfully will tell the truth,\nBut a false witness speaks deceit.\n18 Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword,\nBut the tongue of the wise is a healing.\n19 Truthful lips will endure forever,\nBut a lying tongue will last for only a moment.\n20 Deceit is in the heart of those who plot mischief,\nBut those who promote peace have joy.\n21 No harm will befall the righteous one,\nBut the wicked will have their fill of calamity.\n22 Lying lips are detestable to Jehovah,\nBut those acting faithfully bring pleasure to him.\n23 A shrewd man conceals what he knows,\nBut the heart of the fool blurts out his foolishness.\n24 The hand of the diligent ones will rule,\nBut idle hands will be put to forced labor.\n25 Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down,\nBut a good word cheers it up.\n26 The righteous one searches out his pastures,\nBut the course of the wicked leads them astray.\n27 The lazy do not chase after the prey,\nBut diligence is a man's precious treasure.\n28 The path of righteousness leads to life;\nAlong its pathway there is no death.\nChapter 13\n1 A wise son accepts his father's discipline,\nBut the scoffer does not listen to a rebuke.\n2 From the fruitage of his speech a man will eat what is good,\nBut the very desire of the treacherous is for violence.\n3 The one guarding his mouth protects his life,\nBut the one opening his lips wide will come to ruin.\n4 The lazy person has his cravings, yet he has nothing,\nBut the diligent one will be fully satisfied.\n5 The righteous one hates lies,\nBut the actions of the wicked bring shame and disgrace.\n6 Righteousness protects the one whose way is innocent,\nBut wickedness brings down the sinner.\n7 There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;\nThere is another who pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.\n8 Riches are the ransom for a man's life,\nBut the poor are not even threatened.\n9 The light of the righteous shines brightly,\nBut the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.\n10 Presumptuousness leads only to strife,\nBut wisdom belongs to those who seek advice.\n11 Wealth quickly gained will dwindle,\nBut the wealth of the one who gathers it little by little will increase.\n12 Expectation postponed makes the heart sick,\nBut a desire realized is a tree of life.\n13 Whoever despises instruction will pay the penalty,\nBut the one who respects the commandment will be rewarded.\n14 The teaching of the wise one is a source of life\nTo turn one away from the snares of death.\n15 Keen insight wins favor,\nBut the way of the treacherous is harsh.\n16 The shrewd person acts with knowledge,\nBut the fool exposes his own foolishness.\n17 A wicked messenger falls into trouble,\nBut a faithful envoy brings healing.\n18 Whoever neglects discipline comes to poverty and disgrace,\nBut the one accepting correction will be glorified.\n19 Desire when realized is sweet to a person,\nBut the stupid hate to turn away from bad.\n20 The one walking with the wise will become wise,\nBut the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.\n21 Calamity pursues sinners,\nBut prosperity rewards the righteous.\n22 The good person leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren,\nBut the sinner's wealth will be stored up for the righteous one.\n23 The plowed field of the poor yields much food,\nBut it may be swept away by injustice.\n24 Whoever holds back his rod hates his son,\nBut the one who loves him disciplines him diligently.\n25 The righteous one eats and satisfies his appetite,\nBut the stomach of the wicked is empty.\nChapter 14\n1 The truly wise woman builds up her house,\nBut the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.\n2 The one walking in his uprightness fears Jehovah,\nBut the one whose ways are devious despises Him.\n3 The rod of haughtiness is in the mouth of the fool,\nBut the lips of the wise will protect them.\n4 Where there are no cattle the manger is clean,\nBut the power of a bull yields an abundant harvest.\n5 A faithful witness will not lie,\nBut a false witness lies with every breath.\n6 The scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none,\nBut knowledge comes easily to the person with understanding.\n7 Stay away from the foolish man,\nFor you will not find knowledge on his lips.\n8 By wisdom the shrewd man understands the way he is going,\nBut the stupid are deceived by their foolishness.\n9 Fools make fun of guilt,\nBut among the upright, there is a willingness to reconcile.\n10 The heart knows its own bitterness,\nAnd no outsider can share in its joy.\n11 The house of the wicked will be destroyed,\nBut the tent of the upright will flourish.\n12 There is a way that seems right to a man,\nBut in the end it leads to death.\n13 Even in laughter the heart may feel pain,\nAnd rejoicing may end in grief.\n14 The one wayward at heart will reap the results of his ways,\nBut the good man reaps the reward of his dealings.\n15 The naive person believes every word,\nBut the shrewd one ponders each step.\n16 The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil,\nBut the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.\n17 The one who is quick to anger acts foolishly,\nBut the man who thinks things out is hated.\n18 The naive will inherit foolishness,\nBut the shrewd are crowned with knowledge.\n19 Bad people will have to bow down before the good,\nAnd the wicked will bow at the gates of the righteous.\n20 The poor man is hated even by his neighbors,\nBut many are the friends of the rich person.\n21 The one who despises his neighbor sins,\nBut whoever shows compassion to the lowly is happy.\n22 Will not those who plot mischief go astray?\nBut those intent on doing good will receive loyal love and faithfulness.\n23 There is benefit in every kind of hard work,\nBut mere talk leads to want.\n24 The crown of the wise is their wealth;\nBut the foolishness of the stupid is only foolishness.\n25 A true witness saves lives,\nBut a deceitful one lies with every breath.\n26 There is strong confidence in the fear of Jehovah,\nAnd it will be a refuge for his children.\n27 The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life,\nTo turn one away from the snares of death.\n28 A multitude of people are a king's majesty,\nBut a ruler without subjects is ruined.\n29 The one who is slow to anger has great discernment,\nBut the impatient one displays his foolishness.\n30 A calm heart gives life to the body,\nBut jealousy is rottenness to the bones.\n31 The one who defrauds the lowly one insults his Maker,\nBut whoever shows compassion to the poor glorifies Him.\n32 The wicked one will be brought down by his own evil,\nBut the righteous one will find refuge in his integrity.\n33 Wisdom rests quietly in the heart of an understanding person,\nBut among the stupid it must make itself known.\n34 Righteousness exalts a nation,\nBut sin is disgraceful to a people.\n35 The king finds pleasure in a servant who acts with insight,\nBut his fury is against the one who acts shamefully.\nChapter 15\n1 A mild answer turns away rage,\nBut a harsh word stirs up anger.\n2 The tongue of the wise makes good use of knowledge,\nBut the mouth of the stupid blurts out foolishness.\n3 The eyes of Jehovah are everywhere,\nWatching both the bad and the good.\n4 A calm tongue is a tree of life,\nBut twisted speech causes despair.\n5 A fool disrespects his father's discipline,\nBut a shrewd person accepts correction.\n6 In the house of the righteous one there is abundant treasure,\nBut the produce of the wicked one brings him trouble.\n7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge,\nBut not so the heart of the stupid one.\n8 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to Jehovah,\nBut the prayer of the upright is a pleasure to Him.\n9 Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one,\nBut he loves the one who pursues righteousness.\n10 Discipline seems bad to one forsaking the way,\nBut whoever hates reproof will die.\n11 The Grave and the place of destruction are in full view of Jehovah.\nHow much more so the hearts of men!\n12 The scoffer does not love the one correcting him.\nHe will not consult the wise.\n13 A joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance,\nBut heartache crushes the spirit.\n14 The understanding heart seeks knowledge,\nBut the mouth of the stupid feeds on foolishness.\n15 All the days of the afflicted one are bad,\nBut the one with a cheerful heart has a continual feast.\n16 Better is a little in the fear of Jehovah\nThan great wealth along with anxiety.\n17 Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love\nThan a fattened bull where there is hatred.\n18 A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,\nBut one who is slow to anger calms a quarrel.\n19 The way of the lazy one is like a hedge of thorns,\nBut the path of the upright is like a level highway.\n20 A wise son makes his father rejoice,\nBut a stupid man despises his mother.\n21 Foolishness is a joy to one lacking good sense,\nBut the man of discernment walks straight ahead.\n22 Plans fail when there is no consultation,\nBut there is accomplishment through many advisers.\n23 A man rejoices in giving the right answer,\nAnd a word spoken at the right time-how good it is!\n24 The path of life leads upward to one with insight,\nTo turn him away from the Grave below.\n25 Jehovah will tear down the house of the haughty,\nBut he will preserve the boundary of the widow.\n26 Jehovah detests the schemes of the wicked one,\nBut pleasant sayings are pure to Him.\n27 The one making dishonest profit brings trouble on his own household,\nBut the one hating bribes will keep living.\n28 The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering,\nBut the mouth of the wicked blurts out bad things.\n29 Jehovah is far away from the wicked,\nBut he hears the prayer of the righteous.\n30 Bright eyes make the heart rejoice;\nA good report invigorates the bones.\n31 The one who listens to life-giving reproof\nIs at home among the wise.\n32 Anyone refusing discipline despises his life,\nBut whoever listens to reproof acquires understanding.\n33 The fear of Jehovah is a training in wisdom,\nAnd before glory there is humility.\nChapter 16\n1 A man prepares the thoughts of his heart,\nBut the answer he gives is from Jehovah.\n2 All of a man's ways seem right to him,\nBut Jehovah examines the motives.\n3 Commit to Jehovah whatever you do,\nAnd your plans will succeed.\n4 Jehovah has made everything work for his purpose,\nEven the wicked for the day of disaster.\n5 Everyone proud in heart is detestable to Jehovah.\nBe assured that he will not go unpunished.\n6 By loyal love and faithfulness, error is atoned for,\nAnd by fearing Jehovah one turns away from bad.\n7 When Jehovah is pleased with a man's ways,\nHe causes even his enemies to be at peace with him.\n8 Better is a little with righteousness\nThan a large income without justice.\n9 A man may plot out his course in his heart,\nBut it is Jehovah who directs his steps.\n10 Inspired decision should be on the lips of a king;\nHe must never betray justice.\n11 Honest balances and scales are from Jehovah;\nAll the weights in the bag are his doing.\n12 Wicked practices are detestable to kings,\nFor the throne is firmly established by righteousness.\n13 Righteous speech is a pleasure to kings.\nThey love someone who speaks honestly.\n14 The king's rage is like a messenger of death,\nBut the wise man appeases it.\n15 In the light of the king's face there is life;\nHis favor is like a cloud of rain in spring.\n16 How much better to acquire wisdom than gold!\nTo gain understanding is to be chosen over silver.\n17 The highway of the upright avoids what is bad.\nWhoever safeguards his way preserves his life.\n18 Pride is before a crash,\nAnd a haughty spirit before stumbling.\n19 Better to be humble among the meek\nThan to share the spoil of the haughty.\n20 The one who shows insight in a matter will find success,\nAnd happy is the one trusting in Jehovah.\n21 The wise in heart will be called understanding,\nAnd the one kind in speech adds persuasiveness.\n22 Insight is a fountain of life to those possessing it,\nBut fools are disciplined by their own foolishness.\n23 The heart of the wise one gives his mouth insight\nAnd adds persuasiveness to his speech.\n24 Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb,\nSweet to the soul and a healing to the bones.\n25 There is a way that seems right to a man,\nBut in the end it leads to death.\n26 The appetite of a laborer makes him work hard\nFor his hunger urges him on.\n27 A worthless man digs up what is bad;\nHis speech is like a scorching fire.\n28 A troublemaker causes dissension,\nAnd a slanderer separates close friends.\n29 A violent man entices his neighbor\nAnd leads him in the wrong way.\n30 He winks his eye as he schemes harm.\nHe pinches his lips together as he carries out mischief.\n31 Gray hair is a crown of beauty\nWhen it is found in the way of righteousness.\n32 The one slow to anger is better than a mighty man,\nAnd the one controlling his temper than one conquering a city.\n33 The lot is cast into the lap,\nBut every decision by it is from Jehovah.\nChapter 17\n1 Better is a piece of dry bread where there is peace\nThan a house full of feasting along with quarreling.\n2 A servant with insight will rule over a son who acts shamefully;\nHe will share in the inheritance as one of the brothers.\n3 The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,\nBut Jehovah is the examiner of hearts.\n4 A wicked man pays attention to hurtful speech,\nAnd a deceptive man listens to a malicious tongue.\n5 Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker,\nAnd whoever rejoices over another's disaster will not go unpunished.\n6 Grandsons are a crown to the aged,\nAnd fathers are the glory of their sons.\n7 Upright speech does not befit a fool.\nHow much less does false speech befit a ruler!\n8 A gift is like a precious stone to its owner;\nEverywhere he turns, it brings him success.\n9 Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love,\nBut the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.\n10 A rebuke makes a deeper impression on one having understanding\nThan striking a stupid person a hundred times.\n11 A bad man seeks only rebellion,\nBut a cruel messenger will be sent to punish him.\n12 Better to meet a bear bereaved of her cubs\nThan to encounter someone stupid in his foolishness.\n13 If anyone repays bad for good,\nBad will not depart from his house.\n14 Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate;\nBefore the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.\n15 Anyone who acquits the wicked one and anyone who condemns the righteous one\n-Both of them are detestable to Jehovah.\n16 What good is it that the stupid one has the means to acquire wisdom\nWhen he has no heart for acquiring it?\n17 A true friend shows love at all times\nAnd is a brother who is born for times of distress.\n18 A man lacking good sense shakes hands and agrees\nTo put up security in the presence of his neighbor.\n19 The one who loves conflict loves transgression.\nAnyone who makes his entryway high invites a crash.\n20 The one who is crooked at heart will not find success,\nAnd the one who speaks deceitfully will fall into ruin.\n21 The one who fathers a stupid child will experience grief;\nAnd the father of a senseless child has no joy.\n22 A joyful heart is good medicine,\nBut a crushed spirit saps one's strength.\n23 A wicked man will take a bribe in secret\nTo pervert the course of justice.\n24 Wisdom is directly in front of the discerning person,\nBut the eyes of the stupid wander to the ends of the earth.\n25 A stupid son brings grief to his father\nAnd heartache to the one who gave birth to him.\n26 To punish the righteous one is not good,\nAnd to flog honorable people goes against what is right.\n27 A man of knowledge restrains his words,\nAnd a discerning man will remain calm.\n28 Even a fool who keeps silent will be considered wise,\nAnd the one who seals his lips, discerning.\nChapter 18\n1 Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires;\nHe rejects all practical wisdom.\n2 A stupid person takes no pleasure in understanding;\nHe would rather disclose what is in his heart.\n3 When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes,\nAnd along with dishonor there is disgrace.\n4 The words of a man's mouth are deep waters.\nThe fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.\n5 It is not good to show partiality to the wicked one\nOr to deprive the righteous one of justice.\n6 The speech of the stupid one leads to quarrels,\nAnd his mouth invites a beating.\n7 The mouth of the stupid is his ruin,\nAnd his lips are a snare for his life.\n8 The words of a slanderer are like tasty morsels;\nThey are gulped right down into the stomach.\n9 Whoever is lazy in his work\nIs a brother to the one who causes ruin.\n10 The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.\nInto it the righteous one runs and receives protection.\n11 The wealth of the rich is his fortified city;\nIt is like a protective wall in his imagination.\n12 Before a crash a man's heart is lofty,\nAnd before glory there is humility.\n13 When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts,\nIt is foolish and humiliating.\n14 A person's spirit can sustain him through illness,\nBut who can bear a crushed spirit?\n15 The heart of the understanding one acquires knowledge,\nAnd the ear of the wise seeks to find knowledge.\n16 A man's gift opens the way for him;\nIt gives him access to great people.\n17 The first to state his case seems right,\nUntil the other party comes and cross-examines him.\n18 Casting lots puts an end to disputes\nAnd decides between strong opponents.\n19 A brother offended is more unyielding than a fortified city,\nAnd there are disputes like the bars of a fortress.\n20 From the fruitage of a man's speech his stomach will be filled;\nHe will be satisfied with what his lips produce.\n21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue;\nThose who love to use it will eat its fruitage.\n22 The one who finds a good wife has found something good,\nAnd he receives Jehovah's favor.\n23 The poor man implores when speaking,\nBut the rich man answers harshly.\n24 There are companions ready to crush one another,\nBut there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.\nChapter 19\n1 It is better to be poor and walk in integrity\nThan to be stupid and speak lies.\n2 A person without knowledge is not good,\nAnd the one who acts rashly is sinning.\n3 It is a man's own foolishness that distorts his way,\nAnd his heart becomes enraged against Jehovah.\n4 Wealth attracts many friends,\nBut the poor man will be deserted even by his friend.\n5 A false witness will not go unpunished,\nAnd the one who lies with every breath will not escape.\n6 Many seek the favor of a noble,\nAnd everyone is a friend to the man who gives gifts.\n7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him;\nHow much more he is shunned by his friends!\nHe pursues them with requests, but no one responds.\n8 Whoever acquires good sense loves himself.\nWhoever treasures discernment will find success.\n9 A false witness will not go unpunished,\nAnd the one who lies with every breath will perish.\n10 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury;\nHow much less for a servant to rule over princes!\n11 The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger,\nAnd it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.\n12 The king's rage is like the growling of a lion,\nBut his favor is like dew on the vegetation.\n13 A stupid son brings adversity on his father,\nAnd a quarrelsome wife is like a roof that never stops leaking.\n14 A house and wealth are inherited from fathers,\nBut a discreet wife is from Jehovah.\n15 Laziness brings on a deep sleep,\nAnd a sluggish person will go hungry.\n16 The one who keeps the commandment keeps his life;\nThe one who is reckless about his ways will die.\n17 The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah,\nAnd He will repay him for what he does.\n18 Discipline your son while there is hope,\nAnd do not become responsible for his death.\n19 The hot-tempered man will pay the penalty;\nIf you try to spare him, you will have to do it again and again.\n20 Listen to counsel and accept discipline,\nIn order to become wise in your future.\n21 Many are the plans in a man's heart,\nBut the counsel of Jehovah is what will prevail.\n22 The desirable thing in a man is his loyal love;\nAnd it is better to be poor than to be a liar.\n23 The fear of Jehovah leads to life;\nThe one who has it will have a pleasant rest, free from harm.\n24 The lazy one buries his hand in the banquet bowl,\nBut he does not even bother to bring it back to his mouth.\n25 Strike the ridiculer, so that the inexperienced one may become shrewd,\nAnd reprove the understanding one, so that he will increase in knowledge.\n26 The one who mistreats his father and drives away his mother\nIs a son causing shame and disgrace.\n27 My son, if you stop listening to discipline,\nYou will stray from the sayings of knowledge.\n28 A worthless witness mocks justice,\nAnd the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.\n29 Judgment is in store for ridiculers,\nAnd beatings for the back of the stupid ones.\nChapter 20\n1 Wine is a ridiculer, alcohol is unruly;\nWhoever goes astray by them is not wise.\n2 The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion;\nWhoever provokes his anger risks his own life.\n3 It is honorable for a man to refrain from a dispute,\nBut every fool will become embroiled in it.\n4 The lazy one does not plow in winter,\nSo he will be begging during the harvest when he has nothing.\n5 The thoughts of a man's heart are like deep waters,\nBut the discerning man draws them out.\n6 Many men proclaim their loyal love,\nBut who can find a faithful man?\n7 The righteous one is walking in his integrity.\nHappy are his children who come after him.\n8 When the king sits on the throne to judge,\nHe sifts out all evil with his eyes.\n9 Who can say: \"I have cleansed my heart;\nI am pure from my sin\"?\n10 Dishonest weights and false measures\n-Both are detestable to Jehovah.\n11 Even a child is known by his actions,\nWhether his behavior is pure and right.\n12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye\n-Jehovah has made both of them.\n13 Do not love sleep, or you will come to poverty.\nOpen your eyes, and you will be satisfied with bread.\n14 \"It is no good, it is no good!\" says the buyer;\nThen he goes away and boasts about himself.\n15 There is gold, also much coral,\nBut the lips of knowledge are something precious.\n16 Take a man's garment if he has given security for a stranger;\nSeize the pledge from him if he did so for a foreign woman.\n17 Bread gained by deceit tastes good to a man,\nBut afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.\n18 By consultation, plans will succeed,\nAnd by skillful direction wage your war.\n19 A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk;\nDo not associate with one who loves to gossip.\n20 Whoever curses his father and his mother,\nHis lamp will be extinguished when darkness comes.\n21 An inheritance obtained first by greed\nWill not be a blessing in the end.\n22 Do not say: \"I will pay back evil!\"\nHope in Jehovah, and he will save you.\n23 Dishonest weights are detestable to Jehovah,\nAnd deceptive scales are not good.\n24 A man's footsteps are directed by Jehovah;\nHow can a man understand his own way?\n25 It is a snare for a man to cry out rashly, \"Holy!\"\nAnd only later to give consideration to what he vowed.\n26 A wise king sifts out the wicked\nAnd drives the threshing wheel over them.\n27 The breath of a man is the lamp of Jehovah,\nSearching through his innermost being.\n28 Loyal love and faithfulness safeguard the king;\nBy loyal love he sustains his throne.\n29 The glory of young men is their strength,\nAnd the splendor of old men is their gray hair.\n30 Bruises and wounds purge away evil,\nAnd beatings cleanse one's innermost being.\nChapter 21\n1 A king's heart is like streams of water in Jehovah's hand.\nHe directs it wherever He pleases.\n2 All of a man's ways seem right to him,\nBut Jehovah examines the hearts.\n3 To do what is right and just\nIs more pleasing to Jehovah than a sacrifice.\n4 Haughty eyes and an arrogant heart\n-The lamp that guides the wicked is sin.\n5 The plans of the diligent surely lead to success,\nBut all who are hasty surely head for poverty.\n6 Gaining treasures by a lying tongue\nIs like a vanishing mist, a deadly snare.\n7 The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,\nFor they refuse to act with justice.\n8 The way of a guilty man is crooked,\nBut the activity of the pure man is upright.\n9 Better to dwell on a corner of the roof\nThan in the same house with a quarrelsome wife.\n10 The wicked man craves what is bad;\nHe shows no favor toward his neighbor.\n11 When a ridiculer is punished, the inexperienced become wiser,\nAnd when a wise person receives insight, he gains knowledge.\n12 The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked one;\nHe overthrows the wicked to their ruin.\n13 Whoever stops up his ear to the cry of the lowly one\nWill himself call and not be answered.\n14 A secret gift subdues anger,\nAnd a hidden bribe, fierce rage.\n15 It is a joy for the righteous one to act with justice,\nBut it is something terrible to those who practice evil.\n16 The man who strays from the way of insight\nWill rest in the company of those powerless in death.\n17 The one who loves having a good time will come to poverty;\nThe one who loves wine and oil will not grow rich.\n18 The wicked one is a ransom for the righteous one,\nAnd the treacherous one will be taken in place of the upright.\n19 Better to dwell in the wilderness\nThan with a quarrelsome and irritable wife.\n20 Precious treasure and oil are found in the house of the wise,\nBut the stupid man will squander what he has.\n21 Whoever pursues righteousness and loyal love\nWill find life, righteousness, and glory.\n22 A wise man can scale the city of the mighty\nAnd undermine the strength in which they trust.\n23 The one guarding his mouth and his tongue\nKeeps himself out of trouble.\n24 A presumptuous, arrogant braggart is what you call\nThe man who acts with reckless presumptuousness.\n25 What the lazy man craves will put him to death,\nFor his hands refuse to work.\n26 All day long he greedily craves,\nBut the righteous one gives, holding nothing back.\n27 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable.\nHow much more when he offers it with evil intent!\n28 A lying witness will perish,\nBut the man who listens will testify with success.\n29 The wicked man puts on a bold face,\nBut it is the upright one whose course is sure.\n30 There is no wisdom, nor discernment, nor counsel in opposition to Jehovah.\n31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle,\nBut salvation belongs to Jehovah.\nChapter 22\n1 A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth;\nTo be respected is better than silver and gold.\n2 The rich and the poor have this in common:\nJehovah made them both.\n3 The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,\nBut the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.\n4 The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah\nIs riches and glory and life.\n5 Thorns and traps are in the crooked man's path,\nBut whoever values his life keeps far away from them.\n6 Train a boy in the way he should go;\nEven when he grows old he will not depart from it.\n7 The rich one rules the poor,\nAnd the borrower is a slave to the lender.\n8 Whoever sows unrighteousness will reap disaster,\nAnd the rod of his fury will come to its end.\n9 The generous person will be blessed,\nFor he shares his food with the poor.\n10 Drive away the scornful man,\nAnd contention will disappear;\nDisputes and insults will cease.\n11 The one who loves a pure heart and whose speech is gracious\nWill have the king as his friend.\n12 The eyes of Jehovah safeguard knowledge,\nBut He overturns the words of the treacherous.\n13 The lazy one says: \"There is a lion outside!\nI will be killed in the middle of the public square!\"\n14 The mouth of wayward women is a deep pit.\nThe one condemned by Jehovah will fall into it.\n15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a boy,\nBut the rod of discipline will remove it far from him.\n16 The one defrauding the poor to increase his wealth\nAnd the one giving gifts to the rich\nWill end up in poverty.\n17 Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise,\nIn order to apply your heart to my knowledge,\n18 For it is pleasant to keep them deep within you,\nSo that all of them may constantly be on your lips.\n19 For your confidence to be in Jehovah,\nI am giving you knowledge today.\n20 Have I not already written you,\nImparting advice and knowledge,\n21 To teach you true and reliable words,\nSo that you can return with an accurate report to the one who sent you?\n22 Do not rob the poor man because he is poor,\nAnd do not crush the lowly man in the city gate,\n23 For Jehovah himself will plead their cause\nAnd he will take the life of those who defraud them.\n24 Do not keep company with a hot-tempered man\nOr get involved with one disposed to rage,\n25 So that you never learn his ways\nAnd ensnare yourself.\n26 Do not be among those who shake hands in a pledge,\nWho put up security for loans.\n27 If you have nothing to pay,\nYour bed will be taken right out from under you!\n28 Do not move an ancient boundary marker\nThat your forefathers put in place.\n29 Have you seen a man skillful at his work?\nHe will stand before kings;\nHe will not stand before common men.\nChapter 23\n1 When you sit down to eat with a king,\nCarefully consider what is before you;\n2 Put a knife to your throat\nIf you have a large appetite.\n3 Do not crave his delicacies,\nFor it is deceptive food.\n4 Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.\nStop and show understanding.\n5 When you cast your eyes on it, it is not there,\nFor it will surely sprout wings like an eagle and fly off into the sky.\n6 Do not eat the food of a stingy person;\nDo not crave his delicacies,\n7 For he is like one keeping accounts.\n\"Eat and drink,\" he says to you, but he does not mean it.\n8 You will vomit up the morsels you have eaten\nAnd will have wasted your compliments.\n9 Do not speak in the ears of the stupid one,\nFor he will despise the wisdom of your words.\n10 Do not move an ancient boundary marker\nOr encroach on the field of the fatherless.\n11 For their Defender is strong;\nHe will take up their cause against you.\n12 Apply your heart to discipline\nAnd your ear to the sayings of knowledge.\n13 Do not hold back discipline from a boy.\nIf you strike him with the rod, he will not die.\n14 With the rod you should strike him,\nIn order to save him from the Grave.\n15 My son, if your heart becomes wise,\nThen my own heart will rejoice.\n16 My innermost being will find joy\nWhen your lips speak what is right.\n17 Let your heart not envy sinners,\nBut be in the fear of Jehovah all day long,\n18 For then you will have a future\nAnd your hope will not be cut off.\n19 Listen, my son, and become wise,\nAnd direct your heart in the right way.\n20 Do not be among those who drink too much wine,\nAmong those who gorge themselves on meat,\n21 For a drunkard and a glutton will come to poverty,\nAnd drowsiness will clothe one with rags.\n22 Listen to your father who caused your birth,\nAnd do not despise your mother just because she has grown old.\n23 Buy truth and never sell it,\nAlso wisdom and discipline and understanding.\n24 The father of a righteous one will surely be joyful;\nWhoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him.\n25 Your father and your mother will rejoice,\nAnd she who gave birth to you will be joyful.\n26 My son, do give your heart to me,\nAnd may your eyes take pleasure in my ways.\n27 For a prostitute is a deep pit,\nAnd an immoral woman is a narrow well.\n28 She lies in wait like a robber;\nShe increases the number of unfaithful men.\n29 Who has woe? Who has uneasiness?\nWho has quarrels? Who has complaints?\nWho has wounds for no reason? Who has bleary eyes?\n30 Those lingering long over wine;\nThose searching out mixed wine.\n31 Do not look at the wine's red color\nAs it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly,\n32 For in the end it bites like a serpent,\nAnd it secretes poison like a viper.\n33 Your eyes will see strange things,\nAnd your heart will speak perverse things.\n34 And you will be like one lying down in the middle of the sea,\nLike one lying at the top of a ship's mast.\n35 You will say: \"They have struck me, but I did not feel it.\nThey beat me, but I did not know it.\nWhen will I wake up?\nI need another drink.\"\nChapter 24\n1 Do not envy evil men,\nAnd do not crave their company,\n2 For their heart meditates on violence,\nAnd their lips speak of trouble.\n3 By wisdom a house is built up,\nAnd by discernment it is made secure.\n4 By knowledge its rooms are filled\nWith all sorts of precious and pleasant treasures.\n5 A wise man is powerful,\nAnd with knowledge a man increases his power.\n6 By skillful direction you will wage your war,\nAnd through many advisers there is victory.\n7 True wisdom is unattainable for a fool;\nHe has nothing to say in the city gate.\n8 Anyone who plots evil\nWill be called a master schemer.\n9 Foolish schemes are sinful,\nAnd people detest a ridiculer.\n10 If you become discouraged in the day of distress,\nYour strength will be meager.\n11 Rescue those who are being taken away to death,\nAnd hold back those staggering to the slaughter.\n12 If you say, \"But we did not know about this,\"\nDoes not the One who examines hearts discern it?\nYes, the One who watches you will know\nAnd will repay each man according to his activity.\n13 My son, eat honey, because it is good;\nHoney from the comb is sweet to the taste.\n14 Likewise, know that wisdom is good for you.\nIf you find it, you will have a future\nAnd your hope will not be cut off.\n15 Do not wickedly lie in ambush near the home of the righteous one;\nDo not destroy his place of rest.\n16 For the righteous one may fall seven times, and he will get up again,\nBut the wicked will be made to stumble by calamity.\n17 When your enemy falls, do not rejoice,\nAnd when he stumbles, do not let your heart be joyful;\n18 Otherwise, Jehovah will see and be displeased,\nAnd He will turn away his anger from him.\n19 Do not be upset because of evil men;\nDo not envy wicked people,\n20 For there is no future for anyone evil;\nThe lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.\n21 My son, fear Jehovah and the king.\nAnd do not associate with dissenters,\n22 For their disaster will arise suddenly.\nWho knows what ruin both will bring upon them?\n23 These sayings also belong to the wise:\nPartiality in judgment is not good.\n24 Whoever says to the wicked one, \"You are righteous,\"\nWill be cursed by the peoples and denounced by the nations.\n25 But it will go well for those reproving him;\nBlessings of good things will come upon them.\n26 People will kiss the lips of the one replying honestly.\n27 Prepare your outside work, and get everything ready in the field;\nThen build your house.\n28 Do not testify against your neighbor without grounds.\nDo not use your lips to deceive others.\n29 Do not say: \"I will do to him just as he has done to me;\nI will repay him for what he did.\"\n30 I passed by the field of the lazy one,\nBy the vineyard of the man lacking good sense.\n31 I saw that it was overgrown with weeds;\nThe ground was covered with nettles,\nAnd its stone wall was broken down.\n32 I observed this and took it to heart;\nI saw it and learned this lesson:\n33 A little sleep, a little slumbering,\nA little folding of the hands to rest,\n34 And your poverty will come like a bandit,\nAnd your want like an armed man.\nChapter 25\n1 These also are the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah the king of Judah transcribed:\n2 It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret,\nAnd the glory of kings is to search through a matter.\n3 As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,\nSo the heart of kings is unsearchable.\n4 Remove the dross from the silver,\nAnd it will emerge completely refined.\n5 Remove the wicked one from the king's presence,\nAnd his throne will be firmly established in righteousness.\n6 Do not honor yourself before the king,\nAnd do not take a place among the prominent,\n7 For it is better for him to say to you, \"Come up here,\"\nThan to humiliate you in the presence of a noble.\n8 Do not rush into a legal dispute,\nFor what will you do later if your neighbor humiliates you?\n9 Plead your case with your neighbor,\nBut do not reveal what you were told confidentially,\n10 So that the one listening will not put you to shame\nAnd you spread a bad report that cannot be recalled.\n11 Like apples of gold in silver carvings\nIs a word spoken at the right time.\n12 Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold\nIs a wise reprover to the receptive ear.\n13 Just like the coldness of snow on the day of harvest\nIs a faithful messenger to those who sent him,\nFor he refreshes his master.\n14 Like clouds and wind that bring no rain\nIs a man who boasts about a gift never given.\n15 By patience a commander is won over,\nAnd a gentle tongue can break a bone.\n16 If you find honey, eat only what you need,\nFor if you take too much, you may vomit it up.\n17 Rarely set foot in your neighbor's house,\nSo that he does not get tired of you and hate you.\n18 Like a war club and a sword and a sharp arrow\nIs a man bearing false witness against his neighbor.\n19 Like a broken tooth or an unsteady foot\nIs confidence in an unreliable person in times of trouble.\n20 Like one who removes a garment on a cold day\nAnd like vinegar poured on soda\nIs the one who sings songs to a gloomy heart.\n21 If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;\nIf he is thirsty, give him water to drink,\n22 For you will be heaping burning coals on his head,\nAnd Jehovah will reward you.\n23 The north wind brings a downpour,\nAnd a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.\n24 Better to dwell on a corner of the roof\nThan in the same house with a quarrelsome wife.\n25 Like cold water on a tired soul\nIs a good report from a distant land.\n26 Like a muddied spring and a ruined well\nIs a righteous person who gives in to a wicked one.\n27 It is not good to eat too much honey,\nNor is it glorious to seek one's own glory.\n28 As a city broken through, without a wall,\nIs the man who cannot control his temper.\nChapter 26\n1 Like snow in summer and rain at harvesttime,\nHonor is not fitting for someone stupid.\n2 Just as a bird has reason to flee and a swallow to fly,\nSo a curse does not come without a real reason.\n3 A whip is for the horse, a bridle is for the donkey,\nAnd the rod is for the back of stupid people.\n4 Do not answer the stupid one according to his foolishness,\nSo that you do not put yourself on his level.\n5 Answer the stupid one according to his foolishness,\nSo that he does not think he is wise.\n6 Like someone who cripples his own feet and harms himself\nIs the one who entrusts matters to someone stupid.\n7 Like the limp legs of the lame,\nSo is a proverb in the mouth of stupid people.\n8 Like tying a stone to a sling,\nSo is giving glory to someone stupid.\n9 Like a thorn plant that comes into the hand of a drunkard,\nSo is a proverb in the mouth of stupid people.\n10 Like an archer who wounds at random,\nSo is the one who hires the stupid one or those passing by.\n11 Like a dog that returns to its vomit,\nThe stupid one repeats his foolishness.\n12 Have you seen a man who thinks he is wise?\nThere is more hope for someone stupid than for him.\n13 The lazy one says: \"There is a young lion in the road,\nA lion in the public square!\"\n14 A door keeps turning on its hinges,\nAnd the lazy one on his bed.\n15 The lazy one buries his hand in the banquet bowl,\nBut he is too tired to bring it back to his mouth.\n16 The lazy one thinks he is wiser\nThan seven people who give a sensible reply.\n17 Like someone grabbing hold of a dog's ears\nIs the one passing by who becomes furious about a quarrel that is not his.\n18 Like a madman who shoots fiery missiles, arrows, and death\n19 Is the man who plays a trick on his neighbor and says, \"I was only joking!\"\n20 Where there is no wood, the fire goes out,\nAnd where there is no slanderer, quarreling ceases.\n21 As charcoal for the embers and wood for the fire,\nSo a contentious man kindles a quarrel.\n22 The words of a slanderer are like tasty morsels;\nThey are gulped right down into the stomach.\n23 Like a silver glazing over a piece of earthenware\nAre affectionate words from an evil heart.\n24 The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,\nBut inside he harbors deceit.\n25 Although he speaks graciously, do not trust him,\nFor there are seven detestable things in his heart.\n26 Though his hatred is concealed by deceit,\nHis evil will be exposed in the congregation.\n27 The one who digs a pit will fall into it,\nAnd whoever rolls away a stone-it will come back on him.\n28 A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,\nAnd a flattering mouth causes ruin.\nChapter 27\n1 Do not boast about tomorrow,\nFor you do not know what a day will bring.\n2 Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth;\nOthers, and not your own lips.\n3 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,\nBut the irritation caused by a fool is heavier than both.\n4 There is the cruelty of rage and the flood of anger,\nBut who can withstand jealousy?\n5 Open reproof is better than concealed love.\n6 The wounds inflicted by a friend are faithful,\nBut an enemy's kisses are plentiful.\n7 One whose appetite is satisfied turns down honey from the comb,\nBut to the hungry, even what is bitter tastes sweet.\n8 Like a bird that strays from its nest\nIs a man who strays from his home.\n9 Oil and incense make the heart rejoice;\nSo does sweet friendship springing from sincere counsel.\n10 Do not forsake your friend or your father's friend,\nAnd do not enter your own brother's house on the day of your disaster;\nBetter is a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.\n11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice,\nSo that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.\n12 The shrewd person sees the danger and conceals himself,\nBut the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.\n13 Take a man's garment if he has given security for a stranger;\nSeize the pledge from him if he did so for a foreign woman.\n14 When someone blesses his fellow man with a loud voice early in the morning,\nIt will be counted as a curse to him.\n15 A quarrelsome wife is like a constantly leaking roof on a rainy day.\n16 Whoever can restrain her can restrain the wind\nAnd can grip oil with his right hand.\n17 As iron sharpens iron,\nSo one man sharpens his friend.\n18 The one who cares for a fig tree will eat its fruit,\nAnd the one who takes care of his master will be honored.\n19 As water reflects one's face,\nSo the heart of one man reflects another's.\n20 The Grave and the place of destruction are never satisfied,\nNor are a man's eyes ever satisfied.\n21 As the refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,\nSo a person is tested by the praise he receives.\n22 Even if you pound a fool with a pestle\nLike crushed grain in a mortar,\nHis foolishness will not leave him.\n23 You should know well the appearance of your flock.\nTake good care of your sheep,\n24 For wealth does not last forever,\nNor a crown for all generations.\n25 The green grass disappears, new grass appears,\nAnd the vegetation of the mountains is gathered in.\n26 The young rams provide your clothing,\nAnd the male goats provide the price of a field.\n27 And there will be enough goat's milk to feed you,\nTo feed your household, and to sustain your servant girls.\nChapter 28\n1 The wicked flee when no one pursues them,\nBut the righteous are as confident as a lion.\n2 When there is transgression in the land, it will have one prince after another,\nBut with the help of a man of discernment and knowledge, a prince will long endure.\n3 A poor man who defrauds the lowly\nIs like a rain that sweeps away all the food.\n4 Those who abandon the law praise the wicked one,\nBut those who observe the law are indignant with them.\n5 Evil men cannot understand justice,\nBut those who seek Jehovah can understand everything.\n6 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity\nThan a rich man whose ways are corrupt.\n7 An understanding son observes the law,\nBut a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.\n8 The one who increases his wealth by interest and usury\nAmasses it for the one who shows favor to the poor.\n9 The one refusing to listen to the law\n-Even his prayer is detestable.\n10 The one misleading the upright into an evil course will fall into his own pit,\nBut the blameless will inherit what is good.\n11 A rich man is wise in his own eyes,\nBut a poor man with discernment can see through him.\n12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,\nBut when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.\n13 The one covering over his transgressions will not succeed,\nBut whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy.\n14 Happy is the man who is always on guard,\nBut whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity.\n15 Like a growling lion and a charging bear\nIs a wicked ruler over a helpless people.\n16 A leader without discernment abuses his power,\nBut the one hating dishonest profit will prolong his life.\n17 A man burdened with bloodguilt for taking someone's life will keep fleeing until the grave.\nLet no one support him.\n18 The one walking faultlessly will be saved,\nBut the one whose ways are crooked will suddenly fall.\n19 The one cultivating his ground will have plenty of bread,\nBut the one taking up worthless pursuits will have his fill of poverty.\n20 A faithful man will receive many blessings,\nBut the one hastening to get rich will not remain innocent.\n21 It is not good to show partiality;\nBut a man might do wrong for a piece of bread.\n22 An envious man is eager for wealth,\nNot knowing that poverty will overtake him.\n23 Whoever reproves a man will afterward find more favor\nThan someone who flatters with his tongue.\n24 Whoever robs his father and mother and says, \"It is not wrong,\"\nIs a partner of the man who causes ruin.\n25 The greedy person stirs up dissension,\nBut whoever relies on Jehovah will prosper.\n26 Whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid,\nBut the one who walks in wisdom will escape.\n27 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing,\nBut the one who closes his eyes to them will receive many curses.\n28 When the wicked rise to power, a man hides himself,\nBut when they perish, the righteous increase.\nChapter 29\n1 A man who stiffens his neck after much reproof\nWill suddenly be broken beyond healing.\n2 When the righteous are many, the people rejoice,\nBut when the wicked one rules, the people groan.\n3 A man who loves wisdom makes his father rejoice,\nBut the one who keeps company with prostitutes squanders his wealth.\n4 By justice a king brings stability to a land,\nBut a man seeking bribes brings it to ruin.\n5 A man who flatters his neighbor\nSpreads out a net for his feet.\n6 A bad man's transgression ensnares him,\nBut the righteous one cries out joyfully and rejoices.\n7 The righteous one is concerned about the legal rights of the poor,\nBut the wicked one has no such concern.\n8 Boastful men inflame a town,\nBut those who are wise turn away anger.\n9 When a wise man enters into a controversy with a fool,\nThere will be ranting and ridicule, but no satisfaction.\n10 Bloodthirsty men hate anyone innocent,\nAnd they seek to take the life of the upright.\n11 A stupid person gives vent to all his feelings,\nBut the wise one calmly keeps them in check.\n12 When a ruler pays attention to lies,\nAll his servants will be wicked.\n13 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:\nJehovah gives light to the eyes of both.\n14 When a king judges the poor fairly,\nHis throne will always be secure.\n15 The rod and reproof impart wisdom,\nBut a child left unrestrained brings shame on his mother.\n16 When the wicked increase, transgression increases,\nBut the righteous will see their downfall.\n17 Discipline your son and he will bring you rest;\nAnd he will give you great pleasure.\n18 Where there is no vision, the people go unrestrained,\nBut happy are those who observe the law.\n19 A servant will not let himself be corrected by words,\nFor though he understands, he does not obey.\n20 Have you seen a man hasty with his words?\nThere is more hope for a fool than for him.\n21 If a servant is pampered from his youth,\nHe will become thankless later on.\n22 A man prone to anger stirs up strife;\nAnyone disposed to rage commits many transgressions.\n23 The haughtiness of a man will humble him,\nBut whoever is humble in spirit will obtain glory.\n24 The partner of a thief hates himself.\nHe may hear the call to testify, but he reports nothing.\n25 Trembling at men is a snare,\nBut the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected.\n26 Many seek an audience with a ruler,\nBut it is from Jehovah that a man gets justice.\n27 An unjust man is detestable to the righteous,\nBut the one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked one.\nChapter 30\n1 The weighty message contained in the words of Agur son of Jakeh, which he spoke to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal.\n2 I am more ignorant than anyone else,\nAnd I lack the understanding a man should have.\n3 I have not learned wisdom,\nAnd I do not possess the knowledge of the Most Holy One.\n4 Who has ascended to heaven and then descended?\nWho has gathered the wind in the palms of both hands?\nWho has wrapped up the waters in his garment?\nWho has established all the ends of the earth?\nWhat is his name and the name of his son-if you know?\n5 Every saying of God is refined.\nHe is a shield to those taking refuge in him.\n6 Add nothing to his words,\nOr he will reprove you,\nAnd you will be proved a liar.\n7 Two things I ask of you.\nDo not withhold them from me before I die.\n8 Remove untruth and lies far from me.\nGive me neither poverty nor riches.\nJust let me consume my portion of food,\n9 So that I do not become satisfied and deny you and say, \"Who is Jehovah?\"\nNor let me become poor and steal and dishonor the name of my God.\n10 Do not slander a servant to his master,\nOr he may curse you and you will be found guilty.\n11 There is a generation that curses its father\nAnd does not bless its mother.\n12 There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes\nBut has not been cleansed from its filth.\n13 There is a generation whose eyes are so haughty\nAnd whose eyes look so arrogantly!\n14 There is a generation whose teeth are swords\nAnd whose jaws are slaughtering knives;\nThey devour the lowly ones of the earth\nAnd the poor from among mankind.\n15 The leeches have two daughters that cry, \"Give! Give!\"\nThere are three things that do not get satisfied,\nFour that never say, \"Enough!\"\n16 -The Grave and a barren womb,\nA land that is deprived of water,\nAnd fire that never says, \"Enough!\"\n17 The eye that mocks a father and despises obedience to a mother\n-The ravens of the valley will peck it out,\nAnd the young eagles will eat it up.\n18 There are three things that are beyond my comprehension,\nAnd four that I do not understand:\n19 The way of an eagle in the heavens,\nThe way of a serpent on a rock,\nThe way of a ship in the open sea,\nAnd the way of a man with a young woman.\n20 This is the way of an adulterous woman:\nShe eats, she wipes her mouth;\nThen she says, \"I have done nothing wrong.\"\n21 There are three things that make the earth shudder\nAnd four things it cannot endure:\n22 When a slave rules as king,\nWhen a fool is glutted with food,\n23 When a hated woman is taken as a wife,\nAnd when a servant girl takes the place of her mistress.\n24 Four things on earth are among the smallest,\nBut they are instinctively wise:\n25 The ants are not strong creatures,\nYet they prepare their food in the summer.\n26 The rock badgers are not mighty creatures,\nYet they make their house in the crags.\n27 The locusts have no king,\nYet they all go forward in formation.\n28 The gecko lizard clings with its feet,\nAnd it goes into the palace of a king.\n29 There are three things that have an impressive stride,\nFour that are impressive as they move:\n30 The lion, the mightiest among beasts,\nWhich does not retreat from anyone;\n31 The greyhound; the male goat;\nAnd a king whose army is with him.\n32 If you have foolishly exalted yourself\nOr if you have schemed to do so,\nPut your hand over your mouth.\n33 For as the churning of milk produces butter\nAnd the squeezing of the nose produces blood,\nSo the stirring up of anger produces quarrels.\nChapter 31\n1 The words of King Lemuel, the weighty message his mother gave to instruct him:\n2 What should I tell you, O my son,\nWhat, O son of my womb,\nAnd what, O son of my vows?\n3 Do not give your vigor to women,\nNor follow ways that destroy kings.\n4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel,\nIt is not for kings to drink wine\nNor for rulers to say, \"Where is my drink?\"\n5 So that they do not drink and forget what is decreed\nAnd pervert the rights of the lowly ones.\n6 Give alcohol to those who are perishing\nAnd wine to those in bitter distress.\n7 Let them drink and forget their poverty;\nLet them remember their trouble no more.\n8 Speak up in behalf of the speechless;\nDefend the rights of all who are perishing.\n9 Speak up and judge righteously;\nDefend the rights of the lowly and the poor.\n?

During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit before they were united. 19 However, because her husband Joseph was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, he intended to divorce her secretly. 20 But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah's angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: \"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take your wife Mary home, for what has been conceived in her is by holy spirit. 21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.\" 22 All of this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: 23 \"Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,\" which means, when translated, \"With Us Is God.\"\n24 Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah had directed him, and he took his wife home. 25 But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.\nChapter 2\n1 After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, look! astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem, 2 saying: \"Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when we were in the East, and we have come to do obeisance to him.\" 3 At hearing this, King Herod was agitated, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 On gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. 5 They said to him: \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is how it has been written through the prophet: 6 'And you, O Bethlehem of the land of Judah, are by no means the most insignificant city among the governors of Judah, for out of you will come a governing one, who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\n7 Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star's appearing. 8 When sending them to Bethlehem, he said: \"Go make a careful search for the young child, and when you have found him, report back to me so that I too may go and do obeisance to him.\" 9 After they had heard the king, they went their way, and look! the star they had seen when they were in the East went ahead of them until it came to a stop above where the young child was. 10 On seeing the star, they rejoiced with great joy. 11 And when they went into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and falling down, they did obeisance to him. They also opened their treasures and presented him with gifts-gold and frankincense and myrrh. 12 However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their country by another way.\n13 After they had departed, look! Jehovah's angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: \"Get up, take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I give you word, for Herod is about to search for the young child to kill him.\" 14 So Joseph got up and by night took along the young child and the child's mother and went into Egypt. 15 He stayed there until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\"\n16 Then Herod, seeing that he had been outwitted by the astrologers, flew into a great rage, and he sent out and had all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts killed, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers. 17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, who said: 18 \"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and much wailing. It was Rachel weeping for her children, and she was unwilling to take comfort, because they are no more.\"\n19 When Herod had died, look! Jehovah's angel appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt 20 and said: \"Get up, take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the young child are dead.\" 21 So he got up and took the young child and the child's mother and entered into the land of Israel. 22 But hearing that Archelaus ruled Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Moreover, being given divine warning in a dream, he withdrew into the territory of Galilee. 23 And he came and settled in a city named Nazareth, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: \"He will be called a Nazarene.\"\nChapter 3\n1 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 2 saying: \"Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.\" 3 This, in fact, is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words: \"A voice of one calling out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight.'\" 4 Now John was clothed with camel's hair and had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country around the Jordan were going out to him, 6 and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins.\n7 When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism, he said to them: \"You offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8 Therefore, produce fruit that befits repentance. 9 Do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones. 10 The ax is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire. 11 I, for my part, baptize you with water because of your repentance, but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to take off. That one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire. 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean up his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.\"\n13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, in order to be baptized by him. 14 But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: \"I am the one who needs to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?\" 15 Jesus replied to him: \"Let it be this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.\" Then he quit preventing him. 16 After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God's spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. 17 Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: \"This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.\"\nChapter 4\n1 Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. 2 After he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, he felt hungry. 3 And the Tempter approached and said to him: \"If you are a son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.\" 4 But he answered: \"It is written: 'Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah's mouth.'\"\n5 Then the Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple 6 and said to him: \"If you are a son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will give his angels a command concerning you,' and, 'They will carry you on their hands, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.'\" 7 Jesus said to him: \"Again it is written: 'You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.'\"\n8 Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 9 And he said to him: \"All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.\" 10 Then Jesus said to him: \"Go away, Satan! For it is written: 'It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.'\" 11 Then the Devil left him, and look! angels came and began to minister to him.\n12 Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. 13 Further, after leaving Nazareth, he came and took up residence in Capernaum beside the sea in the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali, 14 so as to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said: 15 \"O land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! 16 The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose on them.\" 17 From that time on, Jesus began preaching and saying: \"Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.\"\n18 Walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 19 And he said to them: \"Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.\" 20 At once they abandoned their nets and followed him. 21 Going on from there, he saw two others who were brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 22 At once they left the boat and their father and followed him.\n23 Then he went throughout the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people. 24 And the report about him spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all those who were suffering with various diseases and torments, those who were demon-possessed and epileptic and paralyzed, and he cured them. 25 Consequently, large crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other side of the Jordan.\nChapter 5\n1 When he saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 Then he opened his mouth and began teaching them, saying:\n3 \"Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.\n4 \"Happy are those who mourn, since they will be comforted.\n5 \"Happy are the mild-tempered, since they will inherit the earth.\n6 \"Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.\n7 \"Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.\n8 \"Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God.\n9 \"Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.\n10 \"Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.\n11 \"Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. 12 Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.\n13 \"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its strength, how will its saltiness be restored? It is no longer usable for anything except to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.\n14 \"You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when located on a mountain. 15 People light a lamp and set it, not under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house. 16 Likewise, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.\n17 \"Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. 18 Truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one stroke of a letter to pass away from the Law until all things take place. 19 Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in relation to the Kingdom of the heavens. 20 For I say to you that if your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.\n21 \"You heard that it was said to those of ancient times: 'You must not murder, but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.' 22 However, I say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; and whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, 'You despicable fool!' will be liable to the fiery Gehenna.\n23 \"If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away. First make your peace with your brother, and then come back and offer your gift.\n25 \"Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent, while you are with him on the way there, so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison. 26 I say to you for a fact, you will certainly not come out of there until you have paid over your last small coin.\n27 \"You heard that it was said: 'You must not commit adultery.' 28 But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If, now, your right eye is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be pitched into Gehenna. 30 Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to land in Gehenna.\n31 \"Moreover, it was said: 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' 32 However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n33 \"Again you heard that it was said to those of ancient times: 'You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.' 34 However, I say to you: Do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; 35 nor by earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Do not swear by your head, since you cannot turn one hair white or black. 37 Just let your word 'Yes' mean yes, your 'No,' no, for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one.\n38 \"You heard that it was said: 'Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.' 39 However, I say to you: Do not resist the one who is wicked, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him. 40 And if a person wants to take you to court and get possession of your inner garment, let him also have your outer garment; 41 and if someone in authority compels you into service for a mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one who wants to borrow from you.\n43 \"You heard that it was said: 'You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44 However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous. 46 For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing? 47 And if you greet your brothers only, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing? 48 You must accordingly be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\nChapter 6\n1 \"Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men to be noticed by them; otherwise you will have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. 2 So when you make gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 3 But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.\n5 \"Also, when you pray, do not act like the hypocrites, for they like to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the main streets to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your private room and, after shutting your door, pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you. 7 When praying, do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words. 8 So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.\n9 \"You must pray, then, this way:\n\"'Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. 10 Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth. 11 Give us today our bread for this day; 12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.'\n14 \"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; 15 whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n16 \"When you fast, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 17 But you, when fasting, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that you may not appear to be fasting to men but only to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you.\n19 \"Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal. 20 Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n22 \"The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is focused, your whole body will be bright. 23 But if your eye is envious, your whole body will be dark. If the light that is in you is really darkness, how great that darkness is!\n24 \"No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches.\n25 \"On this account I say to you: Stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. Does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing? 26 Observe intently the birds of heaven; they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? 27 Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span? 28 Also, why are you anxious about clothing? Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, nor do they spin; 29 but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. 30 Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith? 31 So never be anxious and say, 'What are we to eat?' or, 'What are we to drink?' or, 'What are we to wear?' 32 For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. Your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.\n33 \"Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. 34 So never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles.\nChapter 7\n1 \"Stop judging that you may not be judged; 2 for with the judgment you are judging, you will be judged, and with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you. 3 Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother's eye but do not notice the rafter in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, 'Allow me to remove the straw from your eye,' when look! a rafter is in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First remove the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brother's eye.\n6 \"Do not give what is holy to dogs nor throw your pearls before swine, so that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip you open.\n7 \"Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you; 8 for everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened. 9 Indeed, which one of you, if his son asks for bread, will hand him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, he will not hand him a serpent, will he? 11 Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him!\n12 \"All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them. This, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.\n13 \"Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are going in through it; 14 whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.\n15 \"Be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep's covering, but inside they are ravenous wolves. 16 By their fruits you will recognize them. Never do people gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? 17 Likewise, every good tree produces fine fruit, but every rotten tree produces worthless fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce fine fruit. 19 Every tree not producing fine fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 Really, then, by their fruits you will recognize those men.\n21 \"Not everyone saying to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. 22 Many will say to me in that day: 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?' 23 And then I will declare to them: 'I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!'\n24 \"Therefore, everyone who hears these sayings of mine and does them will be like a discreet man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded on the rock. 26 Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it caved in, and its collapse was great.\"\n28 When Jesus finished these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of teaching, 29 for he was teaching them as a person having authority, and not as their scribes.\nChapter 8\n1 After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. 2 And look! a leper came up and did obeisance to him, saying: \"Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.\" 3 So stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: \"I want to! Be made clean.\" Immediately his leprosy was cleansed away. 4 Then Jesus said to him: \"See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses appointed, for a witness to them.\"\n5 When he entered Capernaum, an army officer came to him, pleading with him 6 and saying: \"Sir, my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis, and he is suffering terribly.\" 7 He said to him: \"When I get there, I will cure him.\" 8 The army officer replied: \"Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but just say the word and my servant will be healed. 9 For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it.\" 10 When Jesus heard that, he was amazed and said to those following him: \"I tell you the truth, with no one in Israel have I found so great a faith. 11 But I tell you that many from east and west will come and recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the heavens; 12 whereas the sons of the Kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.\" 13 Then Jesus said to the army officer: \"Go. Just as you have shown faith, so let it come to pass for you.\" And the servant was healed in that hour.\n14 And Jesus, on coming into Peter's house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and sick with fever. 15 So he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began ministering to him. 16 But after it became evening, people brought him many demon-possessed ones; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and he cured all who were suffering, 17 in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: \"He himself took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.\"\n18 When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the command to depart for the other side. 19 And a scribe came up and said to him: \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" 20 But Jesus said to him: \"Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.\" 21 Then another of the disciples said to him: \"Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.\" 22 Jesus said to him: \"Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.\"\n23 And when he went aboard a boat, his disciples followed him. 24 Now look! a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; but he was sleeping. 25 And they came and woke him up, saying: \"Lord, save us, we are about to perish!\" 26 But he said to them: \"Why are you so afraid, you with little faith?\" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm set in. 27 So the men were amazed and said: \"What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him.\"\n28 When he came to the other side into the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming out from among the tombs met him. They were unusually fierce, so nobody had the courage to pass by on that road. 29 And look! they screamed, saying: \"What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?\" 30 A long way off from them, a herd of many swine was feeding. 31 So the demons began to plead with him, saying: \"If you expel us, send us into the herd of swine.\" 32 And he said to them: \"Go!\" With that they came out and went off into the swine, and look! the entire herd rushed over the precipice into the sea and died in the waters. 33 But the herders fled, and going into the city, they reported everything, including the account of the demon-possessed men. 34 And look! all the city turned out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they urged him to depart from their region.\nChapter 9\n1 So boarding the boat, he traveled across and went into his own city. 2 And look! they were bringing him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. On seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic: \"Take courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.\" 3 Now certain scribes said to themselves: \"This fellow is blaspheming.\" 4 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: \"Why are you thinking wicked things in your hearts? 5 For instance, which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? 6 However, in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins-\" then he said to the paralytic: \"Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.\" 7 And he got up and went to his home. 8 When the crowds saw this, they were struck with fear, and they glorified God, who gave such authority to men.\n9 Next, while moving on from there, Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: \"Be my follower.\" At that he rose up and followed him. 10 Later as he was dining in the house, look! many tax collectors and sinners came and began dining with Jesus and his disciples. 11 But on seeing this, the Pharisees said to his disciples: \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\" 12 Hearing them, he said: \"Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. 13 Go, then, and learn what this means: 'I want mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.\"\n14 Then John's disciples came to him and asked: \"Why do we and the Pharisees practice fasting but your disciples do not fast?\" 15 At this Jesus said to them: \"The friends of the bridegroom have no reason to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, do they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. 16 Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old outer garment, for the new piece pulls away from the garment and the tear becomes worse. 17 Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\"\n18 While he was telling them these things, look! a certain ruler who had approached did obeisance to him, saying: \"By now my daughter must be dead, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will come to life.\"\n19 Then Jesus got up and, with his disciples, followed him. 20 And look! a woman suffering for 12 years from a flow of blood approached from behind and touched the fringe of his outer garment, 21 for she kept saying to herself: \"If I only touch his outer garment, I will get well.\" 22 Jesus turned around and, noticing her, said: \"Take courage, daughter! Your faith has made you well.\" And from that hour the woman was made well.\n23 When, now, he came into the ruler's house and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, 24 Jesus said: \"Leave the place, for the little girl did not die but is sleeping.\" At this they began to laugh at him scornfully. 25 As soon as the crowd had been sent outside, he went in and took hold of her hand, and the little girl got up. 26 Of course, the talk about this spread into all that region.\n27 As Jesus moved on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting out: \"Have mercy on us, Son of David.\" 28 After he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them: \"Do you have faith that I can do this?\" They answered him: \"Yes, Lord.\" 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying: \"According to your faith let it happen to you.\" 30 And their eyes received sight. Moreover, Jesus sternly warned them, saying: \"See that nobody gets to know it.\" 31 But after going outside, they made it public about him in all that region.\n32 When they were leaving, look! people brought him a speechless man possessed of a demon; 33 and after the demon had been expelled, the speechless man spoke. Well, the crowds were amazed and said: \"Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.\" 34 But the Pharisees were saying: \"It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons.\"\n35 And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity. 36 On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples: \"Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. 38 Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.\"\nChapter 10\n1 So he summoned his 12 disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.\n2 The names of the 12 apostles are these: First, Simon, the one called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee and John his brother; 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; and Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Cananaean; and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.\n5 These 12 Jesus sent out, giving them these instructions: \"Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter any Samaritan city; 6 but instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 As you go, preach, saying: 'The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.' 8 Cure the sick, raise up the dead, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free. 9 Do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your money belts, 10 or a food pouch for the trip, or two garments, or sandals, or a staff, for the worker deserves his food.\n11 \"Into whatever city or village you enter, search out who in it is deserving, and stay there until you leave. 12 When you enter the house, greet the household. 13 If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return upon you. 14 Wherever anyone does not receive you or listen to your words, on going out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet. 15 Truly I say to you, it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on Judgment Day than for that city.\n16 \"Look! I am sending you out as sheep among wolves; so prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves. 17 Be on your guard against men, for they will hand you over to local courts and they will scourge you in their synagogues. 18 And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations. 19 However, when they hand you over, do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak, for what you are to speak will be given you in that hour; 20 for the ones speaking are not just you, but it is the spirit of your Father that speaks by you. 21 Further, brother will hand brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death. 22 And you will be hated by all people on account of my name, but the one who has endured to the end will be saved. 23 When they persecute you in one city, flee to another; for truly I say to you, you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.\n24 \"A student is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. 25 It is enough for the student to become as his teacher, and the slave as his master. If people have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household? 26 So do not fear them, for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. 27 What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, preach from the housetops. 28 And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. 29 Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 So have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.\n32 \"Everyone, then, who acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in the heavens. 33 But whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens. 34 Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth; I came to bring, not peace, but a sword. 35 For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. 36 Indeed, a man's enemies will be those of his own household. 37 Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and whoever has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his soul will lose it, and whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.\n40 \"Whoever receives you receives me also, and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me. 41 Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet's reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous man's reward. 42 And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, I tell you truly, he will by no means lose his reward.\"\nChapter 11\n1 When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his 12 disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities.\n2 But John, having heard in jail about the works of the Christ, sent his disciples 3 to ask him: \"Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?\" 4 In reply Jesus said to them: \"Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing: 5 The blind are now seeing and the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news. 6 Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me.\"\n7 While these were on their way, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being tossed by the wind? 8 What, then, did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Why, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings. 9 Really, then, why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. 10 This is the one about whom it is written: 'Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way ahead of you!' 11 Truly I say to you, among those born of women, there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist, but a lesser person in the Kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is. 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press, and those pressing forward are seizing it. 13 For all, the Prophets and the Law, prophesied until John; 14 and if you are willing to accept it, he is 'Elijah who is to come.' 15 Let the one who has ears listen.\n16 \"With whom will I compare this generation? It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates, 17 saying: 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.' 18 Likewise, John came neither eating nor drinking, but people say, 'He has a demon.' 19 The Son of man did come eating and drinking, but people say, 'Look! A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by its works.\"\n20 Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his powerful works had taken place, for they did not repent: 21 \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes. 22 But I say to you, it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on Judgment Day than for you. 23 And you, Capernaum, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to the Grave you will come; because if the powerful works that took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until this very day. 24 But I say to you, it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on Judgment Day than for you.\"\n25 At that time Jesus said in response: \"I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to young children. 26 Yes, O Father, because this is the way you approved. 27 All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him. 28 Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves. 30 For my yoke is kindly, and my load is light.\"\nChapter 12\n1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat. 2 At seeing this, the Pharisees said to him: \"Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.\" 3 He said to them: \"Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry? 4 How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, something that it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat, but for the priests only? 5 Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and continue guiltless? 6 But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 7 However, if you had understood what this means, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless ones. 8 For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.\"\n9 After departing from that place, he went into their synagogue, 10 and look! there was a man with a withered hand! So they asked him, \"Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?\" so that they might accuse him. 11 He said to them: \"If you have one sheep and that sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, is there a man among you who will not grab hold of it and lift it out? 12 How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the Sabbath.\" 13 Then he said to the man: \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand. 14 But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him to kill him. 15 Having come to know this, Jesus departed from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all, 16 but he sternly ordered them not to make him known, 17 in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said:\n18 \"Look! My servant whom I chose, my beloved, whom I have approved! I will put my spirit upon him, and what justice is he will make clear to the nations. 19 He will not quarrel nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the main streets. 20 No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering wick will he extinguish, until he brings justice with success. 21 Indeed, in his name nations will hope.\"\n22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and speechless, and he cured him, so that the speechless man could speak and see. 23 Well, all the crowds were astounded and began to say: \"May this not perhaps be the Son of David?\" 24 At hearing this, the Pharisees said: \"This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.\" 25 Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: \"Every kingdom divided against itself comes to ruin, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. 26 In the same way, if Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself; how, then, will his kingdom stand? 27 Moreover, if I expel the demons by means of Beelzebub, by whom do your sons expel them? This is why they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by means of God's spirit that I expel the demons, the Kingdom of God has really overtaken you. 29 Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Only then can he plunder his house. 30 Whoever is not on my side is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\n31 \"For this reason I say to you, every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven. 32 For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.\n33 \"Either you make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, for by its fruit the tree is known. 34 Offspring of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are wicked? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things, whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things. 36 I tell you that men will render an account on Judgment Day for every unprofitable saying that they speak; 37 for by your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n38 Then as an answer to him, some of the scribes and the Pharisees said: \"Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.\" 39 In reply he said to them: \"A wicked and adulterous generation keeps on seeking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. 40 For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. 41 Men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at what Jonah preached. But look! something more than Jonah is here. 42 The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look! something more than Solomon is here.\n43 \"When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through waterless places in search of a resting-place and finds none. 44 Then it says, 'I will go back to my house from which I moved,' and on arriving, it finds the house unoccupied but swept clean and adorned. 45 Then it goes and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself, and after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first. That is how it will be also with this wicked generation.\"\n46 While he was yet speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to him. 47 So someone said to him: \"Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.\" 48 In reply he said to the one who spoke to him: \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" 49 And extending his hand toward his disciples, he said: \"Look! My mother and my brothers! 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that one is my brother and sister and mother.\"\nChapter 13\n1 On that day Jesus left the house and was sitting by the sea. 2 And such large crowds gathered to him that he went aboard a boat and sat down, and all the crowd was standing on the beach. 3 Then he told them many things by illustrations, saying: \"Look! A sower went out to sow. 4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell alongside the road, and the birds came and ate them up. 5 Others fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil, and they immediately sprang up because the soil was not deep. 6 But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them. 8 Still others fell on the fine soil, and they began to yield fruit, this one 100 times more, that one 60, the other 30. 9 Let the one who has ears listen.\"\n10 So the disciples came and said to him: \"Why do you speak to them by the use of illustrations?\" 11 In reply he said: \"To you it is granted to understand the sacred secrets of the Kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not granted. 12 For whoever has, more will be given him, and he will be made to abound; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. 13 That is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations; for looking, they look in vain, and hearing, they hear in vain, nor do they get the sense of it. 14 And the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled in their case. It says: 'You will indeed hear but by no means get the sense of it, and you will indeed look but by no means see. 15 For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes, so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back and I heal them.'\n16 \"However, happy are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear. 17 For truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things you are observing but did not see them, and to hear the things you are hearing but did not hear them.\n18 \"Now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed. 19 Where anyone hears the word of the Kingdom but does not get the sense of it, the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is the one sown alongside the road. 20 As for the one sown on rocky ground, this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy. 21 Yet, he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word, he is at once stumbled. 22 As for the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 23 As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one 100 times more, that one 60, the other 30.\"\n24 He presented another illustration to them, saying: \"The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a man who sowed fine seed in his field. 25 While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat and left. 26 When the stalk sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared. 27 So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it have weeds?' 28 He said to them, 'An enemy, a man, did this.' The slaves said to him, 'Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them?' 29 He said, 'No, for fear that while collecting the weeds, you uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest season, I will tell the reapers: First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up; then gather the wheat into my storehouse.'\"\n31 He presented another illustration to them, saying: \"The Kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard grain that a man took and planted in his field. 32 It is, in fact, the tiniest of all the seeds, but when it has grown, it is the largest of the vegetable plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and find lodging among its branches.\"\n33 He told them another illustration: \"The Kingdom of the heavens is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour until the whole mass was fermented.\"\n34 All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them, 35 in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said: \"I will open my mouth with illustrations; I will proclaim things hidden since the founding.\"\n36 Then after dismissing the crowds, he went into the house. His disciples came to him and said: \"Explain to us the illustration of the weeds in the field.\" 37 In response he said: \"The sower of the fine seed is the Son of man; 38 the field is the world. As for the fine seed, these are the sons of the Kingdom, but the weeds are the sons of the wicked one, 39 and the enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things, and the reapers are angels. 40 Therefore, just as the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be in the conclusion of the system of things. 41 The Son of man will send his angels, and they will collect out from his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling and people who practice lawlessness, 42 and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be. 43 At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Let the one who has ears listen.\n44 \"The Kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure, hidden in the field, that a man found and hid; and because of his joy, he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.\n45 \"Again the Kingdom of the heavens is like a traveling merchant seeking fine pearls. 46 Upon finding one pearl of high value, he went away and promptly sold all the things he had and bought it.\n47 \"Again the Kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet let down into the sea and gathering fish of every kind. 48 When it was full, they hauled it up onto the beach, and sitting down, they collected the fine ones into containers, but the unsuitable they threw away. 49 That is how it will be in the conclusion of the system of things. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from among the righteous 50 and will cast them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.\n51 \"Did you get the sense of all these things?\" They said to him: \"Yes.\" 52 Then he said to them: \"That being the case, every public instructor who is taught about the Kingdom of the heavens is like a man, the master of the house, who brings out of his treasure store things both new and old.\"\n53 When Jesus had finished these illustrations, he departed from there. 54 After coming into his home territory, he began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said: \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these powerful works? 55 Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did he get all of this?\" 57 So they began to stumble because of him. But Jesus said to them: \"A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and in his own house.\" 58 And he did not perform many powerful works there on account of their lack of faith.\nChapter 14\n1 At that time Herod, the district ruler, heard the report about Jesus 2 and said to his servants: \"This is John the Baptist. He was raised up from the dead, and this is why these powerful works are operating in him.\" 3 Herod had arrested John and had bound him and imprisoned him because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother. 4 For John had been saying to him: \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" 5 However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet. 6 But when Herod's birthday was being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced for the occasion and pleased Herod so much 7 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 8 Then she, at her mother's prompting, said: \"Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\" 9 Grieved though he was, the king, out of regard for his oaths and for those dining with him, commanded it to be given. 10 So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. 11 His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 12 Later his disciples came and removed his corpse and buried him; then they came and reported to Jesus. 13 At hearing this, Jesus departed from there by boat into an isolated place to be alone. But the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities.\n14 When he came ashore, he saw a large crowd, and he felt pity for them, and he cured their sick ones. 15 But when evening fell, his disciples came to him and said: \"The place is isolated and the hour is already late; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.\" 16 However, Jesus said to them: \"They do not have to leave; you give them something to eat.\" 17 They said to him: \"We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.\" 18 He said: \"Bring them here to me.\" 19 And he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said a blessing, and after breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 20 So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, 12 baskets full. 21 Now those eating were about 5,000 men, as well as women and young children. 22 Then, without delay, he made his disciples board the boat and go ahead of him to the opposite shore, while he sent the crowds away.\n23 After sending the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. 24 By now the boat was many hundreds of yards away from land, struggling against the waves because the wind was against them. 25 But in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 26 When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: \"It is an apparition!\" And they cried out in their fear. 27 But at once Jesus spoke to them, saying: \"Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.\" 28 Peter answered him: \"Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.\" 29 He said: \"Come!\" So Peter got out of the boat and walked over the waters and went toward Jesus. 30 But looking at the windstorm, he became afraid. And when he started to sink, he cried out: \"Lord, save me!\" 31 Immediately stretching out his hand, Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: \"You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?\" 32 After they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated. 33 Then those in the boat did obeisance to him, saying: \"You really are God's Son.\" 34 And they crossed over and came to land in Gennesaret.\n35 On recognizing him, the men of that place sent word into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill. 36 And they pleaded with him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment, and all those who touched it were made completely well.\nChapter 15\n1 Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying: 2 \"Why do your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? For example, they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal.\"\n3 In reply he said to them: \"Why do you overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? 4 For example, God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Let the one who speaks abusively of his father or mother be put to death.' 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother: \"Whatever I have that could benefit you is a gift dedicated to God,\" 6 he need not honor his father at all.' So you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. 7 You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you when he said: 8 'This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. 9 It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.'\" 10 With that he called the crowd near and said to them: \"Listen and get the sense of it: 11 It is not what enters into a man's mouth that defiles him, but it is what comes out of his mouth that defiles him.\"\n12 Then the disciples came and said to him: \"Do you know that the Pharisees were stumbled at hearing what you said?\" 13 In reply he said: \"Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. 14 Let them be. Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\" 15 Peter responded: \"Make the illustration plain to us.\" 16 At this he said: \"Are you also still without understanding? 17 Are you not aware that whatever enters into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer? 18 However, whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and those things defile a man. 19 For example, out of the heart come wicked reasonings: murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies. 20 These are the things that defile a man; but to take a meal with unwashed hands does not defile a man.\"\n21 Leaving there, Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And look! a Phoenician woman from that region came and cried out: \"Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is cruelly demon possessed.\" 23 But he did not say a word in answer to her. So his disciples came and began to urge him: \"Send her away, because she keeps crying out after us.\" 24 He answered: \"I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" 25 But the woman came and did obeisance to him, saying: \"Lord, help me!\" 26 In answer he said: \"It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.\" 27 She said: \"Yes, Lord, but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.\" 28 Then Jesus replied to her: \"O woman, great is your faith; let it happen to you as you wish.\" And her daughter was healed from that hour on.\n29 Departing from there, Jesus next came near the Sea of Galilee, and after going up on the mountain, he was sitting there. 30 Then large crowds approached him, bringing along people who were lame, maimed, blind, speechless, and many others, and they laid them at his feet, and he cured them. 31 So the crowd felt amazement as they saw the speechless speaking and the maimed being made sound and the lame walking and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.\n32 But Jesus called his disciples to him and said: \"I feel pity for the crowd, because they have already stayed with me for three days and they have had nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, for they may give out on the road.\" 33 However, the disciples said to him: \"Where in this isolated place are we going to get enough bread to satisfy a crowd of this size?\" 34 At this Jesus said to them: \"How many loaves do you have?\" They said: \"Seven, and a few small fish.\" 35 So after instructing the crowd to recline on the ground, 36 he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after offering thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 37 And all ate and were satisfied, and they took up seven large baskets full of leftover fragments. 38 Now those eating were 4,000 men, as well as women and young children. 39 Finally, after sending the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the region of Magadan.\nChapter 16\n1 Here the Pharisees and Sadducees approached him, and to test him, they asked him to display to them a sign from heaven. 2 In reply he said to them: \"When evening falls, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is fire-red,' 3 and in the morning, 'It will be wintry, rainy weather today, for the sky is fire-red but gloomy.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot interpret. 4 A wicked and adulterous generation keeps seeking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\" With that he went away, leaving them behind.\n5 Now the disciples crossed to the other side and forgot to take bread along. 6 Jesus said to them: \"Keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" 7 So they began to reason among themselves, saying: \"We did not take any loaves along.\" 8 Knowing this, Jesus said: \"Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no loaves, you with little faith? 9 Do you not yet see the point, or do you not remember the five loaves in the case of the 5,000 and how many baskets you took up? 10 Or the seven loaves in the case of the 4,000 and how many large baskets you took up? 11 How is it you do not discern that I did not speak to you about bread? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" 12 Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of bread, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\n13 When he had come into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples: \"Who are men saying the Son of man is?\" 14 They said: \"Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" 15 He said to them: \"You, though, who do you say I am?\" 16 Simon Peter answered: \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" 17 In response Jesus said to him: \"Happy you are, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but my Father in the heavens did. 18 Also, I say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my congregation, and the gates of the Grave will not overpower it. 19 I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will already be bound in the heavens, and whatever you may loosen on earth will already be loosened in the heavens.\" 20 Then he sternly instructed the disciples not to tell anybody that he was the Christ.\n21 From that time forward, Jesus began explaining to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up. 22 At this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying: \"Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this happen to you at all.\" 23 But turning his back, he said to Peter: \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God's thoughts, but those of men.\"\n24 Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me. 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. 26 Really, what good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? 27 For the Son of man is to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will repay each one according to his behavior. 28 Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his Kingdom.\"\nChapter 17\n1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John along and led them up into a lofty mountain by themselves. 2 And he was transfigured before them; his face shone as the sun, and his outer garments became brilliant as the light. 3 And look! there appeared to them Moses and Elijah conversing with him. 4 Then Peter said to Jesus: \"Lord, it is fine for us to be here. If you wish, I will erect three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\" 5 While he was still speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and look! a voice out of the cloud said: \"This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. Listen to him.\" 6 At hearing this, the disciples fell facedown and became very much afraid. 7 Then Jesus came near, and touching them, he said: \"Get up. Have no fear.\" 8 When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus himself. 9 As they were descending from the mountain, Jesus commanded them: \"Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.\"\n10 However, the disciples put the question to him: \"Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?\" 11 In reply he said: \"Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things. 12 However, I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him but did whatever they wanted with him. In this way also, the Son of man is going to suffer at their hands.\" 13 Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.\n14 When they came toward the crowd, a man approached him, knelt down to him, and said: 15 \"Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and is ill. He falls often into the fire and often into the water. 16 I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.\" 17 In reply Jesus said: \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.\" 18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: \"Why could we not expel it?\" 20 He said to them: \"Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.\" 21 --\n22 It was while they were gathered together in Galilee that Jesus said to them: \"The Son of man is going to be betrayed into men's hands, 23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.\" And they were very much grieved.\n24 After they arrived in Capernaum, the men collecting the two drachmas tax approached Peter and said: \"Does your teacher not pay the two drachmas tax?\" 25 He said: \"Yes.\" However, when he entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first and said: \"What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax? From their sons or from the strangers?\" 26 When he said: \"From the strangers,\" Jesus said to him: \"Really, then, the sons are tax-free. 27 But that we do not cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a fishhook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.\"\nChapter 18\n1 In that hour the disciples came near to Jesus and said: \"Who really is greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens?\" 2 So calling a young child to him, he stood him in their midst 3 and said: \"Truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become as young children, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens. 4 Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one who is the greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens; 5 and whoever receives one such young child on the basis of my name receives me also. 6 But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith in me, it would be better for him to have hung around his neck a millstone that is turned by a donkey and to be sunk in the open sea.\n7 \"Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! Of course, it is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes! 8 If, then, your hand or your foot makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to be thrown with two hands or two feet into the everlasting fire. 9 Also, if your eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter one-eyed into life than to be thrown with two eyes into the fiery Gehenna. 10 See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my Father who is in heaven. 11 --\n12 \"What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays, will he not leave the 99 on the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying? 13 And if he finds it, I certainly tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the 99 that have not strayed. 14 Likewise, it is not a desirable thing to my Father who is in heaven for even one of these little ones to perish.\n15 \"Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go and reveal his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 16 But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. 17 If he does not listen to them, speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.\n18 \"Truly I say to you, whatever things you may bind on earth will be things already bound in heaven, and whatever things you may loosen on earth will be things already loosened in heaven. 19 Again I tell you truly, if two of you on earth agree concerning anything of importance that they should request, it will take place for them on account of my Father in heaven. 20 For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.\"\n21 Then Peter came and said to him: \"Lord, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven times?\" 22 Jesus said to him: \"I say to you, not up to seven times, but up to 77 times.\n23 \"That is why the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. 24 When he started to settle them, a man was brought in who owed him 10,000 talents. 25 But because he did not have the means to pay it back, his master ordered him and his wife and his children and all the things he owned to be sold and payment to be made. 26 So the slave fell down and did obeisance to him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything to you.' 27 Moved with pity at this, the master of that slave let him off and canceled his debt. 28 But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him 100 denarii, and grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay back whatever you owe.' 29 So his fellow slave fell down and began to beg him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.' 30 However, he was not willing, but he went and had him thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed. 31 When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they became greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all the things that had happened. 32 Then his master summoned him and said to him: 'Wicked slave, I canceled all that debt for you when you pleaded with me. 33 Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you?' 34 With that his master, provoked to wrath, handed him over to the jailers until he repaid all that he owed. 35 My heavenly Father will also deal with you in the same way if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart.\"\nChapter 19\n1 When Jesus had finished speaking these things, he departed from Galilee and came to the borders of Judea across the Jordan. 2 Also, large crowds followed him, and he cured them there.\n3 And Pharisees came to him intent on testing him, and they asked: \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on every sort of grounds?\" 4 In reply he said: \"Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female 5 and said: 'For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh'? 6 So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.\" 7 They said to him: \"Why, then, did Moses direct giving a certificate of dismissal and divorcing her?\" 8 He said to them: \"Out of regard for your hard-heartedness, Moses made the concession to you of divorcing your wives, but that has not been the case from the beginning. 9 I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery.\"\n10 The disciples said to him: \"If that is the situation of a man with his wife, it is not advisable to marry.\" 11 He said to them: \"Not all men make room for the saying, but only those who have the gift. 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs on account of the Kingdom of the heavens. Let the one who can make room for it make room for it.\"\n13 Then young children were brought to him for him to place his hands on them and offer prayer, but the disciples reprimanded them. 14 Jesus, however, said: \"Let the young children alone, and do not try to stop them from coming to me, for the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to such ones.\" 15 And he placed his hands on them and departed from there.\n16 Now look! someone came up to him and said: \"Teacher, what good must I do to gain everlasting life?\" 17 He said to him: \"Why do you ask me about what is good? One there is who is good. If, though, you want to enter into life, observe the commandments continually.\" 18 He said to him: \"Which ones?\" Jesus said: \"You must not murder, you must not commit adultery, you must not steal, you must not bear false witness, 19 honor your father and your mother, and you must love your neighbor as yourself.\" 20 The young man said to him: \"I have kept all of these; what am I still lacking?\" 21 Jesus said to him: \"If you want to be perfect, go sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.\" 22 When the young man heard this, he went away grieved, for he had many possessions. 23 Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of the heavens. 24 Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.\"\n25 When the disciples heard that, they were greatly astounded, saying: \"Who really can be saved?\" 26 Looking at them intently, Jesus said to them: \"With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\"\n27 Then Peter said in reply: \"Look! We have left all things and followed you; what, then, will there be for us?\" 28 Jesus said to them: \"Truly I say to you, in the re-creation, when the Son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life.\n30 \"But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\nChapter 20\n1 \"For the Kingdom of the heavens is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. 2 After he had agreed with the workers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace; 4 and to those he said, 'You too go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is fair.' 5 So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise. 6 Finally, about the 11th hour, he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day unemployed?' 7 They replied, 'Because nobody has hired us.' He said to them, 'You too go into the vineyard.'\n8 \"When evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last and ending with the first.' 9 When the 11th-hour men came, they each received a denarius. 10 So when the first came, they assumed that they would receive more, but they too were paid at the rate of a denarius. 11 On receiving it, they began to complain against the master of the house 12 and said, 'These last men put in one hour's work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!' 13 But he said in reply to one of them, 'Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a denarius, did you not? 14 Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you. 15 Do I not have the right to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye envious because I am good?' 16 In this way, the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.\"\n17 While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road: 18 \"Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death 19 and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake; and on the third day he will be raised up.\"\n20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him. 21 He said to her: \"What do you want?\" She replied to him: \"Give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your Kingdom.\" 22 Jesus answered: \"You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?\" They said to him: \"We can.\" 23 He said to them: \"You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.\"\n24 When the ten others heard about it, they became indignant at the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them to him and said: \"You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them. 26 This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister, 27 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. 28 Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.\"\n29 As they were going out of Jericho, a large crowd followed him. 30 And look! two blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out: \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" 31 But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to keep silent; yet they cried all the louder, saying: \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" 32 So Jesus stopped, called them, and said: \"What do you want me to do for you?\" 33 They said to him: \"Lord, let our eyes be opened.\" 34 Moved with pity, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and they followed him.\nChapter 21\n1 When they got close to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them: \"Go into the village that is within sight, and you will at once find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. 3 If someone says anything to you, you must say, 'The Lord needs them.' At that he will immediately send them.\"\n4 This actually took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, who said: 5 \"Tell the daughter of Zion: 'Look! Your king is coming to you, mild-tempered and mounted on a donkey, yes, on a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.'\"\n6 So the disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them. 7 They brought the donkey and its colt, and they put their outer garments on them, and he sat on them. 8 Most of the crowd spread their outer garments on the road, while others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. 9 Moreover, the crowds going ahead of him and those following him kept shouting: \"Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!\"\n10 And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, saying: \"Who is this?\" 11 The crowds kept saying: \"This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee!\"\n12 Jesus entered the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. 13 And he said to them: \"It is written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a cave of robbers.\" 14 Also, blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he cured them.\n15 When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys who were shouting in the temple, \"Save, we pray, the Son of David!\" they became indignant 16 and said to him: \"Do you hear what these are saying?\" Jesus said to them: \"Yes. Did you never read this, 'Out of the mouth of children and infants, you have brought forth praise'?\" 17 And leaving them behind, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.\n18 While returning to the city early in the morning, he felt hungry. 19 He caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves, and he said to it: \"Let no fruit come from you ever again.\" And the fig tree withered instantly. 20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said: \"How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?\" 21 In answer Jesus said to them: \"Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. 22 And all the things you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive.\"\n23 After he went into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching and said: \"By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?\" 24 In reply Jesus said to them: \"I will also ask you one thing. If you tell me, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things: 25 The baptism by John, from what source was it? From heaven or from men?\" But they began to reason among themselves, saying: \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why, then, did you not believe him?' 26 But if we say, 'From men,' we have the crowd to fear, for they all regard John as a prophet.\" 27 So they answered Jesus: \"We do not know.\" He, in turn, said to them: \"Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.\n28 \"What do you think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said, 'Child, go work today in the vineyard.' 29 In answer this one said, 'I will not,' but afterward, he felt regret and went out. 30 Approaching the second, he said the same. This one replied, 'I will, Sir,' but did not go out. 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?\" They said: \"The first.\" Jesus said to them: \"Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the Kingdom of God. 32 For John came to you in a way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even when you saw this, you did not feel regret afterward so as to believe him.\n33 \"Hear another illustration: There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower; then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad. 34 When the fruit season came around, he sent his slaves to the cultivators to collect his fruit. 35 However, the cultivators took his slaves, and they beat one up, another they killed, another they stoned. 36 Again he sent other slaves, more than the first group, but they did the same to these. 37 Lastly he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' 38 On seeing the son, the cultivators said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!' 39 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?\" 41 They said to him: \"Because they are evil, he will bring a terrible destruction on them and will lease the vineyard to other cultivators, who will give him the fruits when they become due.\"\n42 Jesus said to them: \"Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone. This has come from Jehovah, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? 43 This is why I say to you, the Kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits. 44 Also, the person falling on this stone will be shattered. As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.\"\n45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations, they knew that he was speaking about them. 46 Although they wanted to seize him, they feared the crowds, because these regarded him as a prophet.\nChapter 22\n1 Once more Jesus spoke to them with illustrations, saying: 2 \"The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who made a marriage feast for his son. 3 And he sent his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come. 4 Again he sent other slaves, saying, 'Tell those invited: \"Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage feast.\"' 5 But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his business; 6 but the rest, seizing his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them.\n7 \"The king grew wrathful and sent his armies and killed those murderers and burned their city. 8 Then he said to his slaves, 'The marriage feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. 9 Therefore, go to the roads leading out of the city, and invite anyone you find to the marriage feast.' 10 Accordingly, those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those dining.\n11 \"When the king came in to inspect the guests, he caught sight of a man not wearing a marriage garment. 12 So he said to him, 'Fellow, how did you get in here without a marriage garment?' He was speechless. 13 Then the king said to his servants, 'Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.'\n14 \"For there are many invited, but few chosen.\"\n15 Then the Pharisees went and conspired together in order to trap him in his speech. 16 So they sent their disciples to him, together with party followers of Herod, saying: \"Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not seek anyone's favor, for you do not look at the outward appearance of people. 17 Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?\" 18 But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: \"Why do you put me to the test, hypocrites? 19 Show me the tax coin.\" They brought him a denarius. 20 He said to them: \"Whose image and inscription is this?\" 21 They said: \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them: \"Pay back, therefore, Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.\" 22 When they heard that, they were amazed, and they left him and went away.\n23 On that day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came and asked him: 24 \"Teacher, Moses said: 'If any man dies without having children, his brother must marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.' 25 Now there were seven brothers with us. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his wife for his brother. 26 The same thing happened with the second and the third, through all seven. 27 Last of all, the woman died. 28 So in the resurrection, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her as a wife.\"\n29 In reply Jesus said to them: \"You are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God; 30 for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are as angels in heaven. 31 Regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said: 32 'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.\" 33 On hearing that, the crowds were astounded at his teaching.\n34 After the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together in one group. 35 And one of them, versed in the Law, tested him by asking: 36 \"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\" 37 He said to him: \"'You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.' 38 This is the greatest and first commandment. 39 The second, like it, is this: 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.\"\n41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them: 42 \"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?\" They said to him: \"David's.\" 43 He asked them: \"How is it, then, that David under inspiration calls him Lord, saying, 44 'Jehovah said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet\"'? 45 If, then, David calls him Lord, how is he his son?\" 46 And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him, and from that day on, no one dared to question him any further.\nChapter 23\n1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying: 2 \"The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses. 3 Therefore, all the things they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but they do not practice what they say. 4 They bind up heavy loads and put them on the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger. 5 All the works they do, they do to be seen by men, for they broaden the scripture-containing cases that they wear as safeguards and lengthen the fringes of their garments. 6 They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues 7 and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men. 8 But you, do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your Teacher, and all of you are brothers. 9 Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One. 10 Neither be called leaders, for your Leader is one, the Christ. 11 But the greatest one among you must be your minister. 12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n13 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut up the Kingdom of the heavens before men; for you yourselves do not go in, neither do you permit those on their way in to go in. 14 --\n15 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you travel over sea and dry land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him a subject for Gehenna twice as much so as yourselves.\n16 \"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is under obligation.' 17 Fools and blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold? 18 Moreover, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is under obligation.' 19 Blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? 20 Therefore, whoever swears by the altar is swearing by it and by all the things on it; 21 and whoever swears by the temple is swearing by it and by the One inhabiting it; 22 and whoever swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and by the One sitting on it.\n23 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These things it was necessary to do, yet not to disregard the other things. 24 Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel!\n25 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of greediness and self-indulgence. 26 Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may also become clean.\n27 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men's bones and of every sort of uncleanness. 28 In the same way, on the outside you appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.\n29 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the graves of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous ones, 30 and you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have shared with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' 31 Therefore, you are testifying against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32 Well, then, fill up the measure of your forefathers.\n33 \"Serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you flee from the judgment of Gehenna? 34 For this reason, I am sending to you prophets and wise men and public instructors. Some of them you will kill and execute on stakes, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, 35 so that there may come upon you all the righteous blood spilled on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. 36 Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n37 \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to her-how often I wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you did not want it. 38 Look! Your house is abandoned to you. 39 For I say to you, you will by no means see me from now until you say, 'Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name!'\"\nChapter 24\n1 Now as Jesus was departing from the temple, his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple. 2 In response he said to them: \"Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.\"\n3 While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: \"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?\"\n4 In answer Jesus said to them: \"Look out that nobody misleads you, 5 for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many. 6 You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for these things must take place, but the end is not yet.\n7 \"For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. 8 All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.\n9 \"Then people will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name. 10 Then, too, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another. 11 Many false prophets will arise and mislead many; 12 and because of the increasing of lawlessness, the love of the greater number will grow cold. 13 But the one who has endured to the end will be saved. 14 And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.\n15 \"Therefore, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation, as spoken about by Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place (let the reader use discernment), 16 then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains. 17 Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house, 18 and let the man in the field not return to pick up his outer garment. 19 Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days! 20 Keep praying that your flight may not occur in wintertime nor on the Sabbath day; 21 for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world's beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. 22 In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.\n23 \"Then if anyone says to you, 'Look! Here is the Christ,' or, 'There!' do not believe it. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones. 25 Look! I have forewarned you. 26 Therefore, if people say to you, 'Look! He is in the wilderness,' do not go out; 'Look! He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. 27 For just as the lightning comes out of the east and shines over to the west, so the presence of the Son of man will be. 28 Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.\n29 \"Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And he will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity.\n32 \"Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 Likewise also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors. 34 Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.\n36 \"Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. 38 For as they were in those days before the Flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, 39 and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be. 40 Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken along and the other abandoned. 41 Two women will be grinding at the hand mill; one will be taken along and the other abandoned. 42 Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.\n43 \"But know one thing: If the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into. 44 On this account, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.\n45 \"Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? 46 Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so! 47 Truly I say to you, he will appoint him over all his belongings.\n48 \"But if ever that evil slave says in his heart, 'My master is delaying,' 49 and he starts to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards, 50 the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour that he does not know, 51 and he will punish him with the greatest severity and will assign him his place with the hypocrites. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.\nChapter 25\n1 \"Then the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet. 3 For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them, 4 whereas the discreet took oil in their flasks along with their lamps. 5 While the bridegroom was delaying, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 6 Right in the middle of the night there was a shout: 'Here is the bridegroom! Go out to meet him.' 7 Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order. 8 The foolish said to the discreet, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out.' 9 The discreet answered, saying: 'Perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy some for yourselves.' 10 While they were going off to buy it, the bridegroom came. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 11 Afterward, the rest of the virgins also came, saying, 'Sir, Sir, open to us!' 12 In answer he said, 'I tell you the truth, I do not know you.'\n13 \"Keep on the watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.\n14 \"For it is just like a man about to travel abroad who summoned his slaves and entrusted his belongings to them. 15 He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to still another, to each according to his own ability, and he went abroad. 16 Immediately the one who received the five talents went and did business with them and gained five more. 17 Likewise, the one who received the two gained two more. 18 But the slave who received just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.\n19 \"After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them. 20 So the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.' 21 His master said to him: 'Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.' 22 Next the one who had received the two talents came forward and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me; see, I gained two talents more.' 23 His master said to him: 'Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'\n24 \"Finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said: 'Master, I knew you to be a demanding man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow. 25 So I grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.' 26 In reply his master said to him: 'Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow? 27 Well, then, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my coming I would have received it back with interest.\n28 \"'Therefore, take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. 29 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 30 And throw the good-for-nothing slave out into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.'\n31 \"When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.\n34 \"Then the King will say to those on his right: 'Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world. 35 For I became hungry and you gave me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you received me hospitably; 36 naked and you clothed me. I fell sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you visited me.' 37 Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' 40 In reply the King will say to them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'\n41 \"Then he will say to those on his left: 'Go away from me, you who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels. 42 For I became hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat; and I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink. 43 I was a stranger, but you did not receive me hospitably; naked, but you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but you did not look after me.' 44 Then they too will answer with the words: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you?' 45 Then he will answer them, saying: 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones, you did not do it to me.' 46 These will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.\"\nChapter 26\n1 Now when Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples: 2 \"You know that two days from now the Passover takes place, and the Son of man will be handed over to be executed on the stake.\"\n3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas, 4 and they conspired together to seize Jesus by cunning and to kill him. 5 However, they were saying: \"Not at the festival, so that there may not be an uproar among the people.\"\n6 While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 7 a woman with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil approached him, and she began pouring it on his head as he was dining. 8 On seeing this, the disciples became indignant and said: \"Why this waste? 9 For this could have been sold for a great deal of money and given to the poor.\" 10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them: \"Why do you try to make trouble for the woman? She did a fine deed toward me. 11 For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. 12 When she put this perfumed oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. 13 Truly I say to you, wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did will also be told in memory of her.\"\n14 Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said: \"What will you give me to betray him to you?\" They stipulated to him 30 silver pieces. 16 So from then on, he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him.\n17 On the first day of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: \"Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?\" 18 He said: \"Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, 'The Teacher says: \"My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.\"'\" 19 So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover.\n20 When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples. 21 While they were eating, he said: \"Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.\" 22 Being very much grieved at this, each and every one began to say to him: \"Lord, it is not I, is it?\" 23 In reply he said: \"The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl is the one who will betray me. 24 True, the Son of man is going away, just as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" 25 Judas, who was about to betray him, replied: \"It is not I, is it, Rabbi?\" Jesus said to him: \"You yourself said it.\"\n26 As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf, and after saying a blessing, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said: \"Take, eat. This means my body.\" 27 And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, saying: \"Drink out of it, all of you, 28 for this means my 'blood of the covenant,' which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins. 29 But I say to you: I will by no means drink again any of this product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.\" 30 Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n31 Then Jesus said to them: \"All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.' 32 But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" 33 But Peter, in response, said to him: \"Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, I will never be stumbled!\" 34 Jesus said to him: \"Truly I say to you, on this night, before a rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" 35 Peter said to him: \"Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.\" All the other disciples also said the same thing.\n36 Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples: \"Sit down here while I go over there and pray.\" 37 And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled. 38 Then he said to them: \"I am deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep on the watch with me.\" 39 And going a little way forward, he fell facedown, praying: \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.\"\n40 He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: \"Could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me? 41 Keep on the watch and pray continually, so that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.\" 42 Again, a second time, he went off and prayed: \"My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away unless I drink it, let your will take place.\" 43 And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 44 So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for a third time, saying once more the same thing. 45 Then he returned to the disciples and said to them: \"At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting! Look! The hour has drawn near for the Son of man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer has drawn near.\" 47 While he was still speaking, look! Judas, one of the Twelve, came and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.\n48 Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying: \"Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one; take him into custody.\" 49 And going straight up to Jesus, he said: \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" and gave him a tender kiss. 50 But Jesus said to him: \"Fellow, for what purpose are you present?\" Then they came forward and seized Jesus and took him into custody. 51 But look! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him: \"Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than 12 legions of angels? 54 In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way?\" 55 In that hour Jesus said to the crowds: \"Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber? Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and yet you did not take me into custody. 56 But all of this has taken place for the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.\n57 Those who took Jesus into custody led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. 58 But Peter kept following him from a good distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and after going inside, he sat with the house attendants to see the outcome.\n59 Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death. 60 But they found none, although many false witnesses came forward. Later two came forward 61 and said: \"This man said, 'I am able to throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days.'\" 62 With that the high priest stood up and said to him: \"Do you say nothing in reply? What is it these men are testifying against you?\" 63 But Jesus kept silent. So the high priest said to him: \"I put you under oath by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God!\" 64 Jesus said to him: \"You yourself said it. But I say to you: From now on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" 65 Then the high priest ripped his outer garments, saying: \"He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? See! Now you have heard the blasphemy. 66 What is your opinion?\" They answered: \"He deserves to die.\" 67 Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists. Others slapped him on the face, 68 saying: \"Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who struck you?\"\n69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him and said: \"You too were with Jesus the Galilean!\" 70 But he denied it before them all, saying: \"I do not know what you are talking about.\" 71 When he went out to the gatehouse, another girl noticed him and said to those there: \"This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.\" 72 Again he denied it, with an oath: \"I do not know the man!\" 73 After a little while, those standing around came up and said to Peter: \"Certainly you are also one of them, for in fact, your dialect gives you away.\" 74 Then he started to curse and swear: \"I do not know the man!\" And immediately a rooster crowed. 75 And Peter called to mind what Jesus had said, namely: \"Before a rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.\nChapter 27\n1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death. 2 After binding him, they led him off and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.\n3 Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, felt remorse and brought the 30 pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders, 4 saying: \"I sinned when I betrayed innocent blood.\" They said: \"What is that to us? You must see to it!\" 5 So he threw the silver pieces into the temple and departed. Then he went off and hanged himself. 6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: \"It is not lawful to put them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.\" 7 After consulting together, they used the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. 8 Therefore, that field has been called Field of Blood to this very day. 9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"And they took the 30 silver pieces, the price that was set on the man, the one on whom a price was set by some of the sons of Israel, 10 and they gave them for the potter's field, according to what Jehovah had commanded me.\"\n11 Jesus now stood before the governor, and the governor put the question to him: \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus replied: \"You yourself say it.\" 12 But while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. 13 Then Pilate said to him: \"Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?\" 14 But he did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor was very surprised.\n15 Now from festival to festival, it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted. 16 Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. 17 So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them: \"Which one do you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus the so-called Christ?\" 18 For Pilate was aware that out of envy they had handed him over. 19 Moreover, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying: \"Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I suffered a lot today in a dream because of him.\" 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, but to have Jesus put to death. 21 In response the governor said to them: \"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" They said: \"Barabbas.\" 22 Pilate said to them: \"What, then, should I do with Jesus the so-called Christ?\" They all said: \"To the stake with him!\" 23 He said: \"Why? What bad thing did he do?\" Still they kept shouting out all the more: \"To the stake with him!\"\n24 Seeing that it did no good but, rather, an uproar was arising, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: \"I am innocent of the blood of this man. You yourselves must see to it.\" 25 At that all the people said in answer: \"Let his blood come upon us and upon our children.\" 26 Then he released Barabbas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed him over to be executed on the stake.\n27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's residence and gathered the whole body of troops together around him. 28 And disrobing him, they draped him with a scarlet cloak, 29 and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying: \"Greetings, you King of the Jews!\" 30 And they spat on him and took the reed and began hitting him on his head. 31 Finally, after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak and put his outer garments on him and led him off to be nailed to the stake.\n32 As they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon. This man they compelled into service to carry his torture stake. 33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha, that is, Skull Place, 34 they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. 35 When they had nailed him to the stake, they distributed his outer garments by casting lots, 36 and they sat there keeping watch over him. 37 They also posted above his head the charge against him, in writing: \"This is Jesus the King of the Jews.\"\n38 Then two robbers were put on stakes alongside him, one on his right and one on his left. 39 And those passing by spoke abusively of him, shaking their heads 40 and saying: \"You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!\" 41 In the same way also, the chief priests with the scribes and the elders began mocking him, saying: 42 \"Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake, and we will believe in him. 43 He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, 'I am God's Son.'\" 44 In the same way, even the robbers who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him.\n45 From the sixth hour on, a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour. 46 About the ninth hour, Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\" that is, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" 47 At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: \"This man is calling Elijah.\" 48 And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it in sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. 49 But the rest of them said: \"Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.\" 50 Again Jesus called out with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.\n51 And look! the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split. 52 And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised up 53 (and people coming out from among the tombs after his being raised up entered into the holy city), and they became visible to many people. 54 But when the army officer and those with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and the things happening, they grew very much afraid and said: \"Certainly this was God's Son.\"\n55 And many women were there watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee to minister to him; 56 among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\n57 Now as it was late in the afternoon, a rich man of Arimathea came, named Joseph, who had also become a disciple of Jesus. 58 This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him. 59 Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean, fine linen, 60 and laid it in his new tomb, which he had quarried in the rock. And after rolling a big stone to the entrance of the tomb, he left. 61 But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary continued there, sitting before the grave.\n62 The next day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate, 63 saying: \"Sir, we recall what that impostor said while he was still alive, 'After three days I am to be raised up.' 64 Therefore, command that the grave be made secure until the third day, so that his disciples may not come and steal him and say to the people, 'He was raised up from the dead!' Then this last deception will be worse than the first.\" 65 Pilate said to them: \"You may have a guard. Go make it as secure as you know how.\" 66 So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone and posting a guard.\nChapter 28\n1 After the Sabbath, when it was growing light on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the grave.\n2 And look! a great earthquake had taken place, for Jehovah's angel had descended from heaven and had come and rolled away the stone, and he was sitting on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow. 4 Yes, out of their fear of him, the watchmen trembled and became as dead men.\n5 But the angel said to the women: \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was executed on the stake. 6 He is not here, for he was raised up, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised up from the dead, for look! he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there. Look! I have told you.\"\n8 So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples. 9 And look! Jesus met them and said: \"Good day!\" They approached and took hold of his feet and did obeisance to him. 10 Then Jesus said to them: \"Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers so that they may go to Galilee, and there they will see me.\"\n11 While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. 12 And after these had gathered with the elders and had consulted together, they gave a considerable number of silver pieces to the soldiers 13 and said: \"Say, 'His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.' 14 And if this gets to the governor's ears, we will explain the matter to him and you will not need to worry.\" 15 So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed, and this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.\n16 However, the 11 disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them to meet. 17 When they saw him, they did obeisance, but some doubted. 18 Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: \"All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. 19 Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.\"\n",

    "text": "John\nChapter 1\n1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god. 2 This one was in the beginning with God. 3 All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.\nWhat has come into existence 4 by means of him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light is shining in the darkness, but the darkness has not overpowered it.\n6 There came a man who was sent as a representative of God; his name was John. 7 This man came as a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, so that people of all sorts might believe through him. 8 He was not that light, but he was meant to bear witness about that light.\n9 The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, but the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own home, but his own people did not accept him. 12 However, to all who did receive him, he gave authority to become God's children, because they were exercising faith in his name. 13 And they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man's will, but from God.\n14 So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of divine favor and truth. 15 (John bore witness about him, yes, he cried out: \"This was the one of whom I said, 'The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, for he existed before me.'\") 16 For we all received from his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness. 17 Because the Law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ. 18 No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is at the Father's side is the one who has explained Him.\n19 This is the witness John gave when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: \"Who are you?\" 20 And he admitted it and did not deny it, saying: \"I am not the Christ.\" 21 And they asked him: \"What, then? Are you Elijah?\" He replied: \"I am not.\" \"Are you the Prophet?\" And he answered: \"No!\" 22 So they said to him: \"Who are you? Tell us so that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" 23 He said: \"I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, 'Make the way of Jehovah straight,' just as Isaiah the prophet said.\" 24 Now those sent were from the Pharisees. 25 So they questioned him and said to him: \"Why, then, do you baptize if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?\" 26 John answered them: \"I baptize in water. One is standing among you whom you do not know, 27 the one coming behind me, the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.\" 28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and he said: \"See, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! 30 This is the one about whom I said: 'Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, for he existed before me.' 31 Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was so that he might be made manifest to Israel.\" 32 John also bore witness, saying: \"I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him. 33 Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me to baptize in water said to me: 'Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one who baptizes in holy spirit.' 34 And I have seen it, and I have given witness that this one is the Son of God.\"\n35 Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and as he looked at Jesus walking, he said: \"See, the Lamb of God!\" 37 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, he said to them: \"What are you looking for?\" They said to him: \"Rabbi (which means, when translated, \"Teacher\"), where are you staying?\" 39 He said to them: \"Come, and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour. 40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus. 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him: \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means, when translated, \"Christ\"), 42 and he led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked at him, he said: \"You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas\" (which is translated \"Peter\").\n43 The next day he wanted to leave for Galilee. Jesus then found Philip and said to him: \"Be my follower.\" 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him: \"We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote: Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.\" 46 But Nathanael said to him: \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said to him: \"Come and see.\" 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him: \"See, truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.\" 48 Nathanael said to him: \"How do you know me?\" Jesus answered him: \"Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\" 49 Nathanael responded: \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.\" 50 Jesus answered him: \"Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see things greater than these.\" 51 He then said to him: \"Most truly I say to you men, you will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.\"\nChapter 2\n1 And on the third day a marriage feast took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2 Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast.\n3 When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him: \"They have no wine.\" 4 But Jesus said to her: \"Woman, why is that of concern to me and to you? My hour has not yet come.\" 5 His mother said to those serving: \"Do whatever he tells you.\" 6 Now there were six stone water jars sitting there as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures. 7 Jesus said to them: \"Fill the jars with water.\" So they filled them to the brim. 8 Then he said to them: \"Now draw some out and take it to the director of the feast.\" So they took it. 9 When the director of the feast tasted the water that had now been turned into wine, not knowing where it came from (although the servants who had drawn out the water knew), the director of the feast called the bridegroom 10 and said to him: \"Everyone else puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have saved the fine wine until now.\" 11 Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest, and his disciples put their faith in him.\n12 After this he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum, but they did not stay there many days.\n13 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 He found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money brokers in their seats. 15 So after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 16 And he said to those selling the doves: \"Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of commerce!\" 17 His disciples recalled that it is written: \"The zeal for your house will consume me.\"\n18 Therefore, in response the Jews said to him: \"What sign can you show us, since you are doing these things?\" 19 Jesus replied to them: \"Tear down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" 20 The Jews then said: \"This temple was built in 46 years, and will you raise it up in three days?\" 21 But he was talking about the temple of his body. 22 When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples recalled that he used to say this, and they believed the scripture and what Jesus had spoken.\n23 However, when he was in Jerusalem at the festival of the Passover, many people put their faith in his name when they saw the signs that he was performing. 24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them because he knew them all 25 and because he did not need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he knew what was in man.\nChapter 3\n1 There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 This one came to him in the night and said to him: \"Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.\" 3 In response Jesus said to him: \"Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.\" 4 Nicodemus said to him: \"How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?\" 5 Jesus answered: \"Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. 6 What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit. 7 Do not be amazed because I told you: You people must be born again. 8 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit.\"\n9 In answer Nicodemus said to him: \"How can these things be?\" 10 Jesus replied: \"Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not know these things? 11 Most truly I say to you, what we know we speak, and what we have seen we bear witness to, but you do not receive the witness we give. 12 If I have told you earthly things and you still do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13 Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but the one who descended from heaven, the Son of man. 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up, 15 so that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.\n16 \"For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world for him to judge the world, but for the world to be saved through him. 18 Whoever exercises faith in him is not to be judged. Whoever does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. 19 Now this is the basis for judgment: that the light has come into the world, but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked. 20 For whoever practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be reproved. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that his works may be made manifest as having been done in harmony with God.\"\n22 After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and there he spent some time with them and was baptizing. 23 But John too was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was a great quantity of water there, and people kept coming and were being baptized; 24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.\n25 Now the disciples of John had a dispute with a Jew concerning purification. 26 So they came to John and said to him: \"Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan, about whom you bore witness, see, this one is baptizing, and all are going to him.\" 27 In answer John said: \"A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven. 28 You yourselves bear me witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of that one.' 29 Whoever has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom. So my joy has been made complete. 30 That one must keep on increasing, but I must keep on decreasing.\"\n31 The one who comes from above is over all others. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks of things of the earth. The one who comes from heaven is over all others. 32 He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, but no man accepts his witness. 33 Whoever has accepted his witness has put his seal to it that God is true. 34 For the one whom God sent speaks the sayings of God, for He does not give the spirit sparingly. 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.\nChapter 4\n1 When the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John- 2 although Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did- 3 he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. 4 But it was necessary for him to go through Samaria. 5 So he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6 In fact, Jacob's well was there. Now Jesus, tired out as he was from the journey, was sitting at the well. It was about the sixth hour.\n7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: \"Give me a drink.\" 8 (For his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food.) 9 So the Samaritan woman said to him: \"How is it that you, despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink even though I am a Samaritan woman?\" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) 10 In answer Jesus said to her: \"If you had known of the free gift of God and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.\" 11 She said to him: \"Sir, you do not even have a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, then, do you have this living water? 12 You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who together with his sons and his cattle drank out of it, are you?\" 13 In answer Jesus said to her: \"Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again. 14 Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.\" 15 The woman said to him: \"Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.\"\n16 He said to her: \"Go, call your husband and come to this place.\" 17 The woman replied: \"I do not have a husband.\" Jesus said to her: \"You are right in saying, 'I do not have a husband.' 18 For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.\" 19 The woman said to him: \"Sir, I see that you are a prophet. 20 Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.\" 21 Jesus said to her: \"Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 22 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation begins with the Jews. 23 Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him. 24 God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.\" 25 The woman said to him: \"I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever that one comes, he will declare all things to us openly.\" 26 Jesus said to her: \"I am he, the one speaking to you.\"\n27 Just then his disciples arrived, and they were surprised because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: \"What are you looking for?\" or \"Why are you talking to her?\" 28 So the woman left her water jar and went off into the city and told the people: 29 \"Come and see a man who told me everything I did. Could this not perhaps be the Christ?\" 30 They left the city and began coming to him.\n31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him: \"Rabbi, eat.\" 32 But he said to them: \"I have food to eat that you do not know about.\" 33 So the disciples said to one another: \"No one brought him anything to eat, did he?\" 34 Jesus said to them: \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. 35 Do you not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to you: Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already 36 the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. 37 For in this respect the saying is true: One is the sower and another the reaper. 38 I sent you to reap what you did not labor on. Others have labored, and you have entered into the benefit of their labor.\"\n39 Many of the Samaritans from that city put faith in him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, saying: \"He told me all the things I did.\" 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. 41 As a result, many more believed because of what he said, 42 and they said to the woman: \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the savior of the world.\"\n43 After the two days, he left there for Galilee. 44 Jesus himself, however, bore witness that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland. 45 So when he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too had gone to the festival.\n46 Then he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum. 47 When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying. 48 But Jesus said to him: \"Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.\" 49 The royal official said to him: \"Lord, come down before my young child dies.\" 50 Jesus said to him: \"Go your way; your son lives.\" The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he left. 51 But while he was on his way down, his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive. 52 So he asked them at what hour he got better. They replied to him: \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" 53 The father then knew that it was in the very hour that Jesus had said to him: \"Your son lives.\" So he and his whole household believed. 54 This was the second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee.\nChapter 5\n1 After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2 Now in Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate is a pool called in Hebrew Bethzatha, with five colonnades. 3 Within these a multitude of the sick, blind, lame, and those with withered limbs were lying down. 4 -- 5 But one man was there who had been sick for 38 years. 6 Seeing this man lying there and being aware that he had already been sick for a long time, Jesus said to him: \"Do you want to get well?\" 7 The sick man answered him: \"Sir, I do not have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am on my way, another steps down ahead of me.\" 8 Jesus said to him: \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\" 9 And the man immediately got well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk.\nThat day was the Sabbath. 10 So the Jews began to say to the cured man: \"It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry the mat.\" 11 But he answered them: \"The same one who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\" 12 They asked him: \"Who is the man who told you, 'Pick it up and walk'?\" 13 But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.\n14 After this Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: \"See, you have become well. Do not sin anymore, so that something worse does not happen to you.\" 15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. 16 For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during the Sabbath. 17 But he answered them: \"My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.\" 18 This is why the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.\n19 Therefore, in response Jesus said to them: \"Most truly I say to you, the Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son does also in like manner. 20 For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does, and he will show him works greater than these, so that you may marvel. 21 For just as the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes alive whomever he wants to. 22 For the Father judges no one at all, but he has entrusted all the judging to the Son, 23 so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. 24 Most truly I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes the One who sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.\n25 \"Most truly I say to you, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have paid attention will live. 26 For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself. 27 And he has given him authority to do judging, because he is the Son of man. 28 Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice 29 and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, and those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment. 30 I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I seek, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.\n31 \"If I alone bear witness about myself, my witness is not true. 32 There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the witness he bears about me is true. 33 You have sent men to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. 34 However, I do not accept the witness from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. 35 That man was a burning and shining lamp, and for a short time you were willing to rejoice greatly in his light. 36 But I have the witness greater than that of John, for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish, these works that I am doing, bear witness that the Father sent me. 37 And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form, 38 and you do not have his word residing in you, because you do not believe the very one whom he sent.\n39 \"You are searching the Scriptures because you think that you will have everlasting life by means of them; and these are the very ones that bear witness about me. 40 And yet you do not want to come to me so that you may have life. 41 I do not accept glory from men, 42 but I well know that you do not have the love of God in you. 43 I have come in the name of my Father, but you do not receive me. If someone else came in his own name, you would receive that one. 44 How can you believe, when you are accepting glory from one another and you are not seeking the glory that is from the only God? 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you have put your hope. 46 In fact, if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe what I say?\"\nChapter 6\n1 After this Jesus set out across the Sea of Galilee, or Tiberias. 2 And a large crowd kept following him, because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing in healing the sick. 3 So Jesus went up on a mountain and sat down there with his disciples. 4 Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near. 5 When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip: \"Where will we buy bread for these people to eat?\" 6 However, he was saying this to test him, for he knew what he was about to do. 7 Philip answered him: \"Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get even a little.\" 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him: 9 \"Here is a little boy who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many?\"\n10 Jesus said: \"Have the people sit down.\" As there was a lot of grass in that place, the men sat down there, about 5,000 in number. 11 Jesus took the bread, and after giving thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting there; he did likewise with the small fish, and they had as much as they wanted. 12 But when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples: \"Gather together the fragments left over, so that nothing is wasted.\" 13 So they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves.\n14 When the people saw the sign he performed, they began to say: \"This really is the Prophet who was to come into the world.\" 15 Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain all alone.\n16 When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea, 17 and boarding a boat, they set out across the sea for Capernaum. By now it had grown dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 18 Also, the sea was getting rough because a strong wind was blowing. 19 However, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and getting near the boat, and they became fearful. 20 But he said to them: \"It is I; do not be afraid!\" 21 Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and right away the boat arrived at the land to which they had been heading.\n22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there was no boat there. A small one had been there, but Jesus had not boarded that boat with his disciples, for his disciples had left by themselves. 23 Boats from Tiberias, however, arrived near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 24 So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they boarded their boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus.\n25 When they found him across the sea, they said to him: \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" 26 Jesus answered them: \"Most truly I say to you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied. 27 Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you; for on this one the Father, God himself, has put his seal of approval.\"\n28 So they said to him: \"What must we do to carry out the works of God?\" 29 In answer Jesus said to them: \"This is the work of God, that you exercise faith in the one whom he sent.\" 30 Then they said to him: \"What are you performing as a sign, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you doing? 31 Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" 32 Jesus then said to them: \"Most truly I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" 34 So they said to him: \"Lord, always give us this bread.\"\n35 Jesus said to them: \"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not get hungry at all, and whoever exercises faith in me will never get thirsty at all. 36 But as I said to you, you have even seen me and yet do not believe. 37 All those whom the Father gives me will come to me, and I will never drive away the one who comes to me; 38 for I have come down from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me. 39 This is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none out of all those whom he has given me, but that I should resurrect them on the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day.\"\n41 Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he had said: \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" 42 And they began saying: \"Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?\" 43 In response Jesus said to them: \"Stop murmuring among yourselves. 44 No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him, and I will resurrect him on the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by Jehovah.' Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned comes to me. 46 Not that any man has seen the Father, except the one who is from God; this one has seen the Father. 47 Most truly I say to you, whoever believes has everlasting life.\n48 \"I am the bread of life. 49 Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness and yet they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and for a fact, the bread that I will give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.\"\n52 Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying: \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" 53 So Jesus said to them: \"Most truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves. 54 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day; 55 for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. It is not as when your forefathers ate and yet died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.\" 59 He said these things as he was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum.\n60 When they heard this, many of his disciples said: \"This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?\" 61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them: \"Does this stumble you? 62 What, therefore, if you should see the Son of man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that is life-giving; the flesh is of no use at all. The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus knew from the beginning those who did not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 He went on to say: \"This is why I have said to you, no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\"\n66 Because of this, many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him. 67 So Jesus said to the Twelve: \"You do not want to go also, do you?\" 68 Simon Peter answered him: \"Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life. 69 We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.\" 70 Jesus answered them: \"I chose you twelve, did I not? Yet one of you is a slanderer.\" 71 He was, in fact, speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for this one was going to betray him, although he was one of the Twelve.\nChapter 7\n1 After this Jesus continued traveling about in Galilee, for he did not want to do so in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill him. 2 However, the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near. 3 So his brothers said to him: \"Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples may also see the works you are doing. 4 For no one does anything in secret when he seeks to be known publicly. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.\" 5 His brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him. 6 So Jesus said to them: \"My time has not yet arrived, but your time is always at hand. 7 The world has no reason to hate you, but it hates me, because I bear witness about it that its works are wicked. 8 You go up to the festival; I am not yet going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come.\" 9 So after he told them these things, he remained in Galilee.\n10 But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not openly but in secret. 11 So the Jews began looking for him at the festival and saying: \"Where is that man?\" 12 And there was a lot of subdued talk about him among the crowds. Some would say: \"He is a good man.\" Others would say: \"He is not. He misleads the crowd.\" 13 Of course, no one would speak about him publicly because of fear of the Jews.\n14 When the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. 15 And the Jews were astonished, saying: \"How does this man have such a knowledge of the Scriptures when he has not studied at the schools?\" 16 Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: \"What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him who sent me. 17 If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or I speak of my own originality. 18 Whoever speaks of his own originality is seeking his own glory; but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him, this one is true and there is no unrighteousness in him. 19 Moses gave you the Law, did he not? But not one of you obeys the Law. Why are you seeking to kill me?\" 20 The crowd answered: \"You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?\" 21 In answer Jesus said to them: \"One deed I performed, and you are all surprised. 22 For this reason Moses has given you circumcision-not that it is from Moses, but it is from the forefathers-and you circumcise a man on a sabbath. 23 If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken, are you violently angry at me because I made a man completely well on a sabbath? 24 Stop judging by the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.\"\n25 Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say: \"This is the man they are seeking to kill, is it not? 26 And yet see! he is speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers come to know for certain that this is the Christ? 27 On the contrary, we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one is to know where he is from.\" 28 Then as he was teaching in the temple, Jesus called out: \"You know me and you know where I am from. And I have not come of my own initiative, but the One who sent me is real, and you do not know him. 29 I know him, because I am a representative from him, and that One sent me.\" 30 So they began seeking to get hold of him, but no one laid a hand on him, for his hour had not yet come. 31 Still, many of the crowd put faith in him, and they were saying: \"When the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?\"\n32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to seize him. 33 Jesus then said: \"I will be with you a little while longer before I go to the One who sent me. 34 You will look for me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.\" 35 Therefore, the Jews said among themselves: \"Where does this man intend to go, so that we will not find him? He does not intend to go to the Jews dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does he? 36 What does he mean when he says, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come'?\"\n37 On the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood up and he called out: \"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. 38 Whoever puts faith in me, just as the scripture has said: 'From deep within him streams of living water will flow.'\" 39 However, he said this concerning the spirit, which those who put faith in him were about to receive; for as yet there was no spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. 40 Some in the crowd who heard these words began saying: \"This really is the Prophet.\" 41 Others were saying: \"This is the Christ.\" But some were saying: \"The Christ is not coming out of Galilee, is he? 42 Does the scripture not say that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?\" 43 So a division over him arose among the crowd. 44 Some of them, though, wanted to seize him, but no one laid his hands on him.\n45 Then the officers went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and the latter said to them: \"Why did you not bring him in?\" 46 The officers replied: \"Never has any man spoken like this.\" 47 In turn the Pharisees answered: \"You have not been misled also, have you? 48 Not one of the rulers or of the Pharisees has put faith in him, has he? 49 But this crowd who do not know the Law are accursed people.\" 50 Nicodemus, who had come to him previously and who was one of them, said to them: 51 \"Our Law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing, does it?\" 52 In answer they said to him: \"You are not also out of Galilee, are you? Search and see that no prophet is to be raised up out of Galilee.\"\nChapter 8\n12 Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying: \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.\" 13 So the Pharisees said to him: \"You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true.\" 14 In answer Jesus said to them: \"Even if I do bear witness about myself, my witness is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from and where I am going. 15 You judge according to the flesh; I do not judge any man at all. 16 And yet even if I do judge, my judgment is truthful, because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. 17 Also, in your own Law it is written: 'The witness of two men is true.' 18 I am one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.\" 19 Then they said to him: \"Where is your Father?\" Jesus answered: \"You know neither me nor my Father. If you did know me, you would know my Father also.\" 20 He spoke these words in the treasury as he was teaching in the temple. But no one seized him, for his hour had not yet come.\n21 So he said to them again: \"I am going away, and you will look for me, and yet you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.\" 22 The Jews then began to say: \"He will not kill himself, will he? Because he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.'\" 23 He went on to say to them: \"You are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. You are from this world; I am not from this world. 24 That is why I said to you: You will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am the one, you will die in your sins.\" 25 So they began to say to him: \"Who are you?\" Jesus replied to them: \"Why am I even speaking to you at all? 26 I have many things to speak concerning you and to pass judgment on. As a matter of fact, the One who sent me is true, and the very things I heard from him I am speaking in the world.\" 27 They did not grasp that he was talking to them about the Father. 28 Jesus then said: \"After you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me, I speak these things. 29 And the One who sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.\" 30 As he was saying these things, many put faith in him.\n31 Then Jesus went on to say to the Jews who had believed him: \"If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" 33 They replied to him: \"We are Abraham's offspring and never have been slaves to anyone. How is it you say, 'You will become free'?\" 34 Jesus answered them: \"Most truly I say to you, every doer of sin is a slave of sin. 35 Moreover, the slave does not remain in the household forever; the son remains forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free. 37 I know that you are Abraham's offspring. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you. 38 I speak the things I have seen while with my Father, but you do the things you have heard from your father.\" 39 In answer they said to him: \"Our father is Abraham.\" Jesus said to them: \"If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works of Abraham. 40 But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. 41 You are doing the works of your father.\" They said to him: \"We were not born from immorality; we have one Father, God.\"\n42 Jesus said to them: \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I have not come of my own initiative, but that One sent me. 43 Why do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot listen to my word. 44 You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie. 45 Because I, on the other hand, tell you the truth, you do not believe me. 46 Who of you convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why is it that you do not believe me? 47 The one who is from God listens to the sayings of God. This is why you do not listen, because you are not from God.\"\n48 In answer the Jews said to him: \"Are we not right in saying, 'You are a Samaritan and have a demon'?\" 49 Jesus answered: \"I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. 50 But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One who is seeking and judging. 51 Most truly I say to you, if anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.\" 52 The Jews said to him: \"Now we do know that you have a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets, but you say, 'If anyone observes my word, he will never taste death at all.' 53 You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you claim to be?\" 54 Jesus answered: \"If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, the one who you say is your God. 55 Yet you have not known him, but I know him. And if I said I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar. But I do know him and am observing his word. 56 Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.\" 57 Then the Jews said to him: \"You are not yet 50 years old, and still you have seen Abraham?\" 58 Jesus said to them: \"Most truly I say to you, before Abraham came into existence, I have been.\" 59 So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid and went out of the temple.\nChapter 9\n1 As he was passing along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. 2 And his disciples asked him: \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?\" 3 Jesus answered: \"Neither this man sinned nor his parents, but it was so that the works of God might be made manifest in his case. 4 We must do the works of the One who sent me while it is day; the night is coming when no man can work. 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the world's light.\" 6 After he said these things, he spat on the ground and made a paste with the saliva, and he smeared the paste on the man's eyes 7 and said to him: \"Go wash in the pool of Siloam\" (which is translated \"Sent Forth\"). And he went and washed, and came back seeing.\n8 Then the neighbors and those who formerly used to see that he was a beggar began to say: \"This is the man who used to sit and beg, is it not?\" 9 Some were saying: \"This is he.\" Others were saying: \"No, but he looks like him.\" The man kept saying: \"I am he.\" 10 So they asked him: \"How, then, were your eyes opened?\" 11 He answered: \"The man called Jesus made a paste and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed and gained sight.\" 12 At this they said to him: \"Where is that man?\" He said: \"I do not know.\"\n13 They led the formerly blind man to the Pharisees. 14 Incidentally, the day that Jesus made the paste and opened his eyes was the Sabbath. 15 So this time the Pharisees also began asking the man how he gained sight. He said to them: \"He put a paste on my eyes, and I washed, and I can see.\" 16 Some of the Pharisees then began to say: \"This is not a man from God, for he does not observe the Sabbath.\" Others said: \"How can a man who is a sinner perform signs of that sort?\" So there was a division among them. 17 And again they said to the blind man: \"What do you say about him, since it was your eyes that he opened?\" The man said: \"He is a prophet.\"\n18 However, the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had gained sight, until they called the parents of the man who could now see. 19 And they asked them: \"Is this your son who you say was born blind? How, then, does he now see?\" 20 His parents answered: \"We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 21 But how it is that he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is of age. He must speak for himself.\" 22 His parents said these things because they were in fear of the Jews, for the Jews had already come to an agreement that if anyone acknowledged him as Christ, that person should be expelled from the synagogue. 23 This is why his parents said: \"He is of age. Question him.\"\n24 So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him: \"Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.\" 25 He answered: \"Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know, that I was blind, but now I can see.\" 26 Then they said to him: \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" 27 He answered them: \"I told you already, and yet you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples also, do you?\" 28 At this they scornfully told him: \"You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses. 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from.\" 30 The man answered them: \"This is certainly amazing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes. 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, he listens to this one. 32 From of old it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind. 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing at all.\" 34 In answer they said to him: \"You were altogether born in sin, and yet are you teaching us?\" And they threw him out!\n35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and on finding him, he said: \"Are you putting faith in the Son of man?\" 36 The man answered: \"And who is he, sir, so that I may put faith in him?\" 37 Jesus said to him: \"You have seen him, and in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\" 38 He said: \"I do put faith in him, Lord.\" And he did obeisance to him. 39 Jesus then said: \"For this judgment I came into this world, that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.\" 40 Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him: \"We are not blind also, are we?\" 41 Jesus said to them: \"If you were blind, you would have no sin. But now you say, 'We see.' Your sin remains.\"\nChapter 10\n1 \"Most truly I say to you, the one who does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs in by another way, that one is a thief and a plunderer. 2 But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 When he has brought all his own out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. 5 They will by no means follow a stranger but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.\" 6 Jesus spoke this comparison to them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.\n7 So Jesus said again: \"Most truly I say to you, I am the door for the sheep. 8 All those who have come in place of me are thieves and plunderers; but the sheep have not listened to them. 9 I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved, and that one will go in and out and find pasturage. 10 The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance. 11 I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his life in behalf of the sheep. 12 The hired man, who is not a shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees-and the wolf snatches them and scatters them- 13 because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep. 14 I am the fine shepherd. I know my sheep and my sheep know me, 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I surrender my life in behalf of the sheep.\n16 \"And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd. 17 This is why the Father loves me, because I surrender my life, so that I may receive it again. 18 No man takes it away from me, but I surrender it of my own initiative. I have authority to surrender it, and I have authority to receive it again. This commandment I received from my Father.\"\n19 A division again resulted among the Jews because of these words. 20 Many of them were saying: \"He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why do you listen to him?\" 21 Others said: \"These are not the sayings of a demonized man. A demon cannot open blind people's eyes, can it?\"\n22 At that time the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime, 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solomon. 24 Then the Jews surrounded him and began to say to him: \"How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\" 25 Jesus answered them: \"I told you, and yet you do not believe. The works that I am doing in my Father's name, these bear witness about me. 26 But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep. 27 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 28 I give them everlasting life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 29 What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father. 30 I and the Father are one.\"\n31 Once again the Jews picked up stones to stone him. 32 Jesus replied to them: \"I displayed to you many fine works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?\" 33 The Jews answered him: \"We are stoning you, not for a fine work, but for blasphemy; for you, although being a man, make yourself a god.\" 34 Jesus answered them: \"Is it not written in your Law, 'I said: \"You are gods\"'? 35 If he called 'gods' those against whom the word of God came-and yet the scripture cannot be nullified- 36 do you say to me whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am God's Son'? 37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me. 38 But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.\" 39 So they tried again to seize him, but he escaped from their reach.\n40 And he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there. 41 And many people came to him and began saying: \"John did not perform a single sign, but all the things John said about this man were true.\" 42 And many put faith in him there.\nChapter 11\n1 Now a man named Lazarus was sick; he was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 This was the Mary who poured perfumed oil on the Lord and wiped his feet dry with her hair; it was her brother Lazarus who was sick. 3 So his sisters sent a message to him, saying: \"Lord, see! the one you have affection for is sick.\" 4 But when Jesus heard it, he said: \"This sickness is not meant to end in death, but is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\"\n5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 However, when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he actually remained in the place where he was for two more days. 7 Then after this he said to the disciples: \"Let us go into Judea again.\" 8 The disciples said to him: \"Rabbi, just lately the Judeans were seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?\" 9 Jesus answered: \"There are 12 hours of daylight, are there not? If anyone walks in daylight, he does not stumble into anything, because he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.\"\n11 After he said these things, he added: \"Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am traveling there to awaken him.\" 12 The disciples then said to him: \"Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get well.\" 13 Jesus, however, had spoken about his death. But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep. 14 Then Jesus said to them plainly: \"Lazarus has died, 15 and I rejoice for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\" 16 So Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples: \"Let us also go, so that we may die with him.\"\n17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away. 19 And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. 20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary kept sitting at home. 21 Martha then said to Jesus: \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 22 Yet even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.\" 23 Jesus said to her: \"Your brother will rise.\" 24 Martha said to him: \"I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.\" 25 Jesus said to her: \"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life; 26 and everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all. Do you believe this?\" 27 She said to him: \"Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.\" 28 When she had said this, she went off and called Mary her sister, saying privately: \"The Teacher is here and is calling you.\" 29 On hearing this, she got up quickly and went to him.\n30 Jesus had not yet come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha had met him. 31 When the Jews who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. 32 When Mary arrived where Jesus was and caught sight of him, she fell at his feet and said to him: \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" 33 When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he groaned within himself and became troubled. 34 He said: \"Where have you laid him?\" They said to him: \"Lord, come and see.\" 35 Jesus gave way to tears. 36 At that the Jews began to say: \"See, what affection he had for him!\" 37 But some of them said: \"Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind man prevent this one from dying?\"\n38 Then Jesus, after groaning again within himself, came to the tomb. It was, in fact, a cave, and a stone was lying against it. 39 Jesus said: \"Take the stone away.\" Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him: \"Lord, by now he must smell, for it has been four days.\" 40 Jesus said to her: \"Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?\" 41 So they took the stone away. Then Jesus raised his eyes heavenward and said: \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. 42 True, I knew that you always hear me; but I spoke on account of the crowd standing around, so that they may believe that you sent me.\" 43 When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice: \"Lazarus, come out!\" 44 The man who had been dead came out with his feet and hands bound with wrappings, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them: \"Free him and let him go.\"\n45 Therefore, many of the Jews who had come to Mary and who saw what he did put faith in him, 46 but some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together and said: \"What are we to do, for this man performs many signs? 48 If we let him go on this way, they will all put faith in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\" 49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them: \"You do not know anything at all, 50 and you have not reasoned that it is to your benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people rather than for the whole nation to be destroyed.\" 51 He did not say this, however, of his own originality, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation, 52 and not only for the nation but also to gather together into one the children of God who were scattered about. 53 So from that day on they conspired to kill him.\n54 Therefore, Jesus no longer walked about publicly among the Jews, but he departed from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and he stayed there with the disciples. 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to cleanse themselves ceremonially. 56 They were looking for Jesus, and they were saying to one another as they stood around in the temple: \"What is your opinion? That he will not come to the festival at all?\" 57 But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone got to know where Jesus was, he should report it, so that they could seize him.\nChapter 12\n1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised up from the dead. 2 So they spread an evening meal for him there, and Martha was serving them, but Lazarus was one of those dining with him. 3 Then Mary took a pound of perfumed oil, genuine nard, very costly, and she poured it on the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet dry with her hair. The house became filled with the scent of the perfumed oil. 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said: 5 \"Why was this perfumed oil not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?\" 6 He said this, though, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief and had the money box and used to steal the money put in it. 7 Then Jesus said: \"Let her alone, so that she may keep this observance in view of the day of my burial. 8 For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.\"\n9 Meanwhile, a large crowd of Jews got to know that he was there, and they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised up from the dead. 10 The chief priests now conspired to kill Lazarus also, 11 since it was because of him that many of the Jews were going there and putting faith in Jesus.\n12 The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and they began to shout: \"Save, we pray you! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name, the King of Israel!\" 14 When Jesus found a young donkey, he sat on it, just as it is written: 15 \"Have no fear, daughter of Zion. Look! Your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\" 16 These things his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was glorified, they recalled that these things were written about him and that they did these things to him.\n17 Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead kept bearing witness. 18 This is also why the crowd went to meet him, because they heard he had performed this sign. 19 So the Pharisees said among themselves: \"You see that you are not getting anywhere. Look! The whole world has gone after him.\"\n20 Now there were some Greeks among those who had come to worship at the festival. 21 So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they began to request him, saying: \"Sir, we want to see Jesus.\" 22 Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.\n23 But Jesus answered them: \"The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. 24 Most truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just one grain; but if it dies, it then bears much fruit. 25 Whoever is fond of his life destroys it, but whoever hates his life in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life. 26 If anyone would minister to me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my minister will be also. If anyone would minister to me, the Father will honor him. 27 Now I am troubled, and what should I say? Father, save me out of this hour. Nevertheless, this is why I have come to this hour. 28 Father, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came out of heaven: \"I have glorified it and will glorify it again.\"\n29 The crowd that was standing there heard it and began to say that it had thundered. Others said: \"An angel has spoken to him.\" 30 Jesus answered: \"This voice has occurred, not for my sake, but for your sakes. 31 Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. 32 And yet I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all sorts of men to myself.\" 33 This he was really saying to indicate what sort of death he was about to die. 34 Then the crowd answered him: \"We heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\" 35 So Jesus said to them: \"The light will be among you a little while longer. Walk while you still have the light, so that darkness does not overpower you; whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 36 While you have the light, exercise faith in the light, so that you may become sons of light.\"\nJesus said these things and went off and hid from them. 37 Although he had performed so many signs before them, they were not putting faith in him, 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, who said: \"Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard from us? And as for the arm of Jehovah, to whom has it been revealed?\" 39 The reason why they were not able to believe is that again Isaiah said: 40 \"He has blinded their eyes and has made their hearts hard, so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn around and I heal them.\" 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him. 42 All the same, many even of the rulers actually put faith in him, but they would not acknowledge him because of the Pharisees, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue; 43 for they loved the glory of men even more than the glory of God.\n44 However, Jesus called out and said: \"Whoever puts faith in me puts faith not only in me but also in him who sent me; 45 and whoever sees me sees also the One who sent me. 46 I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness. 47 But if anyone hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 Whoever disregards me and does not receive my sayings has one to judge him. The word that I have spoken is what will judge him on the last day. 49 For I have not spoken of my own initiative, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and what to speak. 50 And I know that his commandment means everlasting life. So whatever I speak, I speak just as the Father has told me.\"\nChapter 13\n1 Now because he knew before the festival of the Passover that his hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. 2 The evening meal was going on, and the Devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him. 3 So Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God, 4 got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. And taking a towel, he wrapped it around his waist. 5 After that he put water into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him. 6 Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: \"Lord, are you washing my feet?\" 7 Jesus answered him: \"What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.\" 8 Peter said to him: \"You will certainly never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him: \"Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.\" 9 Simon Peter said to him: \"Lord, wash not only my feet but also my hands and my head.\" 10 Jesus said to him: \"Whoever has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is completely clean. And you men are clean, but not all of you.\" 11 For he knew the man who was betraying him. This is why he said: \"Not all of you are clean.\"\n12 When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on, he again reclined at the table and said to them: \"Do you understand what I have done to you? 13 You address me as 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and you are correct, for I am such. 14 Therefore, if I, the Lord and Teacher, washed your feet, you also should wash the feet of one another. 15 For I set the pattern for you, that just as I did to you, you should also do. 16 Most truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. 17 If you know these things, happy you are if you do them. 18 I am not talking about all of you; I know the ones I have chosen. But this was so that the scripture might be fulfilled: 'The one who was eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.' 19 From this moment on, I am telling you before it occurs, so that when it does occur you may believe that I am he. 20 Most truly I say to you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me also, and whoever receives me receives also the One who sent me.\"\n21 After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit, and he bore witness, saying: \"Most truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.\" 22 The disciples began to look at one another, being at a loss as to which one he was talking about. 23 One of the disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining close to Jesus. 24 Therefore, Simon Peter nodded to this one and said to him: \"Tell us whom he is talking about.\" 25 So the latter leaned back on the chest of Jesus and said to him: \"Lord, who is it?\" 26 Jesus answered: \"It is the one to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip.\" So after dipping the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. 27 After Judas took the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. So Jesus said to him: \"What you are doing, do it more quickly.\" 28 However, none of those reclining at the table knew why he said this to him. 29 Some, in fact, were thinking that since Judas was holding the money box, Jesus was telling him, \"Buy what we need for the festival,\" or that he should give something to the poor. 30 So after he received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.\n31 When, therefore, he had gone out, Jesus said: \"Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in connection with him. 32 God himself will glorify him, and he will glorify him immediately. 33 Little children, I am with you a little longer. You will look for me; and just as I said to the Jews, 'Where I go you cannot come,' I now say it also to you. 34 I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also love one another. 35 By this all will know that you are my disciples-if you have love among yourselves.\"\n36 Simon Peter said to him: \"Lord, where are you going?\" Jesus answered: \"Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.\" 37 Peter said to him: \"Lord, why is it I cannot follow you now? I will surrender my life in your behalf.\" 38 Jesus answered: \"Will you surrender your life in my behalf? Most truly I say to you, a rooster will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times.\"\nChapter 14\n1 \"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Exercise faith in God; exercise faith also in me. 2 In the house of my Father are many dwelling places. Otherwise, I would have told you, for I am going my way to prepare a place for you. 3 Also, if I go my way and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will receive you home to myself, so that where I am you also may be. 4 And where I am going, you know the way.\"\n5 Thomas said to him: \"Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?\"\n6 Jesus said to him: \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you men had known me, you would have known my Father also; from this moment on you know him and have seen him.\"\n8 Philip said to him: \"Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.\"\n9 Jesus said to him: \"Even after I have been with you men for such a long time, Philip, have you not come to know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also. How is it you say, 'Show us the Father'? 10 Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me? The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality, but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works. 11 Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me; otherwise, believe because of the works themselves. 12 Most truly I say to you, whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these, because I am going my way to the Father. 13 Also, whatever you ask in my name, I will do this, so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son. 14 If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.\n15 \"If you love me, you will observe my commandments. 16 And I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper to be with you forever, 17 the spirit of the truth, which the world cannot receive, because it neither sees it nor knows it. You know it, because it remains with you and is in you. 18 I will not leave you bereaved. I am coming to you. 19 In a little while the world will see me no more, but you will see me, because I live and you will live. 20 In that day you will know that I am in union with my Father and you are in union with me and I am in union with you. 21 Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.\"\n22 Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: \"Lord, what has happened that you intend to show yourself clearly to us and not to the world?\"\n23 In answer Jesus said to him: \"If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him. 24 Whoever does not love me does not observe my words. The word that you are hearing is not mine, but belongs to the Father who sent me.\n25 \"I have spoken these things to you while I am still with you. 26 But the helper, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you. 27 I leave you peace; I give you my peace. I do not give it to you the way that the world gives it. Do not let your hearts be troubled nor let them shrink out of fear. 28 You heard that I said to you, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am. 29 So now I have told you before it occurs, so that you may believe when it does occur. 30 I will not speak with you much more, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no hold on me. 31 But for the world to know that I love the Father, I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do. Get up, let us go from here.\nChapter 15\n1 \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator. 2 He takes away every branch in me not bearing fruit, and he cleans every one bearing fruit, so that it may bear more fruit. 3 You are already clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. 4 Remain in union with me, and I will remain in union with you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in union with me. 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever remains in union with me and I in union with him, this one bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing at all. 6 If anyone does not remain in union with me, he is thrown out like a branch and dries up. And men gather those branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. 7 If you remain in union with me and my sayings remain in you, ask whatever you wish and it will take place for you. 8 My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples. 9 Just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; remain in my love. 10 If you observe my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.\n11 \"These things I have spoken to you, so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full. 12 This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you. 13 No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you. 15 I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master does. But I have called you friends, because I have made known to you all the things I have heard from my Father. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you, and I appointed you to go and keep bearing fruit and that your fruit should remain, so that no matter what you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.\n17 \"These things I command you, that you love one another. 18 If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you. 20 Keep in mind the word I said to you: A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have observed my word, they will also observe yours. 21 But they will do all these things against you on account of my name, because they do not know the One who sent me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. 23 Whoever hates me also hates my Father. 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen me and hated me as well as my Father. 25 But this happened in order to fulfill the word written in their Law: 'They hated me without cause.' 26 When the helper comes that I will send you from the Father, the spirit of the truth, which comes from the Father, that one will bear witness about me; 27 and you, in turn, are to bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.\nChapter 16\n1 \"I have said these things to you so that you may not be stumbled. 2 Men will expel you from the synagogue. In fact, the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think he has offered a sacred service to God. 3 But they will do these things because they have not come to know either the Father or me. 4 Nevertheless, I have told you these things so that when the hour for them to happen arrives, you will remember that I told them to you.\n\"I did not tell you these things at first, because I was with you. 5 But now I am going to the One who sent me; yet not one of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' 6 But because I have told you these things, grief has filled your hearts. 7 Nevertheless, I am telling you the truth, it is for your benefit that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you; but if I do go, I will send him to you. 8 And when that one comes, he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: 9 first concerning sin, because they are not exercising faith in me; 10 then concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer; 11 then concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.\n12 \"I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now. 13 However, when that one comes, the spirit of the truth, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak of his own initiative, but what he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things to come. 14 That one will glorify me, because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to you. 15 All the things that the Father has are mine. That is why I said he receives from what is mine and declares it to you. 16 In a little while you will see me no longer, and again, in a little while you will see me.\"\n17 At that some of his disciples said to one another: \"What does he mean by saying to us, 'In a little while you will not see me, and again, in a little while you will see me,' and, 'because I am going to the Father'?\" 18 So they were saying: \"What does he mean by saying, 'a little while'? We do not know what he is talking about.\" 19 Jesus knew they wanted to question him, so he said to them: \"Are you asking one another this because I said: 'In a little while you will not see me, and again, in a little while you will see me'? 20 Most truly I say to you, you will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; you will be grieved, but your grief will be turned into joy. 21 When a woman is giving birth, she has grief because her hour has come, but when she has given birth to the child, she remembers the tribulation no more because of the joy that a child has been born into the world. 22 So you also, now you have grief; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. 23 In that day you will ask me no question at all. Most truly I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will give it to you in my name. 24 Until now you have not asked for a single thing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.\n25 \"I have spoken these things to you in comparisons. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in comparisons, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. 26 In that day you will make request of the Father in my name; in saying this, I do not mean that I will make request for you. 27 For the Father himself has affection for you, because you have had affection for me and have believed that I came as God's representative. 28 I came as the Father's representative and have come into the world. Now I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.\"\n29 His disciples said: \"See! Now you are speaking plainly and are not using comparisons. 30 Now we know that you know all things and you do not need to have anyone question you. By this we believe that you came from God.\" 31 Jesus answered them: \"Do you believe now? 32 Look! The hour is coming, indeed, it has come, when each one of you will be scattered to his own house and you will leave me alone. But I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 33 I have said these things to you so that by means of me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.\"\nChapter 17\n1 Jesus spoke these things, and raising his eyes to heaven, he said: \"Father, the hour has come. Glorify your son so that your son may glorify you, 2 just as you have given him authority over all flesh, so that he may give everlasting life to all those whom you have given to him. 3 This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ. 4 I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do. 5 So now, Father, glorify me at your side with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was.\n6 \"I have made your name manifest to the men whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have observed your word. 7 Now they have come to know that all the things you gave me are from you; 8 because I have given them the sayings that you gave me, and they have accepted them and have certainly come to know that I came as your representative, and they have believed that you sent me. 9 I make request concerning them; I make request, not concerning the world, but concerning those whom you have given me, because they are yours; 10 and all my things are yours and yours are mine, and I have been glorified among them.\n11 \"I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, watch over them on account of your own name, which you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are one. 12 When I was with them, I used to watch over them on account of your own name, which you have given me; and I have protected them, and not one of them is destroyed except the son of destruction, so that the scripture might be fulfilled. 13 But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world, so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves. 14 I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.\n15 \"I do not request that you take them out of the world, but that you watch over them because of the wicked one. 16 They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. 17 Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth. 18 Just as you sent me into the world, I also sent them into the world. 19 And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf, so that they also may be sanctified by means of truth.\n20 \"I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word, 21 so that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, so that the world may believe that you sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one. 23 I in union with them and you in union with me, in order that they may be perfected into one, so that the world may know that you sent me and that you loved them just as you loved me. 24 Father, I want those whom you have given me to be with me where I am, in order that they may look upon my glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the founding of the world. 25 Righteous Father, the world has, indeed, not come to know you, but I know you, and these have come to know that you sent me. 26 I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them.\"\nChapter 18\n1 After he said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley to where there was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it. 2 Now Judas, his betrayer, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. 3 So Judas brought the detachment of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and of the Pharisees and came there with torches and lamps and weapons. 4 Then Jesus, knowing all the things that were going to happen to him, stepped forward and said to them: \"Whom are you looking for?\" 5 They answered him: \"Jesus the Nazarene.\" He said to them: \"I am he.\" Now Judas, his betrayer, was also standing with them.\n6 However, when Jesus said to them, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 So he asked them again: \"Whom are you looking for?\" They said: \"Jesus the Nazarene.\" 8 Jesus answered: \"I told you that I am he. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.\" 9 This was to fulfill what he had said: \"Of those whom you have given me, I have not lost a single one.\"\n10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The name of the slave was Malchus. 11 Jesus, however, said to Peter: \"Put the sword into its sheath. Should I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?\"\n12 Then the soldiers and the military commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him. 13 They led him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. 14 Caiaphas was, in fact, the one who had advised the Jews that it was to their benefit for one man to die in behalf of the people.\n15 Now Simon Peter, as well as another disciple, was following Jesus. That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, 16 but Peter was standing outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in. 17 The servant girl who was the doorkeeper then said to Peter: \"You are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?\" He said: \"I am not.\" 18 Now the slaves and the officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made, because it was cold and they were warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.\n19 So the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him: \"I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret. 21 Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I told them. See! These know what I said.\" 22 After he said these things, one of the officers who was standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face and said: \"Is that the way you answer the chief priest?\" 23 Jesus answered him: \"If I said something wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said was right, why do you hit me?\" 24 Then Annas sent him away bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\n25 Now Simon Peter was standing there warming himself. Then they said to him: \"You are not also one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it and said: \"I am not.\" 26 One of the slaves of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said: \"I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?\" 27 However, Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.\n28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's residence. It was now early in the morning. But they themselves did not enter into the governor's residence, so that they would not get defiled but could eat the Passover. 29 So Pilate came outside to them and said: \"What accusation do you bring against this man?\" 30 They answered him: \"If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have handed him over to you.\" 31 So Pilate said to them: \"Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.\" The Jews said to him: \"It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.\" 32 This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate what sort of death he was about to die.\n33 So Pilate entered the governor's residence again and called Jesus and said to him: \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" 34 Jesus answered: \"Are you asking this of your own originality, or did others tell you about me?\" 35 Pilate replied: \"I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What did you do?\" 36 Jesus answered: \"My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my Kingdom is not from this source.\" 37 So Pilate said to him: \"Well, then, are you a king?\" Jesus answered: \"You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.\" 38 Pilate said to him: \"What is truth?\"\nAfter saying this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them: \"I find no fault in him. 39 Moreover, you have a custom that I should release a man to you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\" 40 Again they shouted: \"Not this man, but Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas was a robber.\nChapter 19\n1 Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him. 2 And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head and clothed him with a purple robe, 3 and they kept coming up to him and saying: \"Greetings, you King of the Jews!\" They also kept slapping him in the face. 4 Pilate went outside again and said to them: \"See! I bring him outside to you in order for you to know that I find no fault in him.\" 5 So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them: \"Look! The man!\" 6 However, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted: \"To the stake with him! To the stake with him!\" Pilate said to them: \"Take him yourselves and execute him, for I do not find any fault in him.\" 7 The Jews answered him: \"We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself God's son.\"\n8 When Pilate heard what they were saying, he became even more fearful, 9 and he entered the governor's residence again and said to Jesus: \"Where are you from?\" But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 So Pilate said to him: \"Are you refusing to speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and I have authority to execute you?\" 11 Jesus answered him: \"You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man who handed me over to you has greater sin.\"\n12 For this reason Pilate kept trying to find a way to release him, but the Jews shouted: \"If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.\" 13 Then Pilate, after hearing these words, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on a judgment seat in a place called the Stone Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 14 Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews: \"See! Your king!\" 15 However, they shouted: \"Take him away! Take him away! To the stake with him!\" Pilate said to them: \"Shall I execute your king?\" The chief priests answered: \"We have no king but Caesar.\" 16 Then he handed him over to them to be executed on the stake.\nSo they took charge of Jesus. 17 Bearing the torture stake for himself, he went out to the so-called Skull Place, which is called Golgotha in Hebrew. 18 There they nailed him to the stake alongside two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. 19 Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the torture stake. It was written: \"Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews.\" 20 Many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was nailed to the stake was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. 21 However, the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: \"Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am King of the Jews.'\" 22 Pilate answered: \"What I have written, I have written.\"\n23 Now when the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the stake, they took his outer garments and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, and they also took the inner garment. But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from top to bottom. 24 So they said to one another: \"Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots over it to decide whose it will be.\" This was to fulfill the scripture: \"They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.\" So the soldiers actually did these things.\n25 By the torture stake of Jesus, however, there were standing his mother and his mother's sister; Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. 26 So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother: \"Woman, see! Your son!\" 27 Next he said to the disciple: \"See! Your mother!\" And from that hour on, the disciple took her into his own home.\n28 After this, when Jesus knew that by now all things had been accomplished, in order to fulfill the scripture he said: \"I am thirsty.\" 29 A jar was sitting there full of sour wine. So they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop stalk and held it up to his mouth. 30 When he had received the sour wine, Jesus said: \"It has been accomplished!\" and bowing his head, he gave up his spirit.\n31 Since it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the torture stakes on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath day was a great one), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away. 32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man who was on a stake alongside him. 33 But on coming to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs. 34 But one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 35 And the one who has seen it has given this witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that what he says is true, so that you also may believe. 36 In fact, these things took place for the scripture to be fulfilled: \"Not a bone of his will be broken.\" 37 And again, a different scripture says: \"They will look to the one whom they pierced.\"\n38 Now after these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but a secret one because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body away. 39 Nicodemus, the man who had come to him in the night the first time, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds. 40 So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews. 41 Incidentally, there was a garden at the place where he was executed, and in the garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever yet been laid. 42 Because it was the day of Preparation of the Jews and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.\nChapter 20\n1 On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and she saw that the stone had already been taken away from the tomb. 2 So she came running to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, for whom Jesus had affection, and she said to them: \"They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.\"\n3 Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb. 4 The two of them began running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first. 5 Stooping forward, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and he went into the tomb. And he saw the linen cloths lying there. 7 The cloth that had been on his head was not lying with the other cloth bands but was rolled up in a place by itself. 8 Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed. 9 For they did not yet understand the scripture that he must rise from the dead. 10 So the disciples went back to their homes.\n11 Mary, however, kept standing outside near the tomb, weeping. While she was weeping, she stooped forward to look into the tomb, 12 and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet. 13 And they said to her: \"Woman, why are you weeping?\" She said to them: \"They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have laid him.\" 14 After saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her: \"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?\" She, thinking it was the gardener, said to him: \"Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.\" 16 Jesus said to her: \"Mary!\" On turning around, she said to him in Hebrew: \"Rabboni!\" (which means \"Teacher!\") 17 Jesus said to her: \"Stop clinging to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.'\" 18 Mary Magdalene came and brought the news to the disciples: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them what he had said to her.\n19 When it was late that day, the first day of the week, and the doors were locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them: \"May you have peace.\" 20 After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them again: \"May you have peace. Just as the Father has sent me, I also am sending you.\" 22 After saying this he blew on them and said to them: \"Receive holy spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you retain those of anyone, they are retained.\"\n24 But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples were telling him: \"We have seen the Lord!\" But he said to them: \"Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will never believe it.\"\n26 Well, eight days later his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and he stood in their midst and said: \"May you have peace.\" 27 Next he said to Thomas: \"Put your finger here, and see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop doubting but believe.\" 28 In answer Thomas said to him: \"My Lord and my God!\" 29 Jesus said to him: \"Because you have seen me, have you believed? Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.\"\n30 To be sure, Jesus also performed many other signs before the disciples, which are not written down in this scroll. 31 But these have been written down so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and because of believing, you may have life by means of his name.\nChapter 21\n1 After this Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples, at the Sea of Tiberias. He made the manifestation in this way. 2 There were together Simon Peter, Thomas (who was called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. 3 Simon Peter said to them: \"I am going fishing.\" They said to him: \"We are coming with you.\" They went out and got aboard the boat, but during that night they caught nothing.\n4 However, just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus said to them: \"Children, you do not have anything to eat, do you?\" They answered: \"No!\" 6 He said to them: \"Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\" So they cast it, but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish. 7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: \"It is the Lord!\" Now Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Lord, put on his outer garment, for he was naked, and plunged into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the small boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not a long way from land, only about 300 feet away.\n9 When they came ashore, they saw there a charcoal fire with fish lying on it and bread. 10 Jesus said to them: \"Bring some of the fish you just now caught.\" 11 So Simon Peter went on board and hauled the net ashore full of big fish, 153 of them. And though there were so many, the net did not burst. 12 Jesus said to them: \"Come, have your breakfast.\" Not one of the disciples had the courage to ask him: \"Who are you?\" because they knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish. 14 This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after being raised up from the dead.\n15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter: \"Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?\" He replied to him: \"Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.\" He said to him: \"Feed my lambs.\" 16 Again he said to him a second time: \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" He replied: \"Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.\" He said to him: \"Shepherd my little sheep.\" 17 He said to him a third time: \"Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?\" Peter became grieved that he asked him the third time: \"Do you have affection for me?\" So he said to him: \"Lord, you are aware of all things; you know that I have affection for you.\" Jesus said to him: \"Feed my little sheep. 18 Most truly I say to you, when you were younger, you used to clothe yourself and walk about where you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and another man will clothe you and carry you where you do not wish.\" 19 He said this to indicate by what sort of death he would glorify God. After he said this, he said to him: \"Continue following me.\"\n20 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back on his chest and said: \"Lord, who is the one betraying you?\" 21 So when he caught sight of him, Peter said to Jesus: \"Lord, what about this man?\" 22 Jesus said to him: \"If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you? You continue following me.\" 23 So the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but he said: \"If it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?\"\n24 This is the disciple who gives this witness about these things and who wrote these things, and we know that his witness is true.\n25 There are also, in fact, many other things that Jesus did, which if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written. \n",

    "text": "Acts of Apostles\nChapter 1\n1 The first account, O Theophilus, I composed about all the things Jesus started to do and to teach 2 until the day that he was taken up, after he had given instructions through holy spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After he had suffered, he showed himself alive to them by many convincing proofs. He was seen by them throughout 40 days, and he was speaking about the Kingdom of God. 4 While he was meeting with them, he ordered them: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but keep waiting for what the Father has promised, about which you heard from me; 5 for John, indeed, baptized with water, but you will be baptized with holy spirit not many days after this.\"\n6 So when they had assembled, they asked him: \"Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?\" 7 He said to them: \"It does not belong to you to know the times or seasons that the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction. 8 But you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.\" 9 After he had said these things, while they were looking on, he was lifted up and a cloud caught him up from their sight. 10 And as they were gazing into the sky while he was on his way, suddenly two men in white garments stood beside them 11 and said: \"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will come in the same manner as you have seen him going into the sky.\"\n12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from a mountain called the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, only a sabbath day's journey away. 13 When they arrived, they went up into the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter as well as John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealous one, and Judas the son of James. 14 With one purpose all of these were persisting in prayer, together with some women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.\n15 During those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (the number of people was altogether about 120) and said: 16 \"Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the holy spirit spoke prophetically through David about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. 17 For he had been numbered among us and he obtained a share in this ministry. 18 (This very man, therefore, purchased a field with the wages for unrighteousness, and falling headfirst, his body burst open and all his insides spilled out. 19 This became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, \"Field of Blood.\") 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling become desolate, and let there be no inhabitant in it' and, 'His office of oversight let someone else take.' 21 It is therefore necessary that of the men who accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus carried on his activities among us, 22 starting with his baptism by John until the day he was taken up from us, one of these men should become a witness with us of his resurrection.\"\n23 So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias. 24 Then they prayed and said: \"You, O Jehovah, who know the hearts of all, designate which one of these two men you have chosen 25 to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas deviated to go to his own place.\" 26 So they cast lots over them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was counted along with the 11 apostles.\nChapter 2\n1 Now while the day of the Festival of Pentecost was in progress, they were all together at the same place. 2 Suddenly there was a noise from heaven, just like that of a rushing, stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. 3 And tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed, and one came to rest on each one of them, 4 and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak in different languages, just as the spirit enabled them to speak.\n5 At that time devout Jews from every nation under heaven were staying in Jerusalem. 6 So when this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 7 Indeed, they were utterly amazed and said: \"See here, all these who are speaking are Galileans, are they not? 8 How is it, then, that each one of us is hearing his own native language? 9 Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya near Cyrene, sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 11 Cretans, and Arabians-we hear them speaking in our languages about the magnificent things of God.\" 12 Yes, they were all astonished and perplexed, saying to one another: \"What does this mean?\" 13 However, others mocked them and said: \"They are full of sweet wine.\"\n14 But Peter stood up with the Eleven and spoke to them in a loud voice: \"Men of Judea and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and listen carefully to my words. 15 These people are, in fact, not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day. 16 On the contrary, this is what was said through the prophet Joel: 17 '\"And in the last days,\" God says, \"I will pour out some of my spirit on every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams, 18 and even on my male slaves and on my female slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 19 And I will give wonders in heaven above and signs on earth below-blood and fire and clouds of smoke. 20 The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and illustrious day of Jehovah comes. 21 And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.\"'\n22 \"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene was a man publicly shown to you by God through powerful works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know. 23 This man, who was handed over by the determined will and foreknowledge of God, you fastened to a stake by the hand of lawless men, and you did away with him. 24 But God resurrected him by releasing him from the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held fast by it. 25 For David says about him: 'I keep Jehovah constantly in front of me, for he is at my right hand that I may never be shaken. 26 On this account my heart became cheerful and my tongue rejoiced greatly. And I will reside in hope; 27 because you will not leave me in the Grave, nor will you allow your loyal one to see corruption. 28 You have made life's ways known to me; you will fill me with great joy in your presence.'\n29 \"Men, brothers, it is permissible to speak with freeness of speech to you about the family head David, that he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 30 Because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one of his offspring on his throne, 31 he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in the Grave nor did his flesh see corruption. 32 God resurrected this Jesus, and of this we are all witnesses. 33 Therefore, because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out what you see and hear. 34 For David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, 'Jehovah said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand 35 until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.\"' 36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you executed on a stake.\"\n37 Now when they heard this, they were stabbed to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: \"Men, brothers, what should we do?\" 38 Peter said to them: \"Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit. 39 For the promise is to you and your children, and to all those who are far away, to all those whom Jehovah our God may call to himself.\" 40 And with many other words he gave a thorough witness and kept exhorting them, saying: \"Get saved from this crooked generation.\" 41 So those who gladly accepted his word were baptized, and on that day about 3,000 people were added. 42 And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles, to associating together, to the taking of meals, and to prayers.\n43 Indeed, fear began to fall upon everyone, and many wonders and signs began to occur through the apostles. 44 All those who became believers were together and had everything in common, 45 and they were selling their possessions and properties and distributing the proceeds to all, according to what each one needed. 46 And day after day they were in constant attendance in the temple with a united purpose, and they took their meals in different homes and shared their food with great rejoicing and sincerity of heart, 47 praising God and finding favor with all the people. At the same time Jehovah continued to add to them daily those being saved.\nChapter 3\n1 Now Peter and John were going up into the temple for the hour of prayer, the ninth hour, 2 and a man who was lame from birth was being carried. Every day they would put him near the temple door that was called Beautiful, so he could ask for gifts of mercy from those entering the temple. 3 When he caught sight of Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking for gifts of mercy. 4 But Peter, together with John, looked straight at him and said: \"Look at us.\" 5 So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to get something from them. 6 However, Peter said: \"Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have is what I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!\" 7 With that he took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up. Instantly his feet and his ankles were made firm; 8 and leaping to his feet, he began walking and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God. 10 And they began to recognize him, that this was the man who used to sit waiting for gifts of mercy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were completely astonished and ecstatic about what had happened to him.\n11 While the man was still holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them at what was called Solomon's Colonnade, completely surprised. 12 When Peter saw this, he said to the people: \"Men of Israel, why are you so amazed at this, and why are you staring at us as though by personal power or godly devotion we have made him walk? 13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his Servant, Jesus, whom you handed over and disowned before Pilate, even though he had decided to release him. 14 Yes, you disowned that holy and righteous one, and you asked for a man who was a murderer to be given to you, 15 whereas you killed the Chief Agent of life. But God raised him up from the dead, of which fact we are witnesses. 16 And through his name, and by our faith in his name, this man whom you see and know has been made strong. The faith that is through him has made this man completely healthy in front of all of you. 17 And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers also did. 18 But in this way God has fulfilled the things he announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer.\n19 \"Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing may come from Jehovah himself 20 and he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus. 21 Heaven must hold this one within itself until the times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old. 22 In fact, Moses said: 'Jehovah your God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you. 23 Indeed, anyone who does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.' 24 And all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed him, as many as have spoken, have also plainly declared these days. 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your forefathers, saying to Abraham: 'And by means of your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed.' 26 God, after raising up his Servant, sent him to you first to bless you by turning each one of you away from your wicked deeds.\"\nChapter 4\n1 While the two were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came up to them. 2 These were annoyed because the apostles were teaching the people and were openly declaring the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. 3 So they seized them and took them into custody until the next day, for it was already evening. 4 However, many of those who had listened to the speech believed, and the number of the men became about 5,000.\n5 The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, 6 along with Annas the chief priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were relatives of the chief priest. 7 They stood Peter and John in their midst and began to question them: \"By what power or in whose name did you do this?\" 8 Then Peter, filled with holy spirit, said to them:\n\"Rulers of the people and elders, 9 if we are being examined today about a good deed to a crippled man, and you want to know who made this man well, 10 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you executed on a stake but whom God raised up from the dead, by means of him this man stands here healthy in front of you. 11 This is 'the stone that was treated by you builders as of no account that has become the chief cornerstone.' 12 Furthermore, there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.\"\n13 Now when they saw the outspokenness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were astonished. And they began to realize that they had been with Jesus. 14 As they were looking at the man who had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in answer to this. 15 So they commanded them to go outside the Sanhedrin hall, and they began consulting with one another, 16 saying: \"What should we do with these men? Because, for a fact, a noteworthy sign has occurred through them, one evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. 17 So that this does not spread any further among the people, let us threaten them and tell them not to speak to anyone anymore on the basis of this name.\"\n18 With that they called them and ordered them not to say anything at all or to teach on the basis of the name of Jesus. 19 But in reply Peter and John said to them: \"Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves. 20 But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.\" 21 So after they had threatened them further, they released them, since they did not find any grounds for punishing them and on account of the people, because they were all glorifying God over what had happened. 22 For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been done was more than 40 years old.\n23 After being released, they went to their own people and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 24 On hearing this, they raised their voices with one accord to God and said:\n\"Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, 25 and who said through holy spirit by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant: 'Why did nations become agitated and peoples meditate on empty things? 26 The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers gathered together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.' 27 For truly both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of the nations and with peoples of Israel were gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, 28 to do what your hand and counsel had determined beforehand to occur. 29 And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant to your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, 30 while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and wonders occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\"\n31 And when they had made supplication, the place where they were gathered together was shaken, and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and were speaking the word of God with boldness.\n32 Moreover, the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and not even one of them would say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common. 33 And with great power the apostles continued giving the witness about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and undeserved kindness was upon them all in large measure. 34 In fact, no one was in need among them, for all those who owned fields or houses would sell them and bring the value of what was sold, 35 and they would deposit it at the feet of the apostles. In turn distribution would be made to each one according to his need. 36 So Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means, when translated, \"Son of Comfort\"), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 37 owned a piece of land, and he sold it and brought the money and deposited it at the feet of the apostles.\nChapter 5\n1 However, a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, sold some property. 2 But he secretly held back some of the price, with his wife's knowledge, and he brought just a part of it and deposited it at the feet of the apostles. 3 But Peter said: \"Ananias, why has Satan emboldened you to lie to the holy spirit and secretly hold back some of the price of the field? 4 As long as it remained with you, did it not remain yours? And after it was sold, was it not in your control? Why have you thought up such a deed as this in your heart? You have lied, not to men, but to God.\" 5 On hearing these words, Ananias collapsed and died. And great fear came over all those who heard about it. 6 Then the younger men rose, wrapped him in cloths, carried him out, and buried him.\n7 Now after an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 8 Peter said to her: \"Tell me, did you two sell the field for so much?\" She said: \"Yes, for that amount.\" 9 So Peter said to her: \"Why did you two agree to make a test of the spirit of Jehovah? Look! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.\" 10 Instantly she collapsed at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead and they carried her out and buried her alongside her husband. 11 So great fear came over the whole congregation and over all those hearing about these things.\n12 Moreover, through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people; and they would all meet together in Solomon's Colonnade. 13 True, none of the others had the courage to join them; nevertheless, the people were speaking highly of them. 14 More than that, believers in the Lord kept on being added, great numbers both of men and of women. 15 They even brought the sick out into the main streets and laid them there on small beds and mats, so that as Peter would pass by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them. 16 Also, crowds of people from the cities around Jerusalem kept coming, carrying sick people and those troubled with unclean spirits, and they were one and all cured.\n17 But the high priest rose, and all those with him, who were of the sect of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy. 18 And they seized the apostles and put them in the public jail. 19 But during the night, Jehovah's angel opened the doors of the prison, brought them out, and said: 20 \"Go and take your stand in the temple, and keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.\" 21 After hearing this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.\nNow when the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin and the entire assembly of elders of the sons of Israel, and they sent out to the jail to have the apostles brought before them. 22 But when the officers got there, they did not find them in the prison. So they returned and made their report, 23 saying: \"We found the jail locked and secure, and the guards were standing at the doors, but on opening it up, we found no one inside.\" 24 Well, when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about what would come of this. 25 But someone came and reported to them: \"Look! The men you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people.\" 26 Then the captain went off with his officers and brought them in, but without violence, because they were afraid of being stoned by the people.\n27 So they brought them and stood them before the Sanhedrin. Then the high priest questioned them 28 and said: \"We strictly ordered you not to keep teaching on the basis of this name, and yet look! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you are determined to bring the blood of this man upon us.\" 29 In answer Peter and the other apostles said: \"We must obey God as ruler rather than men. 30 The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a stake. 31 God exalted this one as Chief Agent and Savior to his right hand, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are witnesses of these matters, and so is the holy spirit, which God has given to those obeying him as ruler.\"\n33 When they heard this, they were infuriated and wanted to do away with them. 34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel rose in the Sanhedrin; he was a Law teacher esteemed by all the people, and he gave the command to put the men outside for a little while. 35 Then he said to them: \"Men of Israel, be careful as to what you intend to do about these men. 36 For instance, before these days Theudas rose up, saying he himself was somebody, and a number of men, about 400, joined his party. But he was done away with, and all those who were following him were dispersed and came to nothing. 37 After him, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the registration, and he drew followers after himself. That man also perished, and all those who were following him were scattered. 38 So under the present circumstances, I say to you, do not meddle with these men, but let them alone. For if this scheme or this work is from men, it will be overthrown; 39 but if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them. Otherwise, you may even be found fighters against God himself.\" 40 At this they took his advice, and they summoned the apostles, flogged them, and ordered them to stop speaking on the basis of Jesus' name, and let them go.\n41 So they went out from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name. 42 And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.\nChapter 6\n1 Now in those days when the disciples were increasing, the Greek-speaking Jews began complaining against the Hebrew-speaking Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution. 2 So the Twelve called the multitude of the disciples together and said: \"It is not right for us to leave the word of God to distribute food to tables. 3 So, brothers, select for yourselves seven reputable men from among you, full of spirit and wisdom, that we may appoint them over this necessary matter; 4 but we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.\" 5 What they said was pleasing to the whole multitude, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and holy spirit, as well as Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. 6 They brought them to the apostles, and after praying, they laid their hands on them.\n7 Consequently, the word of God continued to spread, and the number of the disciples kept multiplying very much in Jerusalem; and a large crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.\n8 Now Stephen, full of divine favor and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. 9 But some men of the so-called Synagogue of the Freedmen came forward, along with some Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, to dispute with Stephen. 10 But they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking. 11 Then they secretly persuaded men to say: \"We have heard him speaking blasphemous things against Moses and God.\" 12 And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and coming upon him suddenly, they forcibly seized him and led him to the Sanhedrin. 13 And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: \"This man does not stop speaking things against this holy place and against the Law. 14 For instance, we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will throw down this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.\"\n15 And as all those sitting in the Sanhedrin stared at him, they saw that his face was like an angel's face.\nChapter 7\n1 But the high priest said: \"Are these things so?\" 2 Stephen replied: \"Men, brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he took up residence in Haran, 3 and he said to him: 'Go out from your land and from your relatives and come into the land that I will show you.' 4 Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans and took up residence in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to resettle in this land where you now dwell. 5 And yet, he did not give him any inheritance in it, no, not even enough to put his foot on; but he promised to give it to him as a possession and after him to his offspring, though as yet he had no child. 6 Moreover, God told him that his offspring would be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people would enslave them and afflict them for 400 years. 7 'And that nation for which they will slave I will judge,' God said, 'and after these things they will come out and will offer sacred service to me in this place.'\n8 \"He also gave him a covenant of circumcision, and he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the 12 family heads. 9 And the family heads became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, 10 and he rescued him out of all his tribulations and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he appointed him to govern Egypt and his whole house. 11 But a famine came on all of Egypt and Canaan, yes, a great tribulation, and our forefathers could not find anything to eat. 12 But Jacob heard that there were food supplies in Egypt, and he sent our forefathers out the first time. 13 During the second time, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh. 14 So Joseph sent a message and called his father Jacob and all his relatives from that place, 75 persons in all. 15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died there, and so did our forefathers. 16 They were carried to Shechem and were laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.\n17 \"Just as the time was approaching to fulfill the promise that God had announced to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 18 until there rose a different king over Egypt, one who did not know of Joseph. 19 This one dealt cunningly with our people and wrongfully forced the fathers to abandon their infants so that they would not be kept alive. 20 At that time Moses was born, and he was divinely beautiful. And he was nursed for three months in his father's home. 21 But when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh took him and brought him up as her own son. 22 So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. In fact, he was powerful in his words and deeds.\n23 \"Now when he reached the age of 40, it came into his heart to make a visit on his brothers, the sons of Israel. 24 When he caught sight of one of them being unjustly treated, he defended him and avenged the one being abused by striking down the Egyptian. 25 He thought that his brothers would grasp that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not grasp it. 26 The next day he appeared to them as they were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers. Why do you mistreat each other?' 27 But the one who was mistreating his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? 28 You do not want to do away with me the way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday, do you?' 29 On hearing this, Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.\n30 \"After 40 years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in the flame of a burning thornbush. 31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. But as he was approaching to investigate, Jehovah's voice was heard: 32 'I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' Moses started trembling and did not dare to investigate further. 33 Jehovah said to him: 'Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 34 I have certainly seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you off to Egypt.' 35 This same Moses whom they had disowned, saying: 'Who appointed you ruler and judge?' is the very one God sent as both ruler and deliverer by means of the angel who appeared to him in the thornbush. 36 This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for 40 years.\n37 \"This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel: 'God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me.' 38 This is the one who came to be among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our forefathers, and he received living sacred pronouncements to give us. 39 Our forefathers refused to obey him, but they pushed him aside and in their hearts they turned back to Egypt, 40 saying to Aaron: 'Make gods for us to go ahead of us. For we do not know what has happened to this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt.' 41 So they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol and began to enjoy themselves in the works of their hands. 42 So God turned away from them and handed them over to offer sacred service to the army of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the Prophets: 'It was not to me that you made offerings and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, was it, O house of Israel? 43 But it was the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan that you took up, the images that you made to worship them. So I will deport you beyond Babylon.'\n44 \"Our forefathers had the tent of the witness in the wilderness, just as He gave orders when speaking to Moses to make it according to the pattern he had seen. 45 And our forefathers received possession of it and brought it in with Joshua into the land possessed by the nations, whom God drove out from before our forefathers. Here it remained until the days of David. 46 He found favor in the sight of God and asked for the privilege of providing a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. 47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him. 48 However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands, just as the prophet says: 49 'The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What sort of house will you build for me? Jehovah says. Or where is my resting-place? 50 My hand made all these things, did it not?'\n51 \"Obstinate men and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you are always resisting the holy spirit; as your forefathers did, so you do. 52 Which one of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become, 53 you who received the Law as transmitted by angels but have not kept it.\"\n54 Well, at hearing these things, they were infuriated in their hearts and began to grind their teeth at him. 55 But he, being full of holy spirit, gazed into heaven and caught sight of God's glory and of Jesus standing at God's right hand, 56 and he said: \"Look! I see the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God's right hand.\" 57 At this they cried out at the top of their voices and put their hands over their ears and rushed at him all together. 58 After throwing him outside the city, they began stoning him. The witnesses laid down their outer garments at the feet of a young man called Saul. 59 As they were stoning Stephen, he made this appeal: \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" 60 Then, kneeling down, he cried out with a strong voice: \"Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.\" And after saying this, he fell asleep in death.\nChapter 8\n1 Saul, for his part, approved of his murder.\nOn that day great persecution arose against the congregation that was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. 2 But devout men carried Stephen away to bury him, and they made a great mourning over him. 3 Saul, though, began to ravage the congregation. He would invade one house after another, dragging out both men and women and turning them over to prison.\n4 However, those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word. 5 Now Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to them. 6 The crowds with one accord were paying attention to what Philip said while they listened and observed the signs he was performing. 7 For many had unclean spirits, and these would cry out with a loud voice and come out. Moreover, many who were paralyzed and lame were cured. 8 So there came to be a great deal of joy in that city.\n9 Now in the city was a man named Simon, who prior to this had been practicing magical arts and amazing the nation of Samaria, claiming that he was somebody great. 10 All of them, from the least to the greatest, would pay attention to him and say: \"This man is the Power of God, which is called Great.\" 11 So they would pay attention to him because he had amazed them for quite a while by his magical arts. 12 But when they believed Philip, who was declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were getting baptized. 13 Simon himself also became a believer, and after being baptized, he continued with Philip; and he was amazed at seeing the signs and great powerful works taking place.\n14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them; 15 and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit. 16 For it had not yet come upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they began to receive holy spirit.\n18 Now when Simon saw that the spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money, 19 saying: \"Give me this authority also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive holy spirit.\" 20 But Peter said to him: \"May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire the free gift of God with money. 21 You have neither part nor share in this matter, for your heart is not straight in the sight of God. 22 So repent of this badness of yours, and supplicate Jehovah that, if possible, the wicked intention of your heart may be forgiven you; 23 for I see you are a bitter poison and a slave of unrighteousness.\" 24 In answer Simon said to them: \"Make supplication for me to Jehovah that none of the things you have said may come upon me.\"\n25 Therefore, when they had given the witness thoroughly and had spoken the word of Jehovah, they started back toward Jerusalem, and they went declaring the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.\n26 However, Jehovah's angel spoke to Philip, saying: \"Get up and go to the south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\" (This is a desert road.) 27 With that he got up and went, and look! an Ethiopian eunuch, a man who had authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and who was in charge of all her treasure. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship, 28 and he was returning and was sitting in his chariot, reading aloud the prophet Isaiah. 29 So the spirit said to Philip: \"Go over and approach this chariot.\" 30 Philip ran alongside and heard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet, and he said: \"Do you actually know what you are reading?\" 31 He said: \"Really, how could I ever do so unless someone guided me?\" So he urged Philip to get on and sit down with him. 32 Now this was the passage of Scripture that he was reading: \"Like a sheep he was brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth. 33 During his humiliation, justice was taken away from him. Who will tell the details of his generation? Because his life is taken away from the earth.\"\n34 The eunuch then said to Philip: \"I beg you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about some other man?\" 35 Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he declared to him the good news about Jesus. 36 Now as they were going along the road, they came to a body of water, and the eunuch said: \"Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?\" 37 -- 38 With that he commanded the chariot to halt, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. 39 When they came up out of the water, Jehovah's spirit quickly led Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him anymore, but he went on his way rejoicing. 40 Philip, however, found himself in Ashdod, and he went through the territory and kept on declaring the good news to all the cities until he got to Caesarea.\nChapter 9\n1 But Saul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that he might bring bound to Jerusalem any whom he found who belonged to The Way, both men and women.\n3 Now as he was traveling and getting near Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him, 4 and he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him: \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\" 5 He asked: \"Who are you, Lord?\" He said: \"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 6 But get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.\" 7 Now the men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing, indeed, the sound of a voice but seeing no one. 8 Saul then got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 And for three days he did not see anything, and he neither ate nor drank.\n10 There was a disciple named Ananias in Damascus, and the Lord said to him in a vision: \"Ananias!\" He said: \"Here I am, Lord.\" 11 The Lord said to him: \"Get up, go to the street called Straight, and look for a man named Saul, from Tarsus, at the house of Judas. For look! he is praying, 12 and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight.\" 13 But Ananias answered: \"Lord, I have heard from many about this man, about all the harm he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem. 14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all those calling on your name.\" 15 But the Lord said to him: \"Go! because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel. 16 For I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name.\"\n17 So Ananias went and entered the house, and he laid his hands on him and said: \"Saul, brother, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road along which you were coming, has sent me so that you may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit.\" 18 And immediately, what looked like scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight. He then got up and was baptized, 19 and he ate some food and gained strength.\nHe stayed for some days with the disciples in Damascus, 20 and immediately in the synagogues he began to preach about Jesus, that this one is the Son of God. 21 But all those hearing him were astonished and were saying: \"Is this not the man who ravaged those in Jerusalem who call on this name? Did he not come here for the purpose of arresting them and taking them to the chief priests?\" 22 But Saul kept on acquiring more and more power and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus, as he proved logically that this is the Christ.\n23 Now when many days had passed, the Jews plotted together to do away with him. 24 However, their plot against Saul became known to him. They were also watching the gates closely both day and night in order to do away with him. 25 So his disciples took him and let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.\n26 On arriving in Jerusalem, he made efforts to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe he was a disciple. 27 So Barnabas came to his aid and led him to the apostles, and he told them in detail how on the road he had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. 28 So he remained with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 29 He was talking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews, but these made attempts to do away with him. 30 When the brothers found out about this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.\n31 Then, indeed, the congregation throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria entered into a period of peace, being built up; and as it walked in the fear of Jehovah and in the comfort of the holy spirit, it kept on multiplying.\n32 Now as Peter was traveling through all the region, he came down also to the holy ones who lived in Lydda. 33 There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been lying flat on his bed for eight years, for he was paralyzed. 34 Peter said to him: \"Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and make up your bed.\" And he got up immediately. 35 When all those living in Lydda and the Plain of Sharon saw him, they turned to the Lord.\n36 Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means, when translated, \"Dorcas.\" She abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy that she was making. 37 But in those days she fell sick and died. So they bathed her and laid her in an upper room. 38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in that city, they sent two men to him to urge him: \"Please come to us without delay.\" 39 At that Peter got up and went with them. And when he arrived, they led him up into the upper room; and all the widows presented themselves to him, weeping and showing many garments and robes that Dorcas had made while she was with them. 40 Peter then put everyone outside, and kneeling down, he prayed. Then turning toward the body, he said: \"Tabitha, rise!\" She opened her eyes, and as she caught sight of Peter, she sat up. 41 Giving her his hand, he raised her up, and he called the holy ones and the widows and presented her alive. 42 This became known throughout all Joppa, and many became believers in the Lord. 43 He remained for quite a few days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.\nChapter 10\n1 Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, an army officer in what was called the Italian unit. 2 He was a devout man who feared God together with all his household, and he made many gifts of mercy to the people and made supplication to God continually. 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God come in to him and say: \"Cornelius!\" 4 Cornelius stared at him, terrified, and asked: \"What is it, Lord?\" He said to him: \"Your prayers and gifts of mercy have ascended as a remembrance before God. 5 So now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon who is called Peter. 6 This man is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner who has a house by the sea.\" 7 As soon as the angel who spoke to him left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who were his attendants, 8 and he related everything to them and sent them to Joppa.\n9 The next day as they were continuing on their journey and were approaching the city, Peter went up to the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. 10 But he became very hungry and wanted to eat. While they were preparing the meal, he fell into a trance 11 and saw heaven opened and something descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners on the earth; 12 and in it were all sorts of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven. 13 Then a voice said to him: \"Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!\" 14 But Peter said: \"Not at all, Lord, because I have never eaten anything defiled and unclean.\" 15 And the voice spoke again to him, the second time: \"Stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.\" 16 This happened a third time, and immediately it was taken up into heaven.\n17 While Peter was still perplexed about what the vision he had seen could mean, just then the men sent by Cornelius asked where Simon's house was and stood there at the gate. 18 They called out and inquired whether Simon who was called Peter was a guest there. 19 As Peter was still pondering over the vision, the spirit said: \"Look! Three men are asking for you. 20 So get up, go downstairs and go with them, not doubting at all, because I have sent them.\" 21 Then Peter went downstairs to the men and said: \"Here I am, the one you are looking for. Why are you here?\" 22 They said: \"Cornelius, an army officer, a righteous and God-fearing man who is well-reported-on by the whole nation of the Jews, was given divine instructions by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.\" 23 So he invited them in and had them stay as his guests.\nThe next day he got up and went off with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him. 24 The following day he entered into Caesarea. Cornelius, of course, was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 25 As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and did obeisance to him. 26 But Peter lifted him up, saying: \"Rise; I too am just a man.\" 27 As he conversed with him, he went in and found many people assembled. 28 He said to them: \"You well know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or approach a man of another nation, and yet God has shown me that I should call no man defiled or unclean. 29 So I came, really without objection, when I was sent for. Therefore, I ask you why you sent for me.\"\n30 Then Cornelius said: \"Four days ago counting from this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour; just then a man in bright clothing stood in front of me 31 and said: 'Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard, and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God. 32 Therefore, send to Joppa and call for Simon who is called Peter. This man is a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.' 33 I then sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come here. So now we are all present before God to hear all the things you have been commanded by Jehovah to say.\"\n34 At this Peter began to speak, and he said: \"Now I truly understand that God is not partial, 35 but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 36 He sent out the word to the sons of Israel to declare to them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ-this one is Lord of all. 37 You know the subject that was talked about throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee after the baptism that John preached: 38 about Jesus who was from Nazareth, how God anointed him with holy spirit and power, and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him. 39 And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; but they did away with him by hanging him on a stake. 40 God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest, 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead. 42 Also, he ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 43 To him all the prophets bear witness, that everyone putting faith in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\"\n44 While Peter was still speaking about these matters, the holy spirit came upon all those hearing the word. 45 And the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed, because the free gift of the holy spirit was being poured out also on people of the nations. 46 For they heard them speaking in foreign languages and magnifying God. Then Peter responded: 47 \"Can anyone deny water to prevent these from being baptized who have received the holy spirit just as we have?\" 48 With that he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested him to stay for some days.\nChapter 11\n1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that people of the nations had also accepted the word of God. 2 So when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the supporters of circumcision began to criticize him, 3 saying: \"You went into the house of men who were not circumcised and ate with them.\" 4 At this Peter went on to explain the matter in detail to them, saying:\n5 \"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and while in a trance I saw a vision, something descending like a great linen sheet being let down by its four corners from heaven, and it came right down to me. 6 Looking closely into it, I observed four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of heaven. 7 I also heard a voice say to me: 'Get up, Peter, slaughter and eat!' 8 But I said: 'Certainly not, Lord, because a defiled or unclean thing has never entered my mouth.' 9 The second time, the voice from heaven answered: 'You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.' 10 This happened a third time, and everything was pulled up again into heaven. 11 Also just at that moment, three men were standing at the house where we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 12 Then the spirit told me to go with them, not doubting at all. But these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.\n13 \"He reported to us how he saw the angel stand in his house and say: 'Send men to Joppa and summon Simon who is called Peter, 14 and he will tell you things by which you and all your household may get saved.' 15 But when I started to speak, the holy spirit fell on them just as it did also on us in the beginning. 16 At this I recalled the saying of the Lord, how he used to say: 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with holy spirit.' 17 If, therefore, God gave the same free gift to them that he gave to us who have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should be able to hinder God?\"\n18 When they heard these things, they stopped objecting, and they glorified God, saying: \"So, then, God has also granted to people of the nations repentance leading to life.\"\n19 Now those who had been scattered by the tribulation that arose over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews. 20 However, some of the men among them from Cyprus and Cyrene came to Antioch and began talking to the Greek-speaking people, declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus. 21 Furthermore, the hand of Jehovah was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.\n22 The report about them reached the ears of the congregation in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch. 23 When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with heartfelt resolve; 24 for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord. 25 So he went to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul. 26 After he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year they assembled with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.\n27 In those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One of them named Agabus stood up and foretold through the spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire inhabited earth, which, in fact, did take place in the time of Claudius. 29 So the disciples determined, each according to what he could afford, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea; 30 and this they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.\nChapter 12\n1 About that time Herod the king began mistreating some of those of the congregation. 2 He put James the brother of John to death by the sword. 3 When he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he also went on to arrest Peter. (This was during the days of the Unleavened Bread.) 4 He seized him and put him in prison, turning him over to four shifts of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out before the people after the Passover. 5 So Peter was being kept in the prison, but the congregation was intensely praying to God for him.\n6 When Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping bound with two chains between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison. 7 But look! Jehovah's angel was standing there, and a light shone in the prison cell. Hitting Peter on the side, he woke him, saying: \"Get up quickly!\" And the chains fell off his hands. 8 The angel said to him: \"Get dressed and put on your sandals.\" He did so. Finally he said to him: \"Put your outer garment on, and keep following me.\" 9 And he went out and kept following him, but he did not know that what was happening through the angel was real. In fact, he thought he was seeing a vision. 10 Going past the first sentinel guard and the second, they reached the iron gate leading into the city, and this opened to them by itself. After they went out, they made their way down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. 11 And Peter, realizing what was happening, said: \"Now I know for sure that Jehovah sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's hand and from everything that the Jews were expecting to happen.\"\n12 After he realized this, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John who was called Mark, where quite a few were gathered together and were praying. 13 When he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the call. 14 On recognizing the voice of Peter, she was so overjoyed that she did not open the gate, but ran inside and reported that Peter was standing at the gateway. 15 They said to her: \"You are out of your mind.\" But she kept insisting that it was so. They began to say: \"It is his angel.\" 16 But Peter remained there, knocking. When they opened the door, they saw him and were astonished. 17 But he motioned to them with his hand to be silent and told them in detail how Jehovah had brought him out of the prison, and he said: \"Report these things to James and the brothers.\" With that he went out and traveled to another place.\n18 Now when it became day, there was quite a disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. 19 Herod made a diligent search for him, and not finding him, he interrogated the guards and commanded them to be led off to punishment; and he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent some time there.\n20 Now he was in an angry mood against the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him with one purpose, and after persuading Blastus, the man in charge of the king's household affairs, they sued for peace, because their country was supplied with food from the land of the king. 21 On a set day, Herod clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down on the judgment seat and began giving them a public address. 22 Then the people who were assembled began shouting: \"A god's voice, and not a man's!\" 23 Instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten up with worms and died.\n24 But the word of Jehovah went on growing and spreading.\n25 As for Barnabas and Saul, after fully carrying out the relief work in Jerusalem, they returned and took along with them John, the one also called Mark.\nChapter 13\n1 Now in Antioch there were prophets and teachers in the local congregation: Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who was educated with Herod the district ruler, and Saul. 2 As they were ministering to Jehovah and fasting, the holy spirit said: \"Set aside for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.\" 3 Then after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.\n4 So these men, sent out by the holy spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. 5 When they arrived in Salamis, they began proclaiming the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as an attendant.\n6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they met up with a Jewish man named Bar-Jesus, who was a sorcerer and a false prophet. 7 He was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. Calling Barnabas and Saul to him, this man was eager to hear the word of God. 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is how his name is translated) began opposing them, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 9 Then Saul, also called Paul, becoming filled with holy spirit, looked at him intently 10 and said: \"O man full of every sort of fraud and every sort of villainy, you son of the Devil, you enemy of everything righteous, will you not quit distorting the right ways of Jehovah? 11 Look! Jehovah's hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a time.\" Instantly a thick mist and darkness fell on him, and he went around trying to find someone to lead him by the hand. 12 Then the proconsul, on seeing what had happened, became a believer, for he was astounded at the teaching of Jehovah.\n13 Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and arrived at Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem. 14 However, they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And going into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they took a seat. 15 After the public reading of the Law and the Prophets, the presiding officers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying: \"Men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, tell it.\" 16 So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand, he said:\n\"Men, Israelites and you others who fear God, listen. 17 The God of this people Israel chose our forefathers, and he exalted the people while they lived as foreigners in the land of Egypt and brought them out of it with an uplifted arm. 18 And for a period of about 40 years, he put up with them in the wilderness. 19 After destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he assigned their land as an inheritance. 20 All of that was during about 450 years.\n\"After this he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 21 But afterward they demanded a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for 40 years. 22 After removing him, he raised up for them David as king, about whom he bore witness and said: 'I have found David the son of Jesse a man agreeable to my heart; he will do all the things I desire.' 23 According to his promise, from the offspring of this man, God has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus. 24 Before the arrival of that one, John had preached publicly to all the people of Israel baptism in symbol of repentance. 25 But as John was finishing his course, he would say: 'What do you suppose I am? I am not he. But look! One is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'\n26 \"Men, brothers, you descendants of Abraham's family and those others among you who fear God, the word of this salvation has been sent to us. 27 For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize this one, but when acting as judges, they fulfilled the things spoken by the Prophets, which are read aloud every sabbath. 28 Even though they found no cause for death, they demanded of Pilate to have him executed. 29 And when they had accomplished all the things written about him, they took him down from the stake and laid him in a tomb. 30 But God raised him up from the dead, 31 and for many days he became visible to those who had gone with him from Galilee up to Jerusalem. These are now his witnesses to the people.\n32 \"So we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers. 33 God has completely fulfilled it to us, their children, by resurrecting Jesus; just as it is written in the second psalm: 'You are my son; today I have become your father.' 34 And the fact that He resurrected him from the dead never again to return to corruption, He has stated in this way: 'I will give you the expressions of loyal love promised to David, which are faithful.' 35 So it also says in another psalm: 'You will not allow your loyal one to see corruption.' 36 David, on the one hand, rendered service to God in his own generation, fell asleep in death, was laid with his forefathers, and did see corruption. 37 On the other hand, the one whom God raised up did not see corruption.\n38 \"Let it therefore be known to you, brothers, that through this one a forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you, 39 and that from all the things from which you could not be declared guiltless by means of the Law of Moses, everyone who believes is declared guiltless by means of this one. 40 Therefore, watch out that what is said in the Prophets does not come upon you: 41 'Look at it, you scorners, and be amazed, and perish, for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will never believe even if anyone relates it to you in detail.'\"\n42 Now when they were going out, the people pleaded with them to speak about these matters on the following Sabbath. 43 So after the synagogue assembly was dismissed, many of the Jews and the proselytes who worshipped God followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke to them, urged them to remain in the undeserved kindness of God.\n44 The next Sabbath nearly all the city gathered together to hear the word of Jehovah. 45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began blasphemously contradicting the things Paul was saying. 46 Then Paul and Barnabas boldly said to them: \"It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are rejecting it and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations. 47 For Jehovah has commanded us in these words: 'I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the ends of the earth.'\"\n48 When those of the nations heard this, they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of Jehovah, and all those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers. 49 Furthermore, the word of Jehovah was being spread throughout the whole country. 50 But the Jews incited the prominent women who were God-fearing and the principal men of the city, and they stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them outside their boundaries. 51 So they shook the dust off their feet against them and went to Iconium. 52 And the disciples continued to be filled with joy and holy spirit.\nChapter 14\n1 Now in Iconium they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks became believers. 2 But the Jews who did not believe stirred up and wrongly influenced the people of the nations against the brothers. 3 So they spent considerable time speaking with boldness by the authority of Jehovah, who bore witness to the word of his undeserved kindness by allowing signs and wonders to be performed through them. 4 However, the multitude of the city was divided; some were for the Jews but others for the apostles. 5 When both the people of the nations and the Jews with their rulers made an attempt to treat them insolently and stone them, 6 they were informed of it, and they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and to the surrounding country. 7 There they went on declaring the good news.\n8 Now in Lystra there was a man sitting down whose feet were crippled. He was lame from birth and had never walked. 9 This man was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, 10 said with a loud voice: \"Stand up on your feet.\" So the man leaped up and began walking. 11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they cried out in the Lycaonian language: \"The gods have become like humans and have come down to us!\" 12 And they started calling Barnabas Zeus, but Paul Hermes, since he was taking the lead in speaking. 13 And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifices with the crowds.\n14 However, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they ripped their garments and leaped out into the crowd and cried out: 15 \"Men, why are you doing these things? We too are humans having the same infirmities as you have. And we are declaring the good news to you, for you to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them. 16 In past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways, 17 although he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.\" 18 And yet despite saying these things, they barely restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them.\n19 But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining that he was dead. 20 However, when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and entered the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. 21 After declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. 22 There they strengthened the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith and saying: \"We must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations.\" 23 Moreover, they appointed elders for them in each congregation, offering prayer with fasting, and they entrusted them to Jehovah, in whom they had become believers.\n24 Then they went through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia, 25 and after proclaiming the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 26 From there they sailed off for Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the undeserved kindness of God for the work they had now completed.\n27 When they had arrived and had gathered the congregation together, they related the many things God had done by means of them, and that he had opened to the nations the door to faith. 28 So they spent considerable time with the disciples.\nChapter 15\n1 Now some men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers: \"Unless you get circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.\" 2 But after quite a bit of dissension and disputing by Paul and Barnabas with them, it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.\n3 So after being escorted partway by the congregation, these men continued on through both Phoenicia and Samaria, relating in detail the conversion of people of the nations and bringing great joy to all the brothers. 4 On arriving in Jerusalem, they were kindly received by the congregation and the apostles and the elders, and they related the many things God had done by means of them. 5 But some of those of the sect of the Pharisees who had become believers stood up from their seats and said: \"It is necessary to circumcise them and command them to observe the Law of Moses.\"\n6 So the apostles and the elders gathered together to look into this matter. 7 After much intense discussion had taken place, Peter rose and said to them: \"Men, brothers, you well know that from early days God made the choice among you that through my mouth people of the nations should hear the word of the good news and believe. 8 And God, who knows the heart, bore witness by giving them the holy spirit, just as he did to us also. 9 And he made no distinction at all between us and them, but purified their hearts by faith. 10 So why are you now making a test of God by imposing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we were capable of bearing? 11 On the contrary, we have faith that we are saved through the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus in the same way that they are.\"\n12 At that the entire group became silent, and they began to listen to Barnabas and Paul relate the many signs and wonders that God had done through them among the nations. 13 After they finished speaking, James replied: \"Men, brothers, hear me. 14 Symeon has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name. 15 And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written: 16 'After these things I will return and raise up again the tent of David that is fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it, 17 so that the men who remain may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah, who is doing these things, 18 known from of old.' 19 Therefore, my decision is not to trouble those from the nations who are turning to God, 20 but to write them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood. 21 For from ancient times Moses has had those who preach him in city after city, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every sabbath.\"\n22 Then the apostles and the elders, together with the whole congregation, decided to send chosen men from among them to Antioch, along with Paul and Barnabas; they sent Judas who was called Barsabbas and Silas, who were leading men among the brothers. 23 They wrote this and sent it through them:\n\"The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to those brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia who are from the nations: Greetings! 24 Since we have heard that some went out from among us and caused you trouble with what they have said, trying to subvert you, although we did not give them any instructions, 25 we have come to a unanimous decision to choose men to send to you together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 26 men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 We are therefore sending Judas and Silas, so that they also may report the same things by word of mouth. 28 For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: 29 to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!\"\n30 So when these men were dismissed, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the whole group together and handed them the letter. 31 After reading it, they rejoiced over the encouragement. 32 And Judas and Silas, since they were also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many talks and strengthened them. 33 After they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. 34 -- 35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and declaring, along with many others, the good news of the word of Jehovah.\n36 After some days, Paul said to Barnabas: \"Let us now return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities where we proclaimed the word of Jehovah, to see how they are.\" 37 Barnabas was determined to take along John, who was called Mark. 38 Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them, seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. 39 At this there was a sharp burst of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyprus. 40 Paul selected Silas and departed after he had been entrusted by the brothers to the undeserved kindness of Jehovah. 41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.\nChapter 16\n1 So he arrived at Derbe and also at Lystra. And a disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a believing Jewish woman but of a Greek father, 2 and he was well-reported-on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium. 3 Paul expressed the desire for Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 4 As they traveled on through the cities, they would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem. 5 Then, indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day.\n6 Moreover, they traveled through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, because they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in the province of Asia. 7 Further, when they came down to Mysia, they made efforts to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not permit them. 8 So they passed by Mysia and came down to Troas. 9 And during the night a vision appeared to Paul-a Macedonian man was standing there urging him and saying: \"Step over into Macedonia and help us.\" 10 As soon as he had seen the vision, we tried to go into Macedonia, drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us to declare the good news to them.\n11 So we put out to sea from Troas and made a straight run to Samothrace, but on the following day to Neapolis; 12 and from there we went to Philippi, a colony, which is the principal city of the district of Macedonia. We stayed in this city for some days. 13 On the Sabbath day we went outside the gate beside a river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled. 14 And a woman named Lydia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira and a worshipper of God, was listening, and Jehovah opened her heart wide to pay attention to the things Paul was saying. 15 Now when she and her household got baptized, she urged us: \"If you have considered me to be faithful to Jehovah, come and stay at my house.\" And she just made us come.\n16 Now it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a servant girl with a spirit, a demon of divination, met us. She supplied her masters with much profit by fortune-telling. 17 This girl kept following Paul and us and crying out with the words: \"These men are slaves of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.\" 18 She kept doing this for many days. Finally Paul got tired of it and turned and said to the spirit: \"I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.\" And it came out that very hour.\n19 Well, when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers. 20 Leading them up to the civil magistrates, they said: \"These men are disturbing our city very much. They are Jews, 21 and they are proclaiming customs that it is not lawful for us to adopt or practice, seeing that we are Romans.\" 22 And the crowd rose up together against them, and the civil magistrates, after tearing the garments off them, gave the command to beat them with rods. 23 After they had inflicted many blows on them, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to guard them securely. 24 Because he got such an order, he threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.\n25 But about the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song, and the prisoners were listening to them. 26 Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the jail were shaken. Moreover, all the doors were instantly opened, and everyone's bonds came loose. 27 When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, assuming that the prisoners had escaped. 28 But Paul called out with a loud voice: \"Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here!\" 29 So he asked for lights and rushed in, and seized with trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas. 30 He brought them outside and said: \"Sirs, what must I do to get saved?\" 31 They said: \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will get saved, you and your household.\" 32 Then they spoke the word of Jehovah to him together with all those in his house. 33 And he took them along in that hour of the night and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire household were baptized without delay. 34 He brought them into his house and set a table before them, and he rejoiced greatly with all his household now that he had believed in God.\n35 When it became day, the civil magistrates sent the constables to say: \"Release those men.\" 36 The jailer reported their words to Paul: \"The civil magistrates have sent men to have you two released. So come out now and go in peace.\" 37 But Paul said to them: \"They flogged us publicly, uncondemned, though we are Romans, and threw us into prison. Are they now throwing us out secretly? No, indeed! Let them come themselves and escort us out.\" 38 The constables reported these words to the civil magistrates. These grew fearful when they heard that the men were Romans. 39 So they came and pleaded with them, and after escorting them out, they requested them to depart from the city. 40 But they came out of the prison and went to the home of Lydia; and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.\nChapter 17\n1 They now traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. 2 So according to Paul's custom he went inside to them, and for three sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 3 explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, saying: \"This is the Christ, this Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you.\" 4 As a result, some of them became believers and associated themselves with Paul and Silas, and so did a great multitude of the Greeks who worshipped God, along with quite a few of the principal women.\n5 But the Jews, getting jealous, gathered together some wicked men who were loitering at the marketplace and formed a mob and proceeded to throw the city into an uproar. They assaulted the house of Jason and were seeking to have Paul and Silas brought out to the mob. 6 When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers to the city rulers, crying out: \"These men who have overturned the inhabited earth are present here also, 7 and Jason has received them as his guests. All these men act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.\" 8 When they heard these things, the crowd and the city rulers were alarmed; 9 and after taking sufficient security from Jason and the others, they let them go.\n10 Immediately by night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Beroea. On arriving, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. 12 Therefore, many of them became believers, and so did quite a few of the reputable Greek women as well as some of the men. 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was also being proclaimed by Paul in Beroea, they came there to incite and agitate the crowds. 14 Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy remained behind there. 15 However, those accompanying Paul brought him as far as Athens, and they departed after receiving instructions that Silas and Timothy should come to Paul as quickly as possible.\n16 Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit within him became irritated on seeing that the city was full of idols. 17 So he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshipped God and every day in the marketplace with those who happened to be on hand. 18 But some of both the Epicurean and the Stoic philosophers began disputing with him, and some were saying: \"What is it this chatterer would like to tell?\" Others: \"He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities.\" This was because he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection. 19 So they took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying: \"Can we get to know what this new teaching is that you are speaking about? 20 For you are introducing some things that are strange to our ears, and we want to know what these things mean.\" 21 In fact, all Athenians and the foreigners staying there would spend their leisure time doing nothing else but telling or listening to something new. 22 Paul now stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said:\n\"Men of Athens, I see that in all things you seem to be more given to the fear of the deities than others are. 23 For instance, while passing along and carefully observing your objects of veneration, I found even an altar on which had been inscribed 'To an Unknown God.' Therefore, what you are unknowingly worshipping, this I am declaring to you. 24 The God who made the world and all the things in it, being, as he is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples; 25 nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things. 26 And he made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed times and the set limits of where men would dwell, 27 so that they would seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us. 28 For by him we have life and move and exist, even as some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his children.'\n29 \"Therefore, since we are the children of God, we should not think that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, like something sculptured by the art and design of humans. 30 True, God has overlooked the times of such ignorance; but now he is declaring to all people everywhere that they should repent. 31 Because he has set a day on which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has provided a guarantee to all men by resurrecting him from the dead.\"\n32 Now when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to scoff, while others said: \"We will hear you again about this.\" 33 So Paul left them, 34 but some men joined him and became believers. Among them were Dionysius, who was a judge of the court of the Areopagus, and a woman named Damaris, and others besides them.\nChapter 18\n1 After this he departed from Athens and came to Corinth. 2 And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus who had recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. So he went to them, 3 and because he had the same trade, he stayed at their home and worked with them, for they were tentmakers by trade. 4 He would give a talk in the synagogue every sabbath and would persuade Jews and Greeks.\n5 When, now, both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul began to be intensely occupied with the word, witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ. 6 But after they kept on opposing him and speaking abusively, he shook out his garments and said to them: \"Let your blood be on your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to people of the nations.\" 7 So he transferred from there and went into the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house adjoined the synagogue. 8 But Crispus, the presiding officer of the synagogue, became a believer in the Lord, along with all his household. And many of the Corinthians who heard began to believe and be baptized. 9 Moreover, the Lord said to Paul in a vision by night: \"Do not be afraid, but keep on speaking and do not keep silent, 10 for I am with you and no man will assault you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.\" 11 So he stayed there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.\n12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a concerted attack against Paul and led him to the judgment seat, 13 saying: \"This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law.\" 14 But as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews: \"If, indeed, it were some wrong or a serious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear you out patiently. 15 But if it is controversies over speech and names and your own law, you yourselves must see to it. I do not wish to be a judge of these things.\" 16 With that he drove them away from the judgment seat. 17 So they all seized Sosthenes, the presiding officer of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio would not get involved at all with these things.\n18 However, after staying quite a few days longer, Paul said good-bye to the brothers and sailed away for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. He had his hair clipped short in Cenchreae, for he had made a vow. 19 So they arrived at Ephesus, and he left them there; but he entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 20 Although they kept requesting him to stay longer, he would not consent 21 but said good-bye and told them: \"I will return to you again, if Jehovah is willing.\" And he put out to sea from Ephesus 22 and came down to Caesarea. And he went up and greeted the congregation and then went down to Antioch.\n23 After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.\n24 Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, arrived in Ephesus; he was an eloquent man who was well-versed in the Scriptures. 25 This man had been instructed in the way of Jehovah, and aglow with the spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, but he was acquainted only with the baptism of John. 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him into their company and explained the way of God more accurately to him. 27 Further, because he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples, urging them to receive him kindly. So when he got there, he greatly helped those who through God's undeserved kindness had become believers; 28 for publicly and with great intensity he thoroughly proved the Jews to be wrong, showing them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.\nChapter 19\n1 In the course of events, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul went through the inland regions and came down to Ephesus. There he found some disciples 2 and said to them: \"Did you receive holy spirit when you became believers?\" They replied to him: \"Why, we have never heard that there is a holy spirit.\" 3 So he said: \"In what, then, were you baptized?\" They said: \"In John's baptism.\" 4 Paul said: \"John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" 5 On hearing this, they got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul laid his hands on them, the holy spirit came upon them, and they began speaking in foreign languages and prophesying. 7 There were about 12 men in all.\n8 Entering the synagogue, for three months he spoke with boldness, giving talks and reasoning persuasively about the Kingdom of God. 9 But when some stubbornly refused to believe, speaking injuriously about The Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples from them, giving talks daily in the school auditorium of Tyrannus. 10 This went on for two years, so that all those living in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.\n11 And God kept performing extraordinary powerful works through the hands of Paul, 12 so that even cloths and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits came out. 13 But some of the Jews who traveled around casting out demons also tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits; they would say: \"I solemnly charge you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.\" 14 Now there were seven sons of a Jewish chief priest named Sceva doing this. 15 But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: \"I know Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul; but who are you?\" 16 At that the man with the wicked spirit leaped on them, overpowered them one after the other, and prevailed against them, so that they fled naked and wounded out of that house. 17 This became known to all, both the Jews and the Greeks who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus went on being magnified. 18 And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly. 19 Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody. And they calculated their value and found them worth 50,000 pieces of silver. 20 Thus in a mighty way, the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing.\n21 After these things had taken place, Paul resolved in his spirit that after going through Macedonia and Achaia, he would travel to Jerusalem. He said: \"After going there, I must also see Rome.\" 22 So he sent to Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed on for some time in the province of Asia.\n23 At that time quite a disturbance arose concerning The Way. 24 For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought considerable profit to the craftsmen. 25 He gathered them and others who worked at such things and said: \"Men, you well know that from this business comes our prosperity. 26 Now you see and hear how, not only in Ephesus but in nearly all the province of Asia, this Paul has persuaded a considerable crowd and turned them to another opinion, saying that the gods made by hands are not really gods. 27 Moreover, the danger exists not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be viewed as nothing, and she who is worshipped in the whole province of Asia and the inhabited earth will be deprived of her magnificence.\" 28 Hearing this and becoming full of anger, the men began crying out: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\"\n29 So the city became filled with confusion, and all together they rushed into the theater, dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul. 30 For his part, Paul was willing to go inside to the people, but the disciples would not permit him. 31 Even some of the commissioners of festivals and games who were friendly to him sent word to him, pleading with him not to risk going into the theater. 32 Some were, in fact, crying out one thing and others something else; for the assembly was in confusion and the majority of them did not know the reason why they had come together. 33 So they brought Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews shoving him forward, and Alexander motioned with his hand and wanted to make his defense to the people. 34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all started shouting in unison for about two hours: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\"\n35 When the city recorder had finally quieted the crowd, he said: \"Men of Ephesus, who really is there among men who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven? 36 Since these things are indisputable, you should keep calm and not act rashly. 37 For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess. 38 So if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him do have a case against someone, court days are held and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another. 39 But if you are searching for anything beyond that, it must be decided in a regular assembly. 40 For we are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today's affair, since there are no grounds we could present as a reason for this disorderly mob.\" 41 And after saying this, he dismissed the assembly.\nChapter 20\n1 When the uproar had subsided, Paul sent for the disciples, and after he had encouraged them and said farewell, he began his journey to Macedonia. 2 After going through those regions and giving many words of encouragement to the ones there, he arrived in Greece. 3 He spent three months there, but because a plot was hatched against him by the Jews when he was about to set sail for Syria, he made up his mind to return through Macedonia. 4 He was accompanied by Sopater the son of Pyrrhus of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy and, from the province of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 5 These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas; 6 but we put out to sea from Philippi after the days of the Unleavened Bread, and within five days we came to them in Troas, and there we spent seven days.\n7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to have a meal, Paul began addressing them, as he was going to depart the next day; and he prolonged his speech until midnight. 8 So there were quite a few lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together. 9 Seated at the window, a young man named Eutychus sank into a deep sleep while Paul kept talking, and overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. 10 But Paul went downstairs, threw himself on him and embraced him, and said: \"Stop making a commotion, for he is alive.\" 11 He then went upstairs and began the meal and ate. He continued conversing for quite a while, until daybreak, and then he departed. 12 So they took the boy away alive and were comforted beyond measure.\n13 We now went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, where we were intending to take Paul aboard, for after giving instructions to this effect, he was intending to go there on foot. 14 So when he caught up with us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene. 15 And sailing away from there the next day, we arrived off Chios, but the day after that, we touched at Samos, and on the following day, we arrived at Miletus. 16 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so as not to spend any time in the province of Asia, for he was hurrying to get to Jerusalem on the day of the Festival of Pentecost if he possibly could.\n17 However, from Miletus he sent word to Ephesus and called for the elders of the congregation. 18 When they came to him, he said to them: \"You well know how I conducted myself among you from the first day I stepped into the province of Asia, 19 slaving for the Lord with all humility and with tears and trials that befell me by the plots of the Jews, 20 while I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house. 21 But I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. 22 And now look! bound in the spirit, I am traveling to Jerusalem, although not knowing what will happen to me there, 23 except that from city to city the holy spirit repeatedly bears witness to me, saying that imprisonment and tribulations are waiting for me. 24 Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life of any importance to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.\n25 \"And now look! I know that none of you among whom I preached the Kingdom will ever see my face again. 26 So I call you to witness this very day that I am clean from the blood of all men, 27 for I have not held back from telling you all the counsel of God. 28 Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son. 29 I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, 30 and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.\n31 \"Therefore keep awake, and bear in mind that for three years, night and day, I never stopped admonishing each one of you with tears. 32 And now I entrust you to God and to the word of his undeserved kindness, which word can build you up and give you the inheritance among all the sanctified ones. 33 I have desired no man's silver or gold or clothing. 34 You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my own needs and the needs of those with me. 35 I have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way, you must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said: 'There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.'\"\n36 And when he had said these things, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. 37 Indeed, quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all, and they embraced Paul and affectionately kissed him, 38 for they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they would not see his face anymore. Then they accompanied him to the ship.\nChapter 21\n1 After tearing ourselves away from them and putting out to sea, we ran with a straight course and came to Cos, on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 2 When we found a ship that was crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and sailed away. 3 After coming in sight of the island of Cyprus, we left it behind on the left side and sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo. 4 We searched for and found the disciples and remained there for seven days. But through the spirit they repeatedly told Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem. 5 So when our time there was over, we left and started on our way, but they all, together with the women and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed 6 and said good-bye to one another. Then we went aboard the ship, and they returned to their homes.\n7 We then completed the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed one day with them. 8 The next day we left and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelizer, who was one of the seven men, and we stayed with him. 9 This man had four unmarried daughters who prophesied. 10 But after we had stayed there for quite a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 11 And he came to us and took Paul's belt and tied his own feet and hands and said: \"Thus says the holy spirit, 'The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like this by the Jews in Jerusalem, and they will give him into the hands of people of the nations.'\" 12 Now when we heard this, both we and those who were there began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered: \"What are you doing by weeping and trying to weaken my resolve? Rest assured, I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\" 14 When he would not be dissuaded, we stopped objecting and said: \"Let the will of Jehovah take place.\"\n15 Now after these days we prepared for the journey and started on our way to Jerusalem. 16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, taking us to Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple at whose home we were to be guests. 17 When we got to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly. 18 But on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. 19 And he greeted them and began giving a detailed account of the things God did among the nations through his ministry.\n20 After hearing this, they began to glorify God, but they said to him: \"You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the Law. 21 But they have heard it rumored about you that you have been teaching all the Jews among the nations an apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to follow the customary practices. 22 What, then, is to be done about it? They are certainly going to hear that you have arrived. 23 So do what we tell you: We have four men who have put themselves under a vow. 24 Take these men with you and cleanse yourself ceremonially together with them and take care of their expenses, so that they may have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you, but that you are walking orderly and you are also keeping the Law. 25 As for the believers from among the nations, we have sent them our decision in writing that they should keep away from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.\"\n26 Then Paul took the men the next day and cleansed himself ceremonially along with them, and he went into the temple to give notice of when the days for the ceremonial cleansing would be completed and the offering should be presented for each one of them.\n27 Now when the seven days were about to end, the Jews from Asia, on seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd, and they seized him, 28 shouting: \"Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our Law and this place. And what is more, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.\" 29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple. 30 The whole city was in an uproar, and the people came running together and seized Paul and dragged him outside the temple, and immediately the doors were closed. 31 While they were trying to kill him, word reached the commander of the army unit that all Jerusalem was in confusion; 32 and he immediately took soldiers and army officers and ran down to them. When they caught sight of the military commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.\n33 Then the military commander came near and took him into custody and ordered that he be bound with two chains; then he inquired who he was and what he had done. 34 But some in the crowd began shouting out one thing, and others something else. So being unable himself to learn anything for certain because of the disturbance, he commanded him to be brought to the soldiers' quarters. 35 But when he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, 36 for a crowd of the people kept following, crying out: \"Do away with him!\"\n37 As he was about to be led into the soldiers' quarters, Paul said to the military commander: \"Am I allowed to say something to you?\" He said: \"Can you speak Greek? 38 Are you not, then, the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a sedition and led the 4,000 dagger men out into the wilderness?\" 39 Then Paul said: \"I am, in fact, a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. So I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.\" 40 After he gave permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned with his hand to the people. When a great silence fell, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:\nChapter 22\n1 \"Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now.\" 2 Well, when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent, and he said: 3 \"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral Law, and zealous for God just as all of you are this day. 4 I persecuted this Way to the point of death, binding and handing over to prisons both men and women, 5 as the high priest and all the assembly of elders can bear witness. From them I also obtained letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring those who were there in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.\n6 \"But as I was traveling and getting near to Damascus, about midday, suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me, 7 and I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' 8 I answered: 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me: 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.' 9 Now the men who were with me did see the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me. 10 At that I said: 'What should I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me: 'Rise, go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything it is appointed for you to do.' 11 But since I could not see anything because of the glory of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me.\n12 \"Then a man named Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, well-reported-on by all the Jews living there, 13 came to me. He stood by me and said to me: 'Saul, brother, regain your sight!' And that very moment I looked up and saw him. 14 He said: 'The God of our forefathers has chosen you to come to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear the voice of his mouth, 15 because you are to be a witness for him to all men of the things you have seen and heard. 16 And now why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized, and wash your sins away by your calling on his name.'\n17 \"But when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance 18 and saw him saying to me: 'Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your witness concerning me.' 19 And I said: 'Lord, they themselves well know that I used to imprison and flog in one synagogue after another those believing in you; 20 and when the blood of Stephen your witness was being spilled, I was standing by and approving and guarding the outer garments of those doing away with him.' 21 And yet he said to me: 'Go, because I will send you out to nations far away.'\"\n22 Now they kept listening to him down to this word. Then they raised their voices, saying: \"Take such a man away from the earth, for he is not fit to live!\" 23 Because they were crying out, throwing their outer garments about, and tossing dust into the air, 24 the military commander ordered Paul to be brought into the soldiers' quarters and said that he should be interrogated under scourging, so that he could learn exactly why they were shouting against Paul this way. 25 But when they had stretched him out for the whipping, Paul said to the army officer standing there: \"Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman who has not been condemned?\" 26 Well, when the army officer heard this, he went to the military commander and reported it, saying: \"What are you intending to do? For this man is a Roman.\" 27 So the military commander approached and said to him: \"Tell me, are you a Roman?\" He said: \"Yes.\" 28 The military commander responded: \"I purchased these rights as a citizen for a large sum of money.\" Paul said: \"But I have them by birth.\"\n29 Immediately, therefore, the men who were about to interrogate him under torture backed away from him; and the military commander became afraid when he realized that he was a Roman and that he had bound him in chains.\n30 So the next day, because he wanted to know for sure just why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. He then brought Paul down and had him stand among them.\nChapter 23\n1 Looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said: \"Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with a perfectly clear conscience down to this day.\" 2 At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to strike him on the mouth. 3 Then Paul said to him: \"God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. Do you sit to judge me according to the Law and at the same time violate the Law by commanding me to be struck?\" 4 Those standing by said: \"Are you insulting the high priest of God?\" 5 And Paul said: \"Brothers, I did not know he was high priest. For it is written, 'You must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people.'\"\n6 Now Paul, knowing that the one part was made up of Sadducees but the other of Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin: \"Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Over the hope of the resurrection of the dead I am being judged.\" 7 Because he said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was split. 8 For the Sadducees say that there is neither resurrection nor angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees accept them all. 9 So a great uproar broke out, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees rose and began arguing fiercely, saying: \"We find nothing wrong in this man, but if a spirit or an angel spoke to him-.\" 10 Now when the dissension grew great, the military commander feared that Paul would be torn apart by them, and he commanded the soldiers to go down and snatch him from their midst and bring him into the soldiers' quarters.\n11 But the following night the Lord stood by him and said: \"Take courage! For just as you have been giving a thorough witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.\"\n12 When it became day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. 13 There were more than 40 men who formed this oath-bound conspiracy. 14 These men went to the chief priests and the elders and said: \"We have solemnly bound ourselves with a curse not to eat anything at all until we have killed Paul. 15 So now you together with the Sanhedrin should inform the military commander that he should bring him down to you as though you want to examine his case more thoroughly. But before he gets near, we will be ready to do away with him.\"\n16 However, the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush they were planning, and he entered the soldiers' quarters and reported it to Paul. 17 Paul then called one of the army officers to him and said: \"Take this young man to the military commander, for he has something to report to him.\" 18 So he brought him and led him to the military commander and said: \"The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.\" 19 The military commander took him by the hand and withdrew privately and asked him: \"What do you have to report to me?\" 20 He said: \"The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they intend to learn more details about his case. 21 But do not let them persuade you, for more than 40 of their men are waiting to ambush him, and they have bound themselves with a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him; and they are now ready, waiting for the promise from you.\" 22 So the military commander let the young man go, after ordering him: \"Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of this.\"\n23 And he summoned two of the army officers and said: \"Get 200 soldiers ready to march clear to Caesarea, also 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen, at the third hour of the night. 24 Also, provide horses for Paul to ride, to take him safely to Felix the governor.\" 25 And he wrote a letter with this content:\n26 \"Claudius Lysias to His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings! 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but I came quickly with my soldiers and rescued him, because I learned that he is a Roman. 28 And wanting to find out the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrin. 29 I found him to be accused about questions of their Law, but not charged with a single thing deserving of death or prison bonds. 30 But because a plot against the man has been made known to me, I am at once sending him to you and ordering the accusers to speak against him before you.\"\n31 So these soldiers took Paul according to their orders and brought him by night to Antipatris. 32 The next day they permitted the horsemen to go on with him, but they returned to the soldiers' quarters. 33 The horsemen entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor and also presented Paul to him. 34 So he read it and asked what province he was from and learned that he was from Cilicia. 35 \"I will give you a thorough hearing,\" he said, \"when your accusers arrive.\" And he commanded that he be kept under guard in Herod's palace.\nChapter 24\n1 Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a public speaker named Tertullus, and they presented their case against Paul to the governor. 2 When he was called, Tertullus started accusing him, saying:\n\"Seeing that we enjoy great peace through you and that through your forethought reforms are taking place in this nation, 3 at all times and also in all places we acknowledge this, Your Excellency Felix, with the greatest thankfulness. 4 But that I may not detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly in your kindness. 5 For we have found this man to be a pest, stirring up seditions among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and he is a spearhead of the sect of the Nazarenes. 6 He also tried to profane the temple, so we seized him. 7 -- 8 When you examine him yourself, you will find out about all these things of which we are accusing him.\"\n9 With that the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were true. 10 When the governor nodded to Paul to speak, he answered:\n\"Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for many years, I readily speak in my own defense. 11 As you can verify for yourself, it has not been more than 12 days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem; 12 and they found me neither arguing with anyone in the temple nor stirring up a mob, either in the synagogues or throughout the city. 13 Nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of right now. 14 But I do admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers, as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets. 15 And I have hope toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. 16 Because of this I always strive to maintain a clear conscience before God and men. 17 Now after quite a number of years, I arrived to bring gifts of mercy to my nation and to make offerings. 18 While I was caring for these matters, they found me ceremonially cleansed in the temple, but not with a crowd or causing a disturbance. But there were some Jews from the province of Asia 19 who ought to be present before you to accuse me if they actually have anything against me. 20 Or let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanhedrin, 21 except for this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: 'Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before you!'\"\n22 However, Felix, knowing quite well the facts concerning this Way, began to put them off and say: \"Whenever Lysias the military commander comes down, I will decide these matters involving you.\" 23 And he gave orders to the army officer that the man be kept under arrest but given some freedom, and that his people be allowed to attend to his needs.\n24 Some days later Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about the belief in Christ Jesus. 25 But as Paul talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and answered: \"Go away for now, but when I have an opportunity I will send for you again.\" 26 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him money. For that reason, he sent for him even more frequently and conversed with him. 27 But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor with the Jews, he left Paul in custody.\nChapter 25\n1 Therefore Festus, after arriving in the province and taking charge, went up three days later to Jerusalem from Caesarea. 2 And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews gave him information against Paul. So they began to beg Festus 3 as a favor to send for Paul to come to Jerusalem. But they were planning to ambush Paul and kill him along the road. 4 However, Festus answered that Paul was to be kept in Caesarea and that he himself was about to go back there shortly. 5 \"So let those who are in power among you,\" he said, \"come down with me and accuse him if, indeed, the man has done something wrong.\"\n6 So when he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat down on the judgment seat and commanded Paul to be brought in. 7 When he came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many serious charges that they were unable to prove.\n8 But Paul said in defense: \"Neither against the Law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I committed any sin.\" 9 Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, said in reply to Paul: \"Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be judged before me there concerning these things?\" 10 But Paul said: \"I am standing before the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, of which you are also becoming well-aware. 11 If I am really a wrongdoer and have committed anything deserving of death, I do not beg off from dying; but if there is no substance to the accusations these men have made against me, no man has the right to hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to Caesar!\" 12 Then Festus, after speaking with the assembly of counselors, replied: \"To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you will go.\"\n13 After some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived in Caesarea for a courtesy visit to Festus. 14 Since they were spending a number of days there, Festus presented Paul's case to the king, saying:\n\"There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix, 15 and when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought information about him, asking for a judgment of condemnation against him. 16 But I replied to them that it is not Roman procedure to hand any man over as a favor before the accused man meets his accusers face-to-face and gets a chance to speak in his defense concerning the complaint. 17 So when they arrived here, I did not delay, but the next day I sat down on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in. 18 Taking the stand, the accusers did not charge him with any of the wicked things I had expected concerning him. 19 They simply had certain disputes with him concerning their own worship of the deity and concerning a man named Jesus, who was dead but who Paul kept asserting was alive. 20 Being at a loss as to how to handle this dispute, I asked if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these matters. 21 But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision by the August One, I commanded him to be held until I should send him on to Caesar.\"\n22 Agrippa then said to Festus: \"I would like to hear the man myself.\" \"Tomorrow,\" he said, \"you will hear him.\" 23 So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with much pompous show and entered the audience chamber together with military commanders as well as the prominent men in the city; and when Festus gave the command, Paul was brought in. 24 And Festus said: \"King Agrippa and all you who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish populace have petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. 25 But I perceived that he had done nothing deserving of death. So when this man himself appealed to the August One, I decided to send him. 26 But I have nothing certain to write about him to my Lord. So I brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the judicial examination has taken place, I might have something to write. 27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not also to indicate the charges against him.\"\nChapter 26\n1 Agrippa said to Paul: \"You are permitted to speak in your own behalf.\" Then Paul stretched out his hand and proceeded to say in his defense:\n2 \"Concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself happy that it is before you I am to make my defense this day, 3 especially because you are an expert on all the customs as well as the controversies among the Jews. Therefore, I beg you to hear me patiently.\n4 \"Indeed, the manner of life I led from youth up among my people and in Jerusalem is well-known by all the Jews 5 who were previously acquainted with me, if they would be willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our form of worship, I lived as a Pharisee. 6 But now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to our forefathers, I stand on trial; 7 this is the same promise our 12 tribes are hoping to see fulfilled by intensely rendering him sacred service night and day. Concerning this hope I am accused by Jews, O King.\n8 \"Why is it considered unbelievable among you that God raises up the dead? 9 I, for one, was convinced that I should commit many acts of opposition against the name of Jesus the Nazarene. 10 This is exactly what I did in Jerusalem, and I locked up many of the holy ones in prisons, for I had received authority from the chief priests; and when they were to be executed, I cast my vote against them. 11 By punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to recant; and since I was extremely furious with them, I went so far as to persecute them even in outlying cities.\n12 \"While doing this as I was traveling to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests, 13 I saw at midday on the road, O King, a light beyond the brilliance of the sun flash from heaven around me and around those traveling with me. 14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language: 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? To keep kicking against the goads makes it hard for you.' 15 But I said: 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said: 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 16 But rise and stand on your feet. This is why I have appeared to you, to choose you as a servant and a witness both of things you have seen and things I will make you see respecting me. 17 And I will rescue you from this people and from the nations, to whom I am sending you 18 to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me.'\n19 \"Therefore, King Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision, 20 but to those in Damascus first and then to those in Jerusalem, and over all the country of Judea, and also to the nations, I was bringing the message that they should repent and turn to God by doing works that befit repentance. 21 This is why the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. 22 However, because I have experienced the help that is from God, I continue to this day bearing witness to both small and great, saying nothing except what the Prophets as well as Moses stated was going to take place- 23 that the Christ was to suffer and that as the first to be resurrected from the dead, he was going to proclaim light both to this people and to the nations.\"\n24 Now as Paul was saying these things in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice: \"You are going out of your mind, Paul! Great learning is driving you out of your mind!\" 25 But Paul said: \"I am not going out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus, but I am speaking words of truth and of a sound mind. 26 For a fact, the king to whom I am speaking so freely well knows about these things; I am convinced that not one of these things escapes his notice, for none of this has been done in a corner. 27 Do you, King Agrippa, believe the Prophets? I know that you believe.\" 28 But Agrippa said to Paul: \"In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.\" 29 At this Paul said: \"I wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I am, with the exception of these prison bonds.\"\n30 Then the king rose and so did the governor and Bernice and the men seated with them. 31 But as they were leaving, they began saying to one another: \"This man is doing nothing deserving of death or prison bonds.\" 32 Agrippa then said to Festus: \"This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.\"\nChapter 27\n1 Now as it was decided for us to sail away to Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to an army officer named Julius, of the unit of Augustus. 2 Going aboard a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to ports along the coast of the province of Asia, we set sail; Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. 3 The next day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul with kindness and permitted him to go to his friends and enjoy their care.\n4 And putting out to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 5 Then we navigated through the open sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia and put into port at Myra in Lycia. 6 There the army officer found a ship from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy, and he made us board it. 7 Then after sailing on slowly quite a number of days, we came to Cnidus with difficulty. Because the wind did not let us make headway, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone. 8 And sailing with difficulty along the coast, we came to a place called Fair Havens, which was near the city of Lasea.\n9 A considerable time had passed and by now it was hazardous to navigate, because even the fast of Atonement Day was already over, so Paul made a recommendation 10 to them: \"Men, I can see that this voyage is going to result in damage and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives.\" 11 However, the army officer listened to the pilot and the shipowner rather than to what Paul was saying. 12 Since the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, the majority advised setting sail from there to see if they could somehow make it to spend the winter in Phoenix, a harbor of Crete that opens toward the northeast and toward the southeast.\n13 When the south wind blew softly, they thought they had achieved their purpose, and they lifted anchor and began sailing along Crete close to the shore. 14 After a short time, however, a violent wind called Euroaquilo rushed down on it. 15 As the ship was violently seized and was not able to keep its head against the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. 16 Then we ran under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, and yet we were hardly able to get the skiff at the stern of the ship under control. 17 But after hoisting it aboard, they used supports to undergird the ship, and fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along. 18 Because we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to lighten the ship the following day. 19 And on the third day, they threw away the tackling of the ship with their own hands.\n20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent storm was battering us, all hope of our being saved finally began to fade. 21 After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up in their midst and said: \"Men, you certainly should have taken my advice and not have put out to sea from Crete and as a result suffered this damage and loss. 22 Still, I now urge you to take courage, for not one of you will be lost, only the ship will. 23 This night an angel of the God to whom I belong and to whom I render sacred service stood by me 24 and said: 'Have no fear, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and look! God has granted to you all those sailing with you.' 25 So take courage, men, for I believe God that it will be exactly as I was told. 26 However, we must be cast ashore on some island.\"\n27 Now when the 14th night fell and we were being tossed about on the Sea of Adria, at midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were getting near to some land. 28 They sounded the depth and found it 20 fathoms, so they proceeded a short distance and again made a sounding and found it 15 fathoms. 29 And fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they cast out four anchors from the stern and began wishing for it to become day. 30 But when the sailors began trying to escape from the ship and were lowering the skiff into the sea under the pretense of intending to let down anchors from the bow, 31 Paul said to the army officer and the soldiers: \"Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.\" 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.\n33 Now close to daybreak, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying: \"Today is the 14th day you have been waiting anxiously, and you have gone without taking any food at all. 34 So I encourage you to eat some food; this is in the interests of your safety, for not a hair of the head of any one of you will perish.\" 35 After he said this, he took bread, gave thanks to God before them all, broke it, and started eating. 36 So they all took courage and began taking some food themselves. 37 In all we were 276 persons in the ship. 38 When they had eaten enough food to be satisfied, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard into the sea.\n39 When daylight came, they could not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a beach and were determined to beach the ship there if they could. 40 So they cut away the anchors and let them fall into the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudder oars; and after hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. 41 When they struck a shoal washed on each side by the sea, they ran the ship aground and the bow got stuck and stayed immovable, but the stern began to be violently broken to pieces by the waves. 42 At this the soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so that no one might swim away and escape. 43 But the army officer was determined to bring Paul safely through and prevented them from carrying out their plan. He commanded those able to swim to jump into the sea and make it to land first, 44 and the rest were to follow, some on planks and some on pieces of the ship. So all were brought safely to land.\nChapter 28\n1 After we made it to safety, we learned that the island was called Malta. 2 And the foreign-speaking people showed us extraordinary kindness. They kindled a fire and received all of us kindly because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold. 3 But when Paul collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. 4 When the foreign-speaking people caught sight of the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another: \"Surely this man is a murderer, and although he made it to safety from the sea, Justice did not permit him to keep on living.\" 5 However, he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm. 6 But they were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to drop dead. After they waited for a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him, they changed their mind and began saying he was a god.\n7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the principal man of the island, whose name was Publius, and he welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days. 8 It so happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with fever and dysentery, and Paul went in to him and prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him. 9 After this occurred, the rest of the people on the island who were sick also began to come to him and be cured. 10 They also honored us with many gifts, and when we were setting sail, they loaded us up with whatever we needed.\n11 Three months later we set sail in a ship with the figurehead \"Sons of Zeus.\" The ship was from Alexandria and had wintered in the island. 12 Putting into port at Syracuse, we remained there for three days; 13 from there we went along and arrived at Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and we made it into Puteoli on the second day. 14 Here we found brothers and were urged to remain with them for seven days, and so we went toward Rome. 15 From there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came as far as the Marketplace of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage. 16 When finally we entered Rome, Paul was permitted to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.\n17 However, three days later he called together the principal men of the Jews. When they had assembled, he said to them: \"Men, brothers, although I had done nothing contrary to the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 18 And after making an examination, they wanted to release me, for there were no grounds for putting me to death. 19 But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, but not because I had any accusation to make against my nation. 20 So for this reason I asked to see and speak to you, for it is because of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me.\" 21 They said to him: \"We have not received letters about you from Judea, nor have any of the brothers who came from there reported or spoken anything bad about you. 22 But we think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for truly as regards this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.\"\n23 They now arranged for a day to meet with him, and they came in even greater numbers to him in his lodging place. And from morning to evening, he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the Kingdom of God, to persuade them about Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets. 24 Some began to believe the things he said; others would not believe. 25 So because they disagreed with one another, they began to leave, and Paul made this one comment:\n\"The holy spirit aptly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers, 26 saying, 'Go to this people and say: \"You will indeed hear but by no means understand, and you will indeed look but by no means see. 27 For the heart of this people has grown unreceptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes, so that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back and I heal them.\"' 28 So let it be known to you that this salvation from God has been sent out to the nations; they will certainly listen to it.\" 29 --\n30 So he remained there for an entire two years in his own rented house, and he would kindly receive all those who came to him, 31 preaching the Kingdom of God to them and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with the greatest freeness of speech, without hindrance. \n",

    "text": "Romans\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus and called to be an apostle, set apart for God's good news, 2 which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, 3 concerning his Son, who came to be from the offspring of David according to the flesh, 4 but who with power was declared God's Son according to the spirit of holiness by means of resurrection from the dead-yes, Jesus Christ our Lord. 5 Through him we received undeserved kindness and an apostleship with a view to obedience by faith among all the nations respecting his name, 6 among which nations you also have been called to belong to Jesus Christ- 7 to all those who are in Rome as God's beloved ones, called to be holy ones:\nMay you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n8 First of all, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of you, because your faith is talked about throughout the whole world. 9 For God, to whom I render sacred service with my spirit in connection with the good news about his Son, is my witness of how without ceasing I always mention you in my prayers, 10 begging that if at all possible I may now at last succeed in coming to you by God's will. 11 For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you for you to be made firm; 12 or, rather, that we may have an interchange of encouragement by one another's faith, both yours and mine.\n13 But I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that many times I have intended to come to you-but I have been prevented until now-in order that I might acquire some fruitage also among you just as among the rest of the nations. 14 Both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise and to senseless ones, I am a debtor; 15 so I am eager to declare the good news also to you there in Rome. 16 For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact, God's power for salvation to everyone having faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 17 For in it God's righteousness is being revealed by faith and for faith, just as it is written: \"But the righteous one will live by reason of faith.\"\n18 For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way, 19 because what may be known about God is clearly evident among them, for God made it clear to them. 20 For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable. 21 For although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their senseless hearts became darkened. 22 Although claiming they were wise, they became foolish 23 and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and birds and four-footed creatures and reptiles.\n24 Therefore, God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, so that their bodies might be dishonored among them. 25 They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen. 26 That is why God gave them over to disgraceful sexual passion, for their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; 27 likewise also the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full penalty, which was due for their error.\n28 Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them over to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting. 29 And they were filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, and badness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice, being whisperers, 30 backbiters, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, schemers of what is harmful, disobedient to parents, 31 without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, and merciless. 32 Although these know full well the righteous decree of God-that those practicing such things are deserving of death-they not only keep on doing them but also approve of those practicing them.\nChapter 2\n1 Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, if you judge; for when you judge another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge practice the same things. 2 Now we know that God's judgment is in harmony with truth, against those who practice such things.\n3 But do you suppose, O man, that while you judge those who practice such things and yet you do them, you will escape the judgment of God? 4 Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, because you do not know that God in his kindness is trying to lead you to repentance? 5 But according to your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God's righteous judgment. 6 And he will pay back to each one according to his works: 7 everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good; 8 however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and anger. 9 There will be tribulation and distress on every person who works what is harmful, on the Jew first and also on the Greek; 10 but glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. 11 For there is no partiality with God.\n12 For all those who sinned without law will also perish without law; but all those who sinned under law will be judged by law. 13 For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous. 14 For when people of the nations, who do not have law, do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves. 15 They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them, and by their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused. 16 This will take place in the day when God through Christ Jesus judges the secret things of mankind, according to the good news I declare.\n17 If, now, you are a Jew in name and rely on law and take pride in God, 18 and you know his will and approve of things that are excellent because you are instructed out of the Law, 19 and you are convinced that you are a guide of the blind, a light for those in darkness, 20 a corrector of the unreasonable ones, a teacher of young children, and having the framework of the knowledge and of the truth in the Law- 21 do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself? You, the one preaching, \"Do not steal,\" do you steal? 22 You, the one saying, \"Do not commit adultery,\" do you commit adultery? You, the one abhorring idols, do you rob temples? 23 You who take pride in law, do you dishonor God by your transgressing of the Law? 24 For \"the name of God is being blasphemed among the nations because of you,\" just as it is written.\n25 Circumcision is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 26 If, therefore, an uncircumcised person keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not? 27 And the physically uncircumcised person will, by carrying out the Law, judge you who are a transgressor of law despite having its written code and circumcision. 28 For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision something on the outside, on the flesh. 29 But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit and not by a written code. That person's praise comes from God, not from people.\nChapter 3\n1 What, then, is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision? 2 A great deal in every way. First of all, that they were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God. 3 What, then, is the case? If some lacked faith, will their lack of faith invalidate the faithfulness of God? 4 Certainly not! But let God be found true, even if every man be found a liar, just as it is written: \"That you might be proved righteous in your words and might win when you are being judged.\" 5 However, if our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness, what are we to say? God is not unjust when he expresses his wrath, is he? (I am speaking in human terms.) 6 By no means! How, otherwise, will God judge the world?\n7 But if by my lie the truth of God has been made more prominent to his glory, why am I also being judged as a sinner? 8 And why not say, just as some men falsely claim that we say, \"Let us do bad things that good things may come\"? The judgment against those men is in harmony with justice.\n9 What then? Are we in a better position? Not at all! For above we have made the charge that Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin; 10 just as it is written: \"There is not a righteous man, not even one; 11 there is no one who has any insight; there is no one who searches for God. 12 All men have turned aside, all of them have become worthless; there is no one who shows kindness, not so much as one.\" 13 \"Their throat is an open grave; they have deceived with their tongues.\" \"Venom of asps is behind their lips.\" 14 \"And their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.\" 15 \"Their feet are swift to shed blood.\" 16 \"Ruin and misery are in their ways, 17 and they have not known the way of peace.\" 18 \"There is no fear of God before their eyes.\"\n19 Now we know that all the things the Law says, it addresses to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be silenced and all the world may become accountable to God for punishment. 20 Therefore, no one will be declared righteous before him by works of law, for by law comes the accurate knowledge of sin.\n21 But now apart from law God's righteousness has been revealed, as the Law and the Prophets bear witness, 22 yes, God's righteousness through the faith in Jesus Christ, for all those having faith. For there is no distinction. 23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented him as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood. This was to demonstrate his own righteousness, because God in his forbearance was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past. 26 This was to demonstrate his own righteousness in this present season, so that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man who has faith in Jesus.\n27 Where, then, is the boasting? There is no place for it. Through what law? That of works? No indeed, but through the law of faith. 28 For we consider that a man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law. 29 Or is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of people of the nations? Yes, also of people of the nations. 30 Since God is one, he will declare circumcised people righteous as a result of faith and uncircumcised people righteous by means of their faith. 31 Do we, then, abolish law by means of our faith? Not at all! On the contrary, we uphold law.\nChapter 4\n1 That being so, what will we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? 2 For instance, if Abraham was declared righteous as a result of works, he would have reason to boast, but not with God. 3 For what does the scripture say? \"Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.\" 4 Now to the man who works, his pay is not counted as an undeserved kindness but as something owed to him. 5 On the other hand, to the man who does not work but puts faith in the One who declares the ungodly one righteous, his faith is counted as righteousness. 6 Just as David also speaks of the happiness of the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: 7 \"Happy are those whose lawless deeds have been pardoned and whose sins have been covered; 8 happy is the man whose sin Jehovah will by no means take into account.\"\n9 Does this happiness, then, only come to circumcised people or also to uncircumcised people? For we say: \"Abraham's faith was counted to him as righteousness.\" 10 Under what circumstances, then, was it counted as righteousness? When he was circumcised or uncircumcised? He was not yet circumcised but was uncircumcised. 11 And he received a sign-namely, circumcision-as a seal of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, so that he might be the father of all those having faith while uncircumcised, in order for righteousness to be counted to them; 12 and so that he might be a father to circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had while in the uncircumcised state.\n13 For it was not through law that Abraham or his offspring had the promise that he should be heir of a world, but it was through righteousness by faith. 14 For if those who adhere to law are heirs, faith becomes useless and the promise has been abolished. 15 In reality the Law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there any transgression.\n16 That is why it is through faith, so that it might be according to undeserved kindness, in order for the promise to be sure to all his offspring, not only to those who adhere to the Law but also to those who adhere to the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. 17 (This is just as it is written: \"I have appointed you a father of many nations.\") This was in the sight of God, in whom he had faith, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they are. 18 Although beyond hope, yet based on hope, he had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said: \"So your offspring will be.\" 19 And although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body, now as good as dead (since he was about 100 years old), as well as the deadness of the womb of Sarah. 20 But because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith; but he became powerful by his faith, giving God glory 21 and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to do. 22 Therefore, \"it was counted to him as righteousness.\"\n23 However, the words \"it was counted to him\" were not written for his sake only, 24 but also for our sake, to whom it will be counted, because we believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord up from the dead. 25 He was handed over for the sake of our trespasses and was raised up for the sake of declaring us righteous.\nChapter 5\n1 Therefore, now that we have been declared righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom we also have obtained access by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand; and let us rejoice, based on hope of the glory of God. 3 Not only that, but let us rejoice while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance; 4 endurance, in turn, an approved condition; the approved condition, in turn, hope, 5 and the hope does not lead to disappointment; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given to us.\n6 For, indeed, while we were still weak, Christ died for ungodly men at the appointed time. 7 For hardly would anyone die for a righteous man; though perhaps for a good man someone may dare to die. 8 But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more, then, since we have now been declared righteous by his blood, will we be saved through him from wrath. 10 For if when we were enemies we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more we will be saved by his life, now that we have become reconciled. 11 Not only that, but we are also rejoicing in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.\n12 That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned-. 13 For sin was in the world before the Law, but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the same way that Adam transgressed, who bears a resemblance to the one who was to come.\n15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by one man's trespass many died, how much more did the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift by the undeserved kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to many! 16 Also, it is not the same with the free gift as with the way things worked through the one man who sinned. For the judgment after one trespass was condemnation, but the gift after many trespasses was a declaration of righteousness. 17 For if by the trespass of the one man death ruled as king through that one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness and of the free gift of righteousness rule as kings in life through the one person, Jesus Christ!\n18 So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, so too through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is their being declared righteous for life. 19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous. 20 Now the Law came on the scene so that trespassing might increase. But where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more. 21 To what end? So that just as sin ruled as king with death, so also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness leading to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\nChapter 6\n1 What are we to say then? Should we continue in sin so that undeserved kindness may increase? 2 Certainly not! Seeing that we died with reference to sin, how can we keep living any longer in it? 3 Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 So we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in a newness of life. 5 If we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection. 6 For we know that our old personality was nailed to the stake along with him in order for our sinful body to be made powerless, so that we should no longer go on being slaves to sin. 7 For the one who has died has been acquitted from his sin.\n8 Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 9 For we know that Christ, now that he has been raised up from the dead, dies no more; death is no longer master over him. 10 For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin once for all time, but the life that he lives, he lives with reference to God. 11 Likewise you, consider yourselves to be dead with reference to sin but living with reference to God by Christ Jesus.\n12 Therefore, do not let sin continue to rule as king in your mortal bodies so that you should obey their desires. 13 Neither go on presenting your bodies to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, also your bodies to God as weapons of righteousness. 14 For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.\n15 What follows? Are we to commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness? Certainly not! 16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin leading to death or of obedience leading to righteousness? 17 But thanks to God that although you were once the slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that pattern of teaching to which you were handed over. 18 Yes, since you were set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness. 19 I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh; for just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness leading to lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness. 20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as to righteousness.\n21 What, then, was the fruit that you used to produce at that time? Things of which you are now ashamed. For the end of those things is death. 22 However, now that you were set free from sin and became slaves to God, you are producing your fruit in the way of holiness, and the end is everlasting life. 23 For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.\nChapter 7\n1 Can it be that you do not know, brothers, (for I am speaking to those who know law) that the Law is master over a man as long as he lives? 2 For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband. 3 So, then, while her husband is living, she would be called an adulteress if she became another man's. But if her husband dies, she is free from his law, so that she is not an adulteress if she becomes another man's.\n4 So, my brothers, you also were made dead to the Law through the body of the Christ, that you might become another's, the one who was raised up from the dead, so that we should bear fruit to God. 5 For when we were living according to the flesh, the sinful passions that were awakened by the Law were at work in our bodies to produce fruit for death. 6 But now we have been released from the Law, because we have died to that which restrained us, in order that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit and not in the old sense by the written code.\n7 What, then, are we to say? Is the Law sin? Certainly not! Really, I would not have come to know sin had it not been for the Law. For example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: \"You must not covet.\" 8 But sin, finding the opportunity afforded by the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead. 9 In fact, I was once alive apart from law. But when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died. 10 And the commandment that was to lead to life, this I found led to death. 11 For sin, finding the opportunity afforded by the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it. 12 So the Law in itself is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.\n13 Therefore, did what is good result in my death? Certainly not! But sin did, that it might be shown to be sin working out death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become far more sinful. 14 For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin. 15 For I do not understand what I am doing. For I do not practice what I wish, but I do what I hate. 16 However, if I do what I do not wish, I agree that the Law is fine. 17 But now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is the sin that resides in me. 18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; for I have the desire to do what is fine but not the ability to carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good that I wish, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice. 20 If, then, I do what I do not wish, I am no longer the one carrying it out, but it is the sin dwelling in me.\n21 I find, then, this law in my case: When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. 22 I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, 23 but I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin's law that is in my body. 24 Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death? 25 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So, then, with my mind I myself am a slave to God's law, but with my flesh to sin's law.\nChapter 8\n1 Therefore, those in union with Christ Jesus have no condemnation. 2 For the law of the spirit that gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. 3 What the Law was incapable of doing because it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemning sin in the flesh, 4 so that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walk, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. 5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the spirit, on the things of the spirit. 6 For setting the mind on the flesh means death, but setting the mind on the spirit means life and peace; 7 because setting the mind on the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not in subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be. 8 So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God.\n9 However, you are in harmony, not with the flesh, but with the spirit, if God's spirit truly dwells in you. But if anyone does not have Christ's spirit, this person does not belong to him. 10 But if Christ is in union with you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 If, now, the spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in you.\n12 So, then, brothers, we are under obligation, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh; 13 for if you live according to the flesh, you are sure to die; but if you put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, you will live. 14 For all who are led by God's spirit are indeed God's sons. 15 For you did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: \"Abba, Father!\" 16 The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God's children. 17 If, then, we are children, we are also heirs-heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ-provided we suffer together so that we may also be glorified together.\n18 For I consider that the sufferings of the present time do not amount to anything in comparison with the glory that is going to be revealed in us. 19 For the creation is waiting with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God. 20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but through the one who subjected it, on the basis of hope 21 that the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God. 22 For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now. 23 Not only that, but we ourselves also who have the firstfruits, namely, the spirit, yes, we ourselves groan within ourselves while we are earnestly waiting for adoption as sons, the release from our bodies by ransom. 24 For we were saved in this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for when a man sees a thing, does he hope for it? 25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we keep eagerly waiting for it with endurance.\n26 In like manner, the spirit also joins in with help for our weakness; for the problem is that we do not know what we should pray for as we need to, but the spirit itself pleads for us with unuttered groanings. 27 But the one who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in harmony with God for the holy ones.\n28 We know that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of those who love God, those who are the ones called according to his purpose; 29 because those whom he gave his first recognition he also foreordained to be patterned after the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. 30 Moreover, those whom he foreordained are the ones he also called; and those whom he called are the ones he also declared to be righteous. Finally those whom he declared righteous are the ones he also glorified.\n31 What, then, are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who will be against us? 32 Since he did not even spare his own Son but handed him over for us all, will he not also, along with him, kindly give us all other things? 33 Who will file accusation against God's chosen ones? God is the One who declares them righteous. 34 Who will condemn them? Christ Jesus is the one who died, yes, more than that, the one who was raised up, who is at the right hand of God and who also pleads for us.\n35 Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword? 36 Just as it is written: \"For your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.\" 37 On the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\nChapter 9\n1 I am telling the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as my conscience bears witness with me in holy spirit, 2 that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart. 3 For I could wish that I myself were separated from the Christ as the cursed one for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh, 4 who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the sacred service and the promises. 5 To them the forefathers belong, and from them the Christ descended according to the flesh. God, who is over all, be praised forever. Amen.\n6 However, it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who descend from Israel are really \"Israel.\" 7 Neither are they all children because they are Abraham's offspring; rather, \"What will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.\" 8 That is, the children in the flesh are not really the children of God, but the children by the promise are counted as the offspring. 9 For the word of promise was as follows: \"At this time I will come and Sarah will have a son.\" 10 Not only then but also when Rebekah conceived twins from the one man, Isaac our forefather; 11 for when they had not yet been born and had not practiced anything good or bad, so that God's purpose respecting the choosing might continue dependent, not on works, but on the One who calls, 12 it was said to her: \"The older will be the slave of the younger.\" 13 Just as it is written: \"I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated.\"\n14 What are we to say, then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not! 15 For he says to Moses: \"I will show mercy to whomever I will show mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I will show compassion.\" 16 So, then, it depends, not on a person's desire or on his effort, but on God, who has mercy. 17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh: \"For this very reason I have let you remain: to show my power in connection with you and to have my name declared in all the earth.\" 18 So, then, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, but he lets whomever he wishes become obstinate.\n19 You will therefore say to me: \"Why does he still find fault? For who has withstood his will?\" 20 But who are you, O man, to be answering back to God? Does the thing molded say to its molder: \"Why did you make me this way?\" 21 What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use? 22 What, then, if God had the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, and he tolerated with much patience vessels of wrath made fit for destruction? 23 And if this was done to make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, 24 namely, us, whom he called not only from among Jews but also from among nations, what of it? 25 It is as he says also in Hosea: \"Those not my people I will call 'my people,' and her who was not loved, 'beloved'; 26 and in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'\"\n27 Moreover, Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: \"Although the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved. 28 For Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth, concluding it and cutting it short.\" 29 Also, just as Isaiah foretold: \"Unless Jehovah of armies had left an offspring to us, we should have become just like Sodom, and we should have resembled Gomorrah.\"\n30 What are we to say, then? That people of the nations, although not pursuing righteousness, attained righteousness, the righteousness that results from faith; 31 but Israel, although pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to that law. 32 For what reason? Because they pursued it, not by faith, but as by works. They stumbled over the \"stone of stumbling\"; 33 as it is written: \"Look! I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, but the one who rests his faith on it will not be disappointed.\"\nChapter 10\n1 Brothers, the goodwill of my heart and my supplication to God for them are indeed for their salvation. 2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to accurate knowledge. 3 For because of not knowing the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness.\n5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the Law: \"The man who does these things will live by means of them.\" 6 But the righteousness resulting from faith says: \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down, 7 or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.\" 8 But what does it say? \"The word is near you, in your own mouth and in your own heart\"; that is, \"the word\" of faith, which we are preaching. 9 For if you publicly declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.\n11 For the scripture says: \"No one who rests his faith on him will be disappointed.\" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. There is the same Lord over all, who is rich toward all those calling on him. 13 For \"everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.\" 14 However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him? How, in turn, will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? 15 How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent out? Just as it is written: \"How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!\"\n16 Nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. For Isaiah says: \"Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard from us?\" 17 So faith follows the thing heard. In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ. 18 But I ask, They did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, \"into all the earth their sound went out, and to the ends of the inhabited earth their message.\" 19 But I ask, Israel did not fail to know, did they? First Moses says: \"I will incite you to jealousy through that which is not a nation; I will incite you to violent anger through a foolish nation.\" 20 But Isaiah becomes very bold and says: \"I was found by those who were not seeking me; I became known to those who were not asking for me.\" 21 But he says regarding Israel: \"All day long I have spread out my hands toward a disobedient and obstinate people.\"\nChapter 11\n1 I ask, then, God did not reject his people, did he? By no means! For I too am an Israelite, of the offspring of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God did not reject his people, whom he first recognized. Do you not know what the scripture says in connection with Elijah, as he pleads with God against Israel? 3 \"Jehovah, they have killed your prophets, they have dug up your altars, and I alone am left, and now they are trying to take my life.\" 4 Yet, what does the divine pronouncement say to him? \"I have left for myself 7,000 men who have not bent the knee to Baal.\" 5 So in the same way, at the present time also, there is a remnant according to a choosing through undeserved kindness. 6 Now if it is by undeserved kindness, it is no longer through works; otherwise, the undeserved kindness would no longer be undeserved kindness.\n7 What, then? The very thing Israel is earnestly seeking he did not obtain, but the ones chosen obtained it. The rest had their senses dulled, 8 just as it is written: \"God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, down to this very day.\" 9 Also, David says: \"Let their table become a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a retribution for them. 10 Let their eyes become darkened so that they cannot see, and always make them bend their backs.\"\n11 So I ask, They did not stumble and fall completely, did they? Certainly not! But by their false step, there is salvation to people of the nations, to incite them to jealousy. 12 Now if their false step means riches to the world and their decrease means riches to people of the nations, how much more will their full number mean!\n13 Now I speak to you who are people of the nations. Seeing that I am an apostle to the nations, I glorify my ministry 14 to see if I may in some way incite my own people to jealousy and save some from among them. 15 For if their being cast away means reconciliation for the world, what will the acceptance of them mean but life from the dead? 16 Further, if the part of the dough taken as firstfruits is holy, the entire batch is also holy; and if the root is holy, the branches are also.\n17 However, if some of the branches were broken off and you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the richness of the olive's root, 18 do not be arrogant toward the branches. If, though, you are arrogant toward them, remember that you do not bear the root, but the root bears you. 19 You will say, then: \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\" 20 That is true! For their lack of faith, they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. Do not be haughty, but be in fear. 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. 22 Consider, therefore, God's kindness and severity. There is severity toward those who fell, but toward you there is God's kindness, provided you remain in his kindness; otherwise, you too will be lopped off. 23 And they also, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them back in. 24 For if you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into the garden olive tree, how much more will these who are natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!\n25 For I do not want you to be unaware of this sacred secret, brothers, so that you do not become wise in your own eyes: A partial dulling of senses has come upon Israel until the full number of people of the nations has come in, 26 and in this manner all Israel will be saved. Just as it is written: \"The deliverer will come out of Zion and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob. 27 And this is my covenant with them, when I take their sins away.\" 28 True, with respect to the good news, they are enemies for your sakes; but with respect to God's choosing, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. 29 For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret. 30 For just as you were once disobedient to God but have now been shown mercy because of their disobedience, 31 so also these now have been disobedient with mercy resulting to you, so that they themselves may also now be shown mercy. 32 For God has confined all of them together in disobedience so that he might show all of them mercy.\n33 O the depth of God's riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and beyond tracing out his ways are! 34 For \"who has come to know Jehovah's mind, or who has become his adviser?\" 35 Or, \"who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?\" 36 Because from him and by him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.\nChapter 12\n1 Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. 2 And stop being molded by this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\n3 For through the undeserved kindness given to me, I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think, but to think so as to have a sound mind, each one as God has given to him a measure of faith. 4 For just as we have in one body many members, but the members do not all have the same function, 5 so we, although many, are one body in union with Christ, but individually we are members belonging to one another. 6 Since, then, we have gifts that differ according to the undeserved kindness given to us, if it is of prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; 7 or if it is a ministry, let us be at this ministry; or the one who teaches, let him be at his teaching; 8 or the one who encourages, let him give encouragement; the one who distributes, let him do it liberally; the one who presides, let him do it diligently; the one who shows mercy, let him do it cheerfully.\n9 Let your love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is wicked; cling to what is good. 10 In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another, take the lead. 11 Be industrious, not lazy. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah. 12 Rejoice in the hope. Endure under tribulation. Persevere in prayer. 13 Share with the holy ones according to their needs. Follow the course of hospitality. 14 Keep on blessing those who persecute; bless and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 16 Have the same attitude toward others as toward yourselves; do not set your mind on lofty things, but be led along with the lowly things. Do not become wise in your own eyes.\n17 Return evil for evil to no one. Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men. 18 If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men. 19 Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: \"'Vengeance is mine; I will repay,' says Jehovah.\" 20 But \"if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals on his head.\" 21 Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.\nChapter 13\n1 Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. 2 Therefore, whoever opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will bring judgment against themselves. 3 For those rulers are an object of fear, not to the good deed, but to the bad. Do you want to be free of fear of the authority? Keep doing good, and you will have praise from it; 4 for it is God's minister to you for your good. But if you are doing what is bad, be in fear, for it is not without purpose that it bears the sword. It is God's minister, an avenger to express wrath against the one practicing what is bad.\n5 There is therefore compelling reason for you to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath but also on account of your conscience. 6 That is why you are also paying taxes; for they are God's public servants constantly serving this very purpose. 7 Render to all their dues: to the one who calls for the tax, the tax; to the one who calls for the tribute, the tribute; to the one who calls for fear, such fear; to the one who calls for honor, such honor.\n8 Do not owe anything to anyone except to love one another; for whoever loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law. 9 For the law code, \"You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not covet,\" and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this saying: \"You must love your neighbor as yourself.\" 10 Love does not work evil to one's neighbor; therefore, love is the law's fulfillment.\n11 And do this because you know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers. 12 The night is well along; the day has drawn near. Let us therefore throw off the works belonging to darkness and let us put on the weapons of the light. 13 Let us walk decently as in the daytime, not in wild parties and drunkenness, not in immoral intercourse and brazen conduct, not in strife and jealousy. 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.\nChapter 14\n1 Welcome the man having weaknesses in his faith, but do not pass judgment on differing opinions. 2 One man has faith to eat everything, but the man who is weak eats only vegetables. 3 Let the one eating not look down on the one not eating, and let the one not eating not judge the one eating, for God has welcomed him. 4 Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for Jehovah can make him stand.\n5 One man judges one day as above another; another judges one day the same as all others; let each one be fully convinced in his own mind. 6 The one who observes the day observes it to Jehovah. Also, the one who eats, eats to Jehovah, for he gives thanks to God; and the one who does not eat does not eat to Jehovah, and yet gives thanks to God. 7 Not one of us, in fact, lives with regard to himself only, and no one dies with regard to himself only. 8 For if we live, we live to Jehovah, and if we die, we die to Jehovah. So both if we live and if we die, we belong to Jehovah. 9 For to this end Christ died and came to life again, so that he might be Lord over both the dead and the living.\n10 But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you also look down on your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 11 For it is written: \"'As surely as I live,' says Jehovah, 'to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will make open acknowledgment to God.'\" 12 So, then, each of us will render an account for himself to God.\n13 Therefore, let us not judge one another any longer but, rather, be determined not to put a stumbling block or an obstacle before a brother. 14 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; only where a man considers something to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 15 For if your brother is being offended because of food, you are no longer walking according to love. Do not by your food ruin that one for whom Christ died. 16 Therefore, do not let the good you do be spoken of as bad. 17 For the Kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking, but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit. 18 For whoever slaves for Christ in this way is acceptable to God and has approval with men.\n19 So, then, let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up. 20 Stop tearing down the work of God just for the sake of food. True, all things are clean, but it is detrimental for a man to eat when it will cause stumbling. 21 It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles. 22 The faith that you have, keep it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who does not judge himself by what he approves. 23 But if he has doubts, he is already condemned if he eats, because he does not eat based on faith. Indeed, everything that is not based on faith is sin.\nChapter 15\n1 We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves. 2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 3 For even the Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written: \"The reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me.\" 4 For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope. 5 Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had, 6 so that unitedly you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n7 So welcome one another, just as the Christ also welcomed you, with glory to God in view. 8 For I tell you that Christ became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God's truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers, 9 and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: \"That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations, and to your name I will sing praises.\" 10 And again he says: \"Be glad, you nations, with his people.\" 11 And again: \"Praise Jehovah, all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.\" 12 And again Isaiah says: \"There will be the root of Jesse, the one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.\" 13 May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in him, so that you may abound in hope with power of holy spirit.\n14 Now I myself am convinced about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are also full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and that you are able to admonish one another. 15 However, I have written to you more outspokenly on some points, so as to give you another reminder, because of the undeserved kindness given to me from God 16 for me to be a public servant of Christ Jesus to the nations. I am engaging in the holy work of the good news of God, so that these nations might be an acceptable offering, sanctified with holy spirit.\n17 So I have reason to exult in Christ Jesus over the things pertaining to God. 18 For I will not presume to speak about anything except what Christ has done through me in order for the nations to be obedient, by my word and deed, 19 with the power of signs and wonders, with the power of God's spirit, so that from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ. 20 In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where the name of Christ had already been made known, so as not to build on another man's foundation; 21 but just as it is written: \"Those who received no report about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.\"\n22 This is also why I was many times hindered from coming to you. 23 But now I no longer have untouched territory in these regions, and for many years I have longed to come to you. 24 Therefore, when I journey to Spain, I hope that I will see you and be accompanied partway there by you after I have first enjoyed your company for a time. 25 But now I am about to travel to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones. 26 For those in Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to share their things by a contribution to the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem. 27 True, they have been pleased to do so, and indeed they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, they also owe it to minister to them with their material things. 28 So after I have finished with this and have delivered this contribution securely to them, I will depart by way of you for Spain. 29 Moreover, I know that when I do come to you, I will come with a full measure of blessing from Christ.\n30 Now I urge you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the spirit, that you exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me, 31 that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my ministry in behalf of Jerusalem may prove to be acceptable to the holy ones, 32 so that by God's will I will come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you. 33 May the God who gives peace be with all of you. Amen.\nChapter 16\n1 I am introducing to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a minister of the congregation that is in Cenchreae, 2 so that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the holy ones and give her whatever help she may need, for she herself also proved to be a defender of many, including me.\n3 Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 4 who have risked their own necks for me and to whom not only I but also all the congregations of the nations give thanks. 5 Also greet the congregation that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is a firstfruits of Asia for Christ. 6 Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you. 7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and fellow prisoners, who are men well-known to the apostles and who have been in union with Christ longer than I have.\n8 Give my greetings to Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. 9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys. 10 Greet Apelles, the approved one in Christ. Greet those from the household of Aristobulus. 11 Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those from the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord. 12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, women who are working hard in the Lord. Greet Persis, our beloved one, for she has worked hard in the Lord. 13 Greet Rufus, the chosen one in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them. 15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them. 16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the congregations of the Christ greet you.\n17 Now I urge you, brothers, to keep your eye on those who create divisions and causes for stumbling contrary to the teaching that you have learned, and avoid them. 18 For men of that sort are slaves, not of our Lord Christ, but of their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattering speech they seduce the hearts of unsuspecting ones. 19 Your obedience has come to the notice of all, and so I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise as to what is good, but innocent as to what is evil. 20 For his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. May the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus be with you.\n21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, and so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.\n22 I, Tertius, who have done the writing of this letter, greet you in the Lord.\n23 Gaius, host to me and to all the congregation, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you, and so does Quartus, his brother. 24 --\n25 Now to Him who can make you firm according to the good news I declare and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the sacred secret that has been kept in silence for long-lasting times 26 but has now been made manifest and has been made known through the prophetic Scriptures among all the nations according to the command of the everlasting God to promote obedience by faith; 27 to God, who alone is wise, be the glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen. \n",

    "text": "First Corinthians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, and Sosthenes our brother, 2 to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, to you who have been sanctified in union with Christ Jesus, called to be holy ones, together with all those everywhere who are calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:\n3 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n4 I always thank my God for you in view of the undeserved kindness of God given to you in Christ Jesus; 5 because in everything you have been enriched in him, in full ability to speak and in full knowledge, 6 just as the witness about the Christ has been made firm among you, 7 so that you do not lack in any gift at all, while you are eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. 8 He will also make you firm to the end so that you may be open to no accusation in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.\n10 Now I urge you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you should all speak in agreement and that there should be no divisions among you, but that you may be completely united in the same mind and in the same line of thought. 11 For some from the house of Chloe have informed me regarding you, my brothers, that there are dissensions among you. 12 What I mean is this, that each one of you says: \"I belong to Paul,\" \"But I to Apollos,\" \"But I to Cephas,\" \"But I to Christ.\" 13 Is the Christ divided? Paul was not executed on the stake for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. 16 Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. As for the rest, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else. 17 For Christ sent me, not to baptize, but to declare the good news; and not with wisdom of speech, so that the torture stake of the Christ should not be made useless.\n18 For the speech about the torture stake is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is God's power. 19 For it is written: \"I will make the wisdom of the wise men perish, and the intelligence of the intellectuals I will reject.\" 20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this system of things? Has not God made the wisdom of the world foolish? 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not get to know God through its wisdom, God was pleased through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing.\n22 For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks look for wisdom; 23 but we preach Christ executed on the stake, to the Jews a cause for stumbling but to the nations foolishness. 24 However, to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 Because a foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than men.\n26 For you see his calling of you, brothers, that there are not many wise in a fleshly way, not many powerful, not many of noble birth, 27 but God chose the foolish things of the world to put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world to put the strong things to shame; 28 and God chose the insignificant things of the world and the things looked down on, the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 29 so that no one might boast in the sight of God. 30 But it is due to him that you are in union with Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God, also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom, 31 so that it may be just as it is written: \"The one who boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.\"\nChapter 2\n1 So when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with extravagant speech or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to you. 2 For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and him executed on the stake. 3 And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling; 4 and my speech and what I preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a demonstration of spirit and power, 5 so that your faith might be, not in men's wisdom, but in God's power.\n6 Now we speak wisdom among those who are mature, but not the wisdom of this system of things nor that of the rulers of this system of things, who are to come to nothing. 7 But we speak God's wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things for our glory. 8 It is this wisdom that none of the rulers of this system of things came to know, for if they had known it, they would not have executed the glorious Lord. 9 But just as it is written: \"Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, nor have there been conceived in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those who love him.\" 10 For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.\n11 For who among men knows the things of a man except the man's spirit within him? So, too, no one has come to know the things of God except the spirit of God. 12 Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit that is from God, so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God. 13 These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, as we explain spiritual matters with spiritual words.\n14 But a physical man does not accept the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know them, because they are examined spiritually. 15 However, the spiritual man examines all things, but he himself is not examined by any man. 16 For \"who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, so that he may instruct him?\" But we do have the mind of Christ.\nChapter 3\n1 So, brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshly men, as to infants in Christ. 2 I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet strong enough. In fact, neither are you strong enough now, 3 for you are still fleshly. Since there are jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and are you not walking as men do? 4 For when one says, \"I belong to Paul,\" but another says, \"I to Apollos,\" are you not acting like mere men?\n5 What, then, is Apollos? Yes, what is Paul? Ministers through whom you became believers, just as the Lord granted each one. 6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow, 7 so that neither is the one who plants anything nor is the one who waters, but God who makes it grow. 8 Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each person will receive his own reward according to his own work. 9 For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field under cultivation, God's building.\n10 According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me, I laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, but someone else is building on it. But let each one keep watching how he is building on it. 11 For no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, 13 each one's work will be shown for what it is, for the day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire, and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one has built. 14 If anyone's work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward; 15 if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved; yet, if so, it will be as through fire.\n16 Do you not know that you yourselves are God's temple and that the spirit of God dwells in you? 17 If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.\n18 Let no one deceive himself: If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this system of things, let him become a fool, so that he may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written: \"He catches the wise in their own cunning.\" 20 And again: \"Jehovah knows that the reasonings of the wise men are futile.\" 21 So let no one boast in men; for all things belong to you, 22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things now here or things to come, all things belong to you; 23 in turn you belong to Christ; Christ, in turn, belongs to God.\nChapter 4\n1 A man should regard us as attendants of Christ and stewards of God's sacred secrets. 2 In this regard, what is expected of stewards is that they be found faithful. 3 Now to me it is of very little importance to be examined by you or by a human tribunal. In fact, I do not even examine myself. 4 For I am not conscious of anything against myself. But by this I am not proved righteous; the one who examines me is Jehovah. 5 Therefore, do not judge anything before the due time, until the Lord comes. He will bring the secret things of darkness to light and make known the intentions of the hearts, and then each one will receive his praise from God.\n6 Now, brothers, these things I have applied to myself and Apollos for your good, that through us you may learn the rule: \"Do not go beyond the things that are written,\" so that you may not be puffed up with pride, favoring one against the other. 7 For who makes you different from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?\n8 Are you already satisfied? Are you already rich? Have you begun ruling as kings without us? I really wish that you had begun ruling as kings, so that we also might rule with you as kings. 9 For it seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition as men condemned to death, because we have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men. 10 We are fools because of Christ, but you are discreet in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are held in honor, but we in dishonor. 11 Down to this very hour we continue to hunger and thirst and to be poorly clothed and to be beaten and to be homeless 12 and to toil, working with our own hands. When insulted, we bless; when persecuted, we patiently endure; 13 when slandered, we answer mildly; we have become as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.\n14 I am writing these things, not to put you to shame, but to admonish you as my beloved children. 15 For though you may have 10,000 guardians in Christ, you certainly do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, I have become your father through the good news. 16 I urge you, therefore, become imitators of me. 17 That is why I am sending Timothy to you, because he is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus, just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation.\n18 Some are puffed up with pride, as though I were not coming to you. 19 But I will come to you shortly, if Jehovah wills, and I will get to know, not the speech of those who are puffed up with pride, but their power. 20 For the Kingdom of God is a matter not of speech but of power. 21 Which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and mildness of spirit?\nChapter 5\n1 Actually sexual immorality is reported among you, and such immorality as is not even found among the nations-of a man living with his father's wife. 2 And are you proud of it? Should you not rather mourn, so that the man who committed this deed should be taken away from your midst? 3 Although absent in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already judged the man who has done this, as if I were actually with you. 4 When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and knowing that I am with you in spirit along with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5 you must hand such a man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.\n6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough? 7 Clear away the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, inasmuch as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed. 8 So, then, let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\n9 In my letter I wrote you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people, 10 not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, you would actually have to get out of the world. 11 But now I am writing you to stop keeping company with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. 12 For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do you not judge those inside, 13 while God judges those outside? \"Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.\"\nChapter 6\n1 Does any one of you who has a dispute with another dare to go to court before unrighteous men, and not before the holy ones? 2 Or do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try very trivial matters? 3 Do you not know that we will judge angels? Then why not matters of this life? 4 If, then, you do have matters of this life to be tried, is it the men looked down on in the congregation whom you assign as judges? 5 I am speaking to move you to shame. Is there not one wise man among you who is able to judge between his brothers? 6 Instead, brother goes to court against brother, and before unbelievers at that!\n7 Really, it is already a defeat for you when you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded? 8 Instead, you wrong and defraud, and your brothers at that!\n9 Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God's Kingdom? Do not be misled. Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts, men who practice homosexuality, 10 thieves, greedy people, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners will not inherit God's Kingdom. 11 And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean; you have been sanctified; you have been declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.\n12 All things are lawful for me, but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful for me, but I will not let myself be controlled by anything. 13 Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will bring both of them to nothing. The body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 14 But God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up out of death through his power.\n15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I, then, take the members of the Christ away and join them to a prostitute? By no means! 16 Do you not know that anyone who is joined to a prostitute is one body with her? For \"the two,\" says he, \"will be one flesh.\" 17 But whoever is joined to the Lord is one with him in spirit. 18 Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body. 19 Do you not know that your body is the temple of the holy spirit within you, which you have from God? Also, you do not belong to yourselves, 20 for you were bought with a price. By all means, glorify God in your body.\nChapter 7\n1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is better for a man not to touch a woman; 2 but because of the prevalence of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife and each woman have her own husband. 3 Let the husband give to his wife her due, and let the wife also do likewise to her husband. 4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does; likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does. 5 Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent for an appointed time, so that you may devote time to prayer and may come together again, in order that Satan may not keep tempting you for your lack of self-control. 6 However, I say this by way of concession, not as a command. 7 But I wish all men were as I am. Nevertheless, each one has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that way.\n8 Now I say to those who are unmarried and to the widows that it is better for them if they remain as I am. 9 But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion.\n10 To the married people I give instructions, not I but the Lord, that a wife should not separate from her husband. 11 But if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled with her husband; and a husband should not leave his wife.\n12 But to the others I say, yes, I, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is agreeable to staying with him, let him not leave her; 13 and if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is agreeable to staying with her, let her not leave her husband. 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in relation to his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in relation to the brother; otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. 15 But if the unbelieving one chooses to depart, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not bound under such circumstances, but God has called you to peace. 16 For wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Or, husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?\n17 Nevertheless, just as Jehovah has given each one a portion, let each one so walk as God has called him. And so I give this directive in all the congregations. 18 Was any man already circumcised when he was called? Let him not undo his circumcision. Has any man been called while uncircumcised? Let him not get circumcised. 19 Circumcision means nothing, and uncircumcision means nothing; what means something is the observing of God's commandments. 20 In whatever state each one was called, let him remain in it. 21 Were you called when a slave? Do not let it concern you; but if you can become free, then seize the opportunity. 22 For anyone who was called in the Lord when a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise anyone who was called when a freeman is a slave of Christ. 23 You were bought with a price; stop becoming slaves of men. 24 In whatever state each one was called, brothers, let him remain in it before God.\n25 Now concerning virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who had mercy shown him by the Lord to be faithful. 26 Therefore, I think that it is best for a man to continue as he is in view of the present difficulty. 27 Are you bound to a wife? Stop seeking a release. Are you freed from a wife? Stop seeking a wife. 28 But even if you did marry, you would commit no sin. And if a virgin married, such a person would commit no sin. However, those who do will have tribulation in their flesh. But I am trying to spare you.\n29 Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced. From now on, let those who have wives be as though they had none, 30 and those who weep as those who do not weep, and those who rejoice as those who do not rejoice, and those who buy as those who do not possess, 31 and those making use of the world as those not using it to the full; for the scene of this world is changing. 32 Indeed, I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he may gain the Lord's approval. 33 But the married man is anxious for the things of the world, how he may gain the approval of his wife, 34 and he is divided. Further, the unmarried woman, as well as the virgin, is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit. However, the married woman is anxious for the things of the world, how she may gain the approval of her husband. 35 But I am saying this for your personal advantage, not to restrict you, but to move you to what is appropriate and to constant devotion to the Lord without distraction.\n36 But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly by remaining unmarried, and if he is past the bloom of youth, then this is what should take place: Let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry. 37 But if anyone stands settled in his heart and has no necessity, but has authority over his own will and has made the decision in his own heart to remain unmarried, he will do well. 38 So also, whoever marries does well, but whoever does not marry will do better.\n39 A wife is bound as long as her husband is alive. But if her husband should fall asleep in death, she is free to be married to whomever she wants, only in the Lord. 40 But in my opinion, she is happier if she remains as she is; and I certainly think I also have God's spirit.\nChapter 8\n1 Now concerning food offered to idols: We know we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 2 If anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know it as he should know it. 3 But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.\n4 Now concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one. 5 For even though there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many \"gods\" and many \"lords,\" 6 there is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and we through him.\n7 However, not all have this knowledge. But some, because of their former association with the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 8 But food will not bring us nearer to God; we are no worse off if we do not eat, nor better off if we eat. 9 But keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak. 10 For if anyone should see you who have knowledge having a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be emboldened to the point of eating food offered to idols? 11 So by your knowledge the man who is weak is being ruined, your brother for whose sake Christ died. 12 When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ. 13 That is why if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat at all, so that I will not make my brother stumble.\nChapter 9\n1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 2 Even if I am not an apostle to others, I most certainly am to you! For you are the seal confirming my apostleship in the Lord.\n3 My defense to those who examine me is as follows: 4 We have the right to eat and drink, do we not? 5 We have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as the rest of the apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas, do we not? 6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have the right to refrain from working for a living? 7 What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not partake of some of the milk of the flock?\n8 Am I saying these things from a human viewpoint? Or does not the Law also say these things? 9 For it is written in the Law of Moses: \"You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain.\" Is it bulls that God is concerned about? 10 Or is it actually for our sakes that he says it? It was really written for our sakes, because the man who plows and the man who threshes ought to do so in the hope of receiving a share.\n11 If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material support from you? 12 If other men have this rightful claim over you, do we not have it much more so? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we are enduring all things so that we might not in any way hinder the good news about the Christ. 13 Do you not know that the men performing sacred duties eat the things of the temple, and that those regularly serving at the altar receive a share from the altar? 14 In this way, too, the Lord commanded for those proclaiming the good news to live by means of the good news.\n15 But I have not made use of a single one of these provisions. Indeed, I have not written these things so that this would be done for me, for it would be better to die than-no man will take away my grounds for boasting! 16 Now if I am declaring the good news, it is no reason for me to boast, for necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe to me if I do not declare the good news! 17 If I do this willingly, I have a reward; but even if I do it against my will, I still have a stewardship entrusted to me. 18 What, then, is my reward? That when I declare the good news, I may offer the good news without cost, to avoid abusing my authority in the good news.\n19 For though I am free from all people, I have made myself the slave to all, so that I may gain as many people as possible. 20 To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to gain Jews; to those under law I became as under law, though I myself am not under law, in order to gain those under law. 21 To those without law I became as without law, although I am not without law toward God but under law toward Christ, in order to gain those without law. 22 To the weak I became weak, in order to gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, so that I might by all possible means save some. 23 But I do all things for the sake of the good news, in order to share it with others.\n24 Do you not know that the runners in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win it. 25 Now everyone competing in a contest exercises self-control in all things. Of course, they do it to receive a crown that can perish, but we, one that does not perish. 26 Therefore, the way I am running is not aimlessly; the way I am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air; 27 but I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.\nChapter 10\n1 Now I want you to know, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea 2 and all got baptized into Moses by means of the cloud and of the sea, 3 and all ate the same spiritual food 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they used to drink from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock meant the Christ. 5 Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.\n6 Now these things became examples for us, in order for us not to desire injurious things, as they desired them. 7 Neither become idolaters, as some of them did; just as it is written: \"The people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up to have a good time.\" 8 Neither let us practice sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, only to fall, 23,000 of them in one day. 9 Neither let us put Jehovah to the test, as some of them put him to the test, only to perish by the serpents. 10 Neither be murmurers, as some of them murmured, only to perish by the destroyer. 11 Now these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have come.\n12 So let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall. 13 No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.\n14 Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry. 15 I speak as to men with discernment; judge for yourselves what I say. 16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ? The loaf that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of the Christ? 17 Because there is one loaf, we, although many, are one body, for we are all partaking of that one loaf.\n18 Look at Israel in the fleshly sense: Are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers with the altar? 19 What, then, am I saying? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? 20 No; but I say that what the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become sharers with the demons. 21 You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; you cannot be partaking of \"the table of Jehovah\" and the table of demons. 22 Or 'are we inciting Jehovah to jealousy'? We are not stronger than he is, are we?\n23 All things are lawful, but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. 24 Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.\n25 Eat whatever is sold in a meat market, making no inquiry because of your conscience, 26 for \"to Jehovah belong the earth and everything in it.\" 27 If an unbeliever invites you and you want to go, eat whatever is set before you, making no inquiry on account of your conscience. 28 But if anyone says to you, \"This is something offered in sacrifice,\" do not eat because of the one who told you and because of conscience. 29 I do not mean your own conscience, but that of the other person. For why should my freedom be judged by another person's conscience? 30 If I am partaking with thanks, why am I to be spoken of abusively over that for which I give thanks?\n31 Therefore, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God's glory. 32 Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God, 33 just as I am trying to please all people in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, so that they may be saved.\nChapter 11\n1 Become imitators of me, just as I am of Christ.\n2 I commend you because in all things you remember me and you are holding fast the traditions just as I handed them on to you. 3 But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God. 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head shames his head; 5 but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a woman with a shaved head. 6 For if a woman does not cover herself, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, she should be covered.\n7 For a man should not have his head covered, as he is God's image and glory, but the woman is man's glory. 8 For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man. 9 And what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. 10 That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.\n11 Besides, in connection with the Lord, neither is woman separate from man nor is man separate from woman. 12 For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman; but all things are from God. 13 Judge for yourselves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14 Does not nature itself teach you that long hair is a dishonor to a man, 15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her instead of a covering. 16 However, if anyone wants to argue in favor of some other custom, we have no other, nor do the congregations of God.\n17 But while giving these instructions, I do not commend you, because it is, not for the better, but for the worse that you meet together. 18 For first of all, I hear that when you come together in a congregation, divisions exist among you; and to an extent I believe it. 19 For there will certainly also be sects among you, so that those of you who are approved may also become evident.\n20 When you come together in one place, it is not really to eat the Lord's Evening Meal. 21 For when you eat it, each one takes his own evening meal beforehand, so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated. 22 Do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the congregation of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed? What can I say to you? Should I commend you? In this I do not commend you.\n23 For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night on which he was going to be betrayed took a loaf, 24 and after giving thanks, he broke it and said: \"This means my body, which is in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.\" 25 He did the same with the cup also, after they had the evening meal, saying: \"This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood. Keep doing this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" 26 For whenever you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he comes.\n27 Therefore, whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord. 28 First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, and only then let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup. 29 For the one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment against himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and quite a few are sleeping in death. 31 But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged. 32 However, when we are judged, we are disciplined by Jehovah, so that we may not become condemned with the world. 33 Consequently, my brothers, when you come together to eat it, wait for one another. 34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come together it is not for judgment. But as for the remaining matters, I will put them in order when I get there.\nChapter 12\n1 Now concerning the spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were people of the nations, you were influenced and led astray to those voiceless idols, following wherever they might lead you. 3 Now I would have you know that nobody when speaking by God's spirit says: \"Jesus is accursed!\" and nobody can say: \"Jesus is Lord!\" except by holy spirit.\n4 Now there are different gifts, but there is the same spirit; 5 and there are different ministries, and yet there is the same Lord; 6 and there are different activities, and yet it is the same God who performs them all in everyone. 7 But the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose. 8 For to one is given speech of wisdom through the spirit, to another speech of knowledge according to the same spirit, 9 to another faith by the same spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one spirit, 10 to yet another operations of powerful works, to another prophesying, to another discernment of inspired expressions, to another different tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues. 11 But all these operations are performed by the very same spirit, distributing to each one respectively just as it wills.\n12 For just as the body is one but has many members, and all the members of that body, although many, are one body, so too is the Christ. 13 For by one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink one spirit.\n14 For, indeed, the body is made up not of one member but of many. 15 If the foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand, I am no part of the body,\" that does not make it no part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye, I am no part of the body,\" that does not make it no part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But now God has arranged each of the body members just as he pleased.\n19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 20 But now they are many members, yet one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I do not need you,\" or again, the head cannot say to the feet, \"I do not need you.\" 22 On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary, 23 and the parts of the body that we think to be less honorable we surround with greater honor, so our unseemly parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 whereas our attractive parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that had a lack, 25 so that there should be no division in the body, but its members should have mutual concern for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it; or if a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it.\n27 Now you are Christ's body, and each of you individually is a member. 28 And God has assigned the respective ones in the congregation: first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then powerful works; then gifts of healings; helpful services; abilities to direct; different tongues. 29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform powerful works, do they? 30 Not all have gifts of healings, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all are interpreters, are they? 31 But keep striving for the greater gifts. And yet I will show you a surpassing way.\nChapter 13\n1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a clanging gong or a clashing cymbal. 2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 3 And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I do not benefit at all.\n4 Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, does not get puffed up, 5 does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. 6 It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. 7 It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\n8 Love never fails. But if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away with; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away with. 9 For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially, 10 but when what is complete comes, what is partial will be done away with. 11 When I was a child, I used to speak as a child, to think as a child, to reason as a child; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a child. 12 For now we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face-to-face. At present I know partially, but then I will know accurately, just as I am accurately known. 13 Now, however, these three remain: faith, hope, love; but the greatest of these is love.\nChapter 14\n1 Pursue love, yet keep striving for the spiritual gifts, but preferably that you may prophesy. 2 For the one who speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God, for no one listens, but he speaks sacred secrets by the spirit. 3 However, the one who prophesies builds up and encourages and consoles men by his speech. 4 The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up a congregation. 5 Now I would like for all of you to speak in tongues, but I prefer that you prophesy. Indeed, the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the congregation may be built up. 6 But at this time, brothers, if I should come speaking to you in tongues, what good would I do you unless I spoke to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?\n7 It is the same with the inanimate things that produce sound, whether a flute or a harp. Unless there is an interval to the tones, how can what is being played on the flute or on the harp be recognized? 8 For if the trumpet sounds an indistinct call, who will get ready for battle? 9 In the same way, unless you with the tongue use speech that is easily understood, how will anyone know what is being said? You will, in fact, be speaking into the air. 10 It may be that there are many kinds of speech in the world, and yet no kind is without meaning. 11 For if I do not understand the sense of the speech, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me. 12 So also with you, since you eagerly desire the gifts of the spirit, seek to abound in gifts that will build up the congregation.\n13 Therefore, let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 14 For if I am praying in a tongue, it is my gift of the spirit that is praying, but my mind is unproductive. 15 What is to be done, then? I will pray with the gift of the spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with the gift of the spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind. 16 Otherwise, if you offer praise with a gift of the spirit, how will the ordinary person in your midst say \"Amen\" to your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying? 17 True, you are giving thanks in a fine way, but the other man is not being built up. 18 I thank God that I speak in more tongues than all of you do. 19 Nevertheless, in a congregation I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might also instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.\n20 Brothers, do not become young children in your understanding, but be young children as to badness; and become full-grown in your understanding. 21 In the Law it is written: \"'With the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and even then they will refuse to listen to me,' says Jehovah.\" 22 Therefore, tongues are not a sign for the believers but for the unbelievers, whereas prophecy is not for the unbelievers but for the believers. 23 So if the whole congregation comes together to one place and they all speak in tongues, but ordinary people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you have lost your minds? 24 But if you are all prophesying and an unbeliever or an ordinary person comes in, he will be reproved and closely examined by them all. 25 The secrets of his heart then become evident, so that he will fall facedown and worship God, declaring: \"God is really among you.\"\n26 What is to be done, then, brothers? When you come together, one has a psalm, another has a teaching, another has a revelation, another has a tongue, and another has an interpretation. Let all things take place for building up. 27 And if someone speaks in a tongue, let it be limited to two or three at the most, and in turns, and someone must interpret. 28 But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the congregation and speak to himself and to God. 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern the meaning. 30 But if another one receives a revelation while sitting there, let the first speaker keep silent. 31 For you can all prophesy one at a time, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged. 32 And gifts of the spirit of the prophets are to be controlled by the prophets. 33 For God is a God not of disorder but of peace.\nAs in all the congregations of the holy ones, 34 let the women keep silent in the congregations, for it is not permitted for them to speak. Rather, let them be in subjection, as the Law also says. 35 If they want to learn something, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the congregation.\n36 Was it from you that the word of God originated, or did it reach only as far as you?\n37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or is gifted with the spirit, he must acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are the Lord's commandment. 38 But if anyone disregards this, he will be disregarded. 39 So, my brothers, keep striving to prophesy, and yet do not forbid the speaking in tongues. 40 But let all things take place decently and by arrangement.\nChapter 15\n1 Now I remind you, brothers, of the good news that I declared to you, which you also accepted, and for which you have taken your stand. 2 Through it you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the good news I declared to you, unless you became believers for nothing.\n3 For among the first things I handed on to you was what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; 4 and that he was buried, yes, that he was raised up on the third day according to the Scriptures; 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still with us, though some have fallen asleep in death. 7 After that he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. 8 But last of all he appeared also to me as if to one born prematurely.\n9 For I am the least of the apostles, and I am not worthy of being called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation of God. 10 But by God's undeserved kindness I am what I am. And his undeserved kindness to me was not in vain, but I labored more than all of them; yet it was not I, but the undeserved kindness of God that is with me. 11 Whether, then, it is I or they, this is the way we preach, and this is the way you believed.\n12 Now if it is being preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 If, indeed, there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised up. 14 But if Christ has not been raised up, our preaching is certainly in vain, and your faith is also in vain. 15 Moreover, we are also found to be false witnesses of God, because we have given witness against God by saying that he raised up the Christ, whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up. 16 For if the dead are not to be raised up, neither has Christ been raised up. 17 Further, if Christ has not been raised up, your faith is useless; you remain in your sins. 18 Then also those who have fallen asleep in death in union with Christ have perished. 19 If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are to be pitied more than anyone.\n20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death. 21 For since death came through a man, resurrection of the dead also comes through a man. 22 For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive. 23 But each one in his own proper order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence. 24 Next, the end, when he hands over the Kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power. 25 For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. 26 And the last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing. 27 For God \"subjected all things under his feet.\" But when he says that 'all things have been subjected,' it is evident that this does not include the One who subjected all things to him. 28 But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.\n29 Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of being dead ones? If the dead are not to be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of being such? 30 Why are we also in danger every hour? 31 Daily I face death. This is as sure as my exultation over you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. 32 If like other men, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, of what good is it to me? If the dead are not to be raised up, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.\" 33 Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits. 34 Come to your senses in a righteous way and do not practice sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I am speaking to move you to shame.\n35 Nevertheless, someone will say: \"How are the dead to be raised up? Yes, with what sort of body are they coming?\" 36 You unreasonable person! What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies. 37 And as for what you sow, you sow, not the body that will develop, but just a bare grain, whether of wheat or of some other kind of seed; 38 but God gives it a body just as it has pleased him, and gives to each of the seeds its own body. 39 Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, there is another flesh of cattle, another flesh of birds, and another of fish. 40 And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort. 41 The glory of the sun is one sort, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is another; in fact, one star differs from another star in glory.\n42 So it is with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised up in incorruption. 43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised up in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised up in power. 44 It is sown a physical body; it is raised up a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one. 45 So it is written: \"The first man Adam became a living person.\" The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. 46 However, what is spiritual is not first. What is physical is first, and afterward what is spiritual. 47 The first man is from the earth and made of dust; the second man is from heaven. 48 Like the one made of dust, so too are those made of dust; and like the heavenly one, so too are those who are heavenly. 49 And just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we will bear also the image of the heavenly one.\n50 But I tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's Kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruption. 51 Look! I tell you a sacred secret: We will not all fall asleep in death, but we will all be changed, 52 in a moment, in the blink of an eye, during the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we will be changed. 53 For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality. 54 But when this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: \"Death is swallowed up forever.\" 55 \"Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?\" 56 The sting producing death is sin, and the power for sin is the Law. 57 But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!\n58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.\nChapter 16\n1 Now concerning the collection for the holy ones, you may follow the directions I gave to the congregations of Galatia. 2 On the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside according to his own means, so that collections will not take place when I arrive. 3 But when I get there, I will send the men you approve of in your letters to take your kind gift to Jerusalem. 4 However, if it seems advisable for me to go there also, they will go there with me.\n5 But I will come to you when I have gone through Macedonia, for I will be going through Macedonia; 6 and perhaps I will stay or even spend the winter with you, so that you may accompany me partway to where I may be going. 7 For I do not want to see you now just in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if Jehovah permits. 8 But I am remaining in Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost, 9 because a large door that leads to activity has been opened to me, but there are many opposers.\n10 Now if Timothy arrives, make sure that he has nothing to fear while among you, for he is performing the work of Jehovah, just as I am. 11 Therefore, let no one look down on him. Send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am waiting for him together with the brothers.\n12 Now concerning Apollos our brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers. It was not his intention to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.\n13 Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on in a manly way, grow mighty. 14 Let everything you do be done with love.\n15 Now I urge you, brothers: You know that the household of Stephanas is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they devoted themselves to ministering to the holy ones. 16 May you also keep submitting yourselves to people like that and to all those cooperating and working hard. 17 But I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your not being here. 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, give recognition to men of that sort.\n19 The congregations of Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca together with the congregation that is in their house greet you heartily in the Lord. 20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.\n21 Here is my greeting, Paul's, in my own hand.\n22 If anyone has no affection for the Lord, let him be accursed. O our Lord, come! 23 May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with you. 24 May my love be with all of you in union with Christ Jesus. \n",

    "text": "Second Corinthians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God's will, and Timothy our brother, to the congregation of God that is in Corinth, including all the holy ones who are in all Achaia:\n2 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n3 Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God. 5 For just as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so the comfort we receive through the Christ also abounds. 6 Now if we face trials, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are being comforted, it is for your comfort, which acts to help you to endure the same sufferings that we also suffer. 7 And our hope for you is unwavering, knowing as we do that just as you share in the sufferings, so you will also share in the comfort.\n8 For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the tribulation we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under extreme pressure beyond our own strength, so that we were very uncertain even of our lives. 9 In fact, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. This was so that we would trust, not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead. 10 From such a great risk of death he did rescue us and will rescue us, and our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us. 11 You also can help us by your supplication for us, in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers of many.\n12 For the thing we boast of is this, our conscience bears witness that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but with God's undeserved kindness. 13 For we are really not writing you about anything except what you can read and understand, and I hope you will continue to understand these things fully, 14 just as you have also understood to an extent that we are a cause for you to boast, just as you will also be for us in the day of our Lord Jesus.\n15 So with this confidence, I was intending to come first to you, so that you might have a second occasion for joy; 16 for I intended to visit you on my way to Macedonia, to return to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me off to Judea. 17 Well, when I had such an intention, I did not view the matter lightly, did I? Or do I purpose things in a fleshly way, so that I am saying \"Yes, yes\" and then \"No, no\"? 18 But God can be relied on that what we say to you is not \"yes\" and yet \"no.\" 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, that is, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become \"yes\" and yet \"no,\" but \"yes\" has become \"yes\" in his case. 20 For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become \"yes\" by means of him. Therefore, also through him is the \"Amen\" said to God, which brings him glory through us. 21 But the one who guarantees that you and we belong to Christ and the one who anointed us is God. 22 He has also put his seal on us and has given us the token of what is to come, that is, the spirit, in our hearts.\n23 Now I call on God as a witness against me that it is to spare you that I have not yet come to Corinth. 24 Not that we are the masters over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, for it is by your faith that you are standing.\nChapter 2\n1 For I have made up my mind not to come to you again in sadness. 2 For if I make you sad, who will be there to cheer me up except the one I saddened? 3 I wrote what I did, so that when I come I may not be saddened by those over whom I ought to rejoice, because I have confidence that what brings me joy brings all of you the same joy. 4 For out of much tribulation and anguish of heart I wrote you with many tears, not to sadden you, but to let you know the depth of love I have for you.\n5 Now if anyone has caused sadness, he has saddened, not me, but all of you to an extent-not to be too harsh in what I say. 6 This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man; 7 now you should instead kindly forgive and comfort him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sadness. 8 I therefore exhort you to confirm your love for him. 9 For this is also why I wrote to you: to determine whether you would give proof of your obedience in all things. 10 If you forgive anyone for anything, I do also. In fact, whatever I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything) has been for your sake in Christ's sight, 11 so that we may not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his designs.\n12 Now when I arrived in Troas to declare the good news about the Christ and a door was opened to me in the Lord, 13 my spirit felt no relief because of not finding Titus my brother. So I said good-bye to them and departed for Macedonia.\n14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in a triumphal procession in company with the Christ and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him in every place! 15 For to God we are a sweet fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; 16 to the latter ones an odor of death leading to death, to the former ones a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is adequately qualified for these things? 17 We are, for we are not peddlers of the word of God as many men are, but we speak in all sincerity as sent from God, yes, in the sight of God and in company with Christ.\nChapter 3\n1 Are we starting to recommend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some men, letters of recommendation to you or from you? 2 You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind. 3 For you are shown to be a letter of Christ written by us as ministers, inscribed not with ink but with the spirit of a living God, not on stone tablets but on fleshly tablets, on hearts.\n4 We have this sort of confidence toward God through the Christ. 5 Not that we of ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us, but our being adequately qualified comes from God, 6 who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, not of a written code, but of spirit; for the written code condemns to death, but the spirit makes alive.\n7 Now if the code that administers death and that was engraved in letters on stones came with such glory that the sons of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, a glory that was to be done away with, 8 why should the administering of the spirit not be with even greater glory? 9 For if the code administering condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious would be the administering of righteousness! 10 In fact, even what had once been made glorious has been stripped of glory because of the glory that excels it. 11 For if what was to be done away with was brought in with glory, how much greater would be the glory of what remains!\n12 Since we have such a hope, we are using great freeness of speech, 13 and not doing what Moses did when he would put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel might not gaze intently at the end of what was to be done away with. 14 But their minds were dulled. For to this present day, the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read, because it is taken away only by means of Christ. 15 In fact, to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their hearts. 16 But when one turns to Jehovah, the veil is taken away. 17 Now Jehovah is the Spirit, and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom. 18 And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, exactly as it is done by Jehovah the Spirit.\nChapter 4\n1 Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up. 2 But we have renounced the shameful, underhanded things, not walking with cunning or adulterating the word of God; but by making the truth manifest, we recommend ourselves to every human conscience in the sight of God. 3 If, in fact, the good news we declare is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, 4 among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through. 5 For we are preaching, not about ourselves, but about Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake. 6 For God is the one who said: \"Let the light shine out of darkness,\" and he has shone on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.\n7 However, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the power beyond what is normal may be God's and not from us. 8 We are hard-pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; 9 we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed. 10 Always we endure in our body the death-dealing treatment that Jesus suffered, that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our body. 11 For we who live are ever being brought face-to-face with death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 12 So death is at work in us, but life in you.\n13 Now because we have the same spirit of faith as that of which it is written: \"I exercised faith, therefore I spoke\"; we too exercise faith and therefore we speak, 14 knowing that the One who raised Jesus up will raise us up also with Jesus and will present us together with you. 15 For all these things are for your sake, so that the increase of the undeserved kindness should abound even more because many more are offering thanksgiving to the glory of God.\n16 Therefore, we do not give up, but even if the man we are outside is wasting away, certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day. 17 For though the tribulation is momentary and light, it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting; 18 while we keep our eyes, not on the things seen, but on the things unseen. For the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting.\nChapter 5\n1 For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, should be torn down, we are to have a building from God, a house not made with hands, everlasting in the heavens. 2 For in this house we do indeed groan, earnestly desiring to put on the one for us from heaven, 3 so that when we do put it on, we will not be found naked. 4 In fact, we who are in this tent groan, being weighed down, because we do not want to put this one off, but we want to put the other on, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. 5 Now the one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the spirit as a token of what is to come.\n6 So we are always of good courage and know that while we have our home in the body, we are absent from the Lord, 7 for we are walking by faith, not by sight. 8 But we are of good courage and would prefer to be absent from the body and to make our home with the Lord. 9 So whether at home with him or absent from him, we make it our aim to be acceptable to him. 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of the Christ, so that each one may be repaid according to the things he has practiced while in the body, whether good or bad.\n11 Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we keep persuading men, but we are well-known to God. However, I hope that we are well-known also to your consciences. 12 We are not recommending ourselves to you again but giving you an incentive to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast over the outward appearance but not over what is in the heart. 13 For if we were out of our mind, it was for God; if we are sound in mind, it is for you. 14 For the love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have concluded, that one man died for all; so, then, all had died. 15 And he died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised up.\n16 So from now on we know no man from a fleshly viewpoint. Even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh, we certainly no longer know him in that way. 17 Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new creation; the old things passed away; look! new things have come into existence. 18 But all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation, 19 namely, that God was by means of Christ reconciling a world to himself, not counting their offenses against them, and he entrusted to us the message of the reconciliation.\n20 Therefore, we are ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us. As substitutes for Christ, we beg: \"Become reconciled to God.\" 21 The one who did not know sin, he made to be sin for us, so that by means of him we might become God's righteousness.\nChapter 6\n1 Working together with him, we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose. 2 For he says: \"In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.\" Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation.\n3 In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, so that no fault may be found with our ministry; 4 but in every way we recommend ourselves as God's ministers, by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by times of need, by difficulties, 5 by beatings, by imprisonments, by riots, by hard work, by sleepless nights, by times without food; 6 by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by holy spirit, by love free from hypocrisy, 7 by truthful speech, by God's power; through the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left, 8 through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report. We are regarded as deceivers and yet we are truthful, 9 as unknown and yet we are recognized, as dying and yet look! we live, as punished and yet not handed over to death, 10 as sorrowing but ever rejoicing, as poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.\n11 We have opened our mouth to speak to you, Corinthians, and we have opened wide our heart. 12 We are not restricted in our affections for you, but you are restricted in your own tender affections for us. 13 So in response-I speak as to my children-you too open your hearts wide.\n14 Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness? 15 Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever? 16 And what agreement does God's temple have with idols? For we are a temple of a living God; just as God said: \"I will reside among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.\" 17 \"'Therefore, get out from among them, and separate yourselves,' says Jehovah, 'and quit touching the unclean thing'\"; \"'and I will take you in.'\" 18 \"'And I will become a father to you, and you will become sons and daughters to me,' says Jehovah, the Almighty.\"\nChapter 7\n1 Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\n2 Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. 3 I do not say this to condemn you. For I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together. 4 I have great freeness of speech toward you. I have great boasting in regard to you. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.\n5 In fact, when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies got no relief, but we continued to be afflicted in every way-there were fights on the outside, fears within. 6 But God, who comforts those who are downhearted, comforted us by the presence of Titus; 7 and not only by his presence but also by the comfort he received because of you, as he reported back to us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, and your earnest concern for me; so I rejoiced even more.\n8 For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did at first regret it (seeing that the letter saddened you, though only for a little while), 9 now I rejoice, not because you were just saddened, but because you were saddened into repenting. For you were saddened in a godly way, so that you suffered no harm because of us. 10 For sadness in a godly way produces repentance leading to salvation, leaving no regret; but the sadness of the world produces death. 11 For see what a great earnestness your being saddened in a godly way produced in you, yes, clearing of yourselves, yes, indignation, yes, fear, yes, earnest desire, yes, zeal, yes, righting of the wrong! In every respect you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in this matter. 12 Although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the one who did the wrong, nor for the one who was wronged, but so that your earnestness for us might be made evident among you in the sight of God. 13 That is why we have been comforted.\nBut in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced even more over the joy of Titus, because all of you refreshed his spirit. 14 For if I have boasted to him about you, I have not been put to shame; but just as all the things we told you were true, so also our boasting to Titus has proved true. 15 Also, his tender affections toward you are greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you, how you received him with fear and trembling. 16 I rejoice that in every way I may have confidence in you.\nChapter 8\n1 Now we want you to know, brothers, about the undeserved kindness of God that has been granted to the congregations of Macedonia. 2 During a great test under affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made the riches of their generosity abound. 3 For it was according to their means, yes, I testify, it was even beyond their means, 4 while they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving, to have a share in the relief ministry for the holy ones. 5 And not merely as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through God's will. 6 So we encouraged Titus that, just as he had initiated this work among you, he should also complete this same kind giving on your part. 7 Nevertheless, just as you abound in everything, in faith and word and knowledge and all earnestness and in our love for you, may you also abound in this kind giving.\n8 I am saying this, not to command you, but to make you aware of the earnestness of others and to test the genuineness of your love. 9 For you know the undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, he became poor for your sake, so that you might become rich through his poverty.\n10 And in this I give my opinion: This is for your benefit, seeing that already a year ago you not only initiated the action but also showed your desire to do it. 11 So now, also complete what you started to do, so that your readiness to act may be completed according to the means you have available. 12 For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have. 13 For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you; 14 but that by means of an equalizing, your surplus at the present time might offset their need, so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency, that there may be an equalizing. 15 Just as it is written: \"The person with much did not have too much, and the person with little did not have too little.\"\n16 Now thanks be to God for putting the same earnest concern for you in the heart of Titus, 17 because he has indeed responded to the encouragement, but being very eager, he is coming to you on his own initiative. 18 But we are sending along with him the brother whose praise in connection with the good news has spread through all the congregations. 19 Not only that, but he was also appointed by the congregations to be our traveling companion as we administer this kind gift for the glory of the Lord and in proof of our readiness to assist. 20 Thus we are avoiding having any man find fault with us in connection with this liberal contribution that we are administering. 21 For we 'care for everything honestly, not only in the sight of Jehovah but also in the sight of men.'\n22 Moreover, we are sending with them our brother whom we have often tested and found to be diligent in many matters, but now much more diligent on account of his great confidence in you. 23 If, though, there is any question about Titus, he is my companion and a fellow worker for your interests; or if there are questions about our brothers, they are apostles of congregations and a glory of Christ. 24 So demonstrate the proof of your love to them, and show the congregations why we boasted about you.\nChapter 9\n1 Now concerning the ministry that is for the holy ones, it is not really necessary for me to write you, 2 for I know your willingness about which I am boasting to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been ready now for a year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them. 3 But I am sending the brothers, so that our boasting about you might not prove empty in this respect and that you may really be ready, just as I said you would be. 4 Otherwise, if the Macedonians should come with me and find you not ready, we-not to mention you-should be put to shame by our confidence in you. 5 So I thought it necessary to encourage the brothers to come to you ahead of time and to get your promised bountiful gift ready in advance, so that this might be ready as a generous gift, and not as something extorted.\n6 But as to this, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\n8 Moreover, God is able to cause all his undeserved kindness to abound toward you so that you are always completely self-sufficient in everything, as well as having plenty for every good work. 9 (Just as it is written: \"He has distributed widely; he has given to the poor. His righteousness continues forever.\" 10 Now the One who abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the harvest of your righteousness.) 11 In everything you are being enriched for every sort of generosity, which produces through us an expression of thanks to God; 12 because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well for the needs of the holy ones but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to God. 13 Through the proof that this relief ministry gives, they glorify God because you are submissive to the good news about the Christ, as you publicly declared, and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all. 14 And with supplication for you, they express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you.\n15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift.\nChapter 10\n1 Now I myself, Paul, appeal to you by the mildness and kindness of the Christ, lowly though I am when among you face-to-face, but bold toward you when absent. 2 I beg that when present, I may not have to be bold and take the strong measures that I expect against some who view us as if we walked in a fleshly manner. 3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things. 5 For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ; 6 and we are prepared to inflict punishment for every disobedience, as soon as your own obedience is complete.\n7 You look at things according to their face value. If anyone is confident in himself that he belongs to Christ, let him reflect again on this fact: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we also. 8 For even if I should boast a bit too much about the authority that the Lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down, I would not be put to shame. 9 For I do not want to seem as though I were trying to terrify you by my letters. 10 For they say: \"His letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence in person is weak and his speech contemptible.\" 11 Let such a man consider that what we say by letters when absent, this we will also do when present. 12 For we do not dare to class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who recommend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.\n13 However, we will not boast outside our assigned boundaries, but within the boundary of the territory that God measured out to us, making it reach even as far as you. 14 Really, we are not overextending ourselves as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to reach as far as you with the good news about the Christ. 15 No, we are not boasting outside our assigned boundaries about the labors of someone else, but we hope that as your faith continues to increase, what we have done may be made to increase, within our territory. Then we will abound still more, 16 so that we may declare the good news to the countries beyond you, so as not to boast in what has already been done in someone else's territory. 17 \"But the one who boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.\" 18 For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved, but the one whom Jehovah recommends.\nChapter 11\n1 I wish you would put up with me in a little unreasonableness. But, in fact, you are putting up with me! 2 For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I personally promised you in marriage to one husband that I might present you as a chaste virgin to the Christ. 3 But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ. 4 For as it is, if someone comes and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or you receive a spirit other than what you received, or good news other than what you accepted, you easily put up with him. 5 For I consider that I have not proved inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing. 6 But even if I am unskilled in speech, I certainly am not in knowledge; indeed we made it clear to you in every way and in everything.\n7 Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I gladly declared the good news of God to you without cost? 8 Other congregations I deprived by accepting provisions in order to minister to you. 9 Yet, when I was present with you and I fell into need, I did not become a burden on anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia abundantly supplied my needs. Yes, in every way I kept myself from becoming a burden to you and will continue to do so. 10 As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, I will not stop this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 11 For what reason? Because I do not love you? God knows I do.\n12 But what I am doing I will continue to do, in order to eliminate the pretext of those who are wanting a basis for being found equal to us in the things about which they boast. 13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps disguising himself as an angel of light. 15 It is therefore nothing extraordinary if his ministers also keep disguising themselves as ministers of righteousness. But their end will be according to their works.\n16 I say again: Let no one think I am unreasonable. But even if you do, then accept me as an unreasonable person, so that I too may boast a little. 17 What I now say is, not as following the Lord's example, but as an unreasonable person would, with boastful self-confidence. 18 Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I too will boast. 19 Since you are so \"reasonable,\" you gladly put up with the unreasonable ones. 20 In fact, you put up with whoever enslaves you, whoever devours your possessions, whoever grabs what you have, whoever exalts himself over you, and whoever strikes you in the face.\n21 I say this to our dishonor, since it may seem that we have acted in weakness.\nBut if others act boldly-I am talking unreasonably-I too act boldly. 22 Are they Hebrews? I am one also. Are they Israelites? I am one also. Are they Abraham's offspring? I am also. 23 Are they ministers of Christ? I reply like a madman, I am more outstandingly one: I have done more work, been imprisoned more often, suffered countless beatings, and experienced many near-deaths. 24 Five times I received 40 strokes less one from the Jews, 25 three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck, a night and a day I have spent in the open sea; 26 in journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers, 27 in labor and toil, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst, frequently without food, in cold and lacking clothing.\n28 Besides those things of an external kind, there is what rushes in on me from day to day: the anxiety for all the congregations. 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I am not incensed?\n30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, the One who is to be praised forever, knows I am not lying. 32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes to seize me, 33 but I was lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall, and I escaped his hands.\nChapter 12\n1 I have to boast. It is not beneficial, but I will move on to supernatural visions and revelations of the Lord. 2 I know a man in union with Christ who, 14 years ago-whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know; God knows-was caught away to the third heaven. 3 Yes, I know such a man-whether in the body or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows- 4 who was caught away into paradise and heard words that cannot be spoken and that are not lawful for a man to say. 5 I will boast about such a man, but I will not boast about myself except of my weaknesses. 6 For even if I want to boast, I will not be unreasonable, for I would say the truth. But I refrain from doing so, in order that no one should give me more credit than what he sees in me or hears from me, 7 just because of receiving such extraordinary revelations.\nTo keep me from becoming overly exalted, I was given a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to keep slapping me, so that I might not be overly exalted. 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it would depart from me. 9 But he said to me: \"My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you, for my power is being made perfect in weakness.\" Most gladly, then, I will boast about my weaknesses, in order that the power of the Christ may remain over me like a tent. 10 So I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in times of need, in persecutions and difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful.\n11 I have become unreasonable. You compelled me to, for I ought to have been recommended by you. For I did not prove to be inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing, even if I am nothing. 12 Indeed, the signs of an apostle were produced among you with great endurance, and by signs and wonders and powerful works. 13 For how were you less favored than the rest of the congregations, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Kindly forgive me for this wrong.\n14 Look! This is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not become a burden. For I am seeking, not your possessions, but you; for the children are not expected to save up for their parents, but the parents for their children. 15 For my part, I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for you. If I love you so much more, am I to be loved the less? 16 But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, you say I was \"crafty\" and I caught you \"by trickery.\" 17 I did not take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you, did I? 18 I urged Titus and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you at all, did he? We walked in the same spirit, did we not? In the same footsteps, did we not?\n19 Have you been thinking all along that we have been making our defense to you? It is before God that we are speaking in union with Christ. But, beloved ones, all that we do is to build you up. 20 For I am afraid that somehow when I arrive, I may not find you as I wish and I may not be as you wish, but instead, there may be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, dissension, backbiting, whispering, being puffed up with pride, and disorder. 21 Perhaps when I come again, my God might humiliate me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who previously sinned but have not repented of their uncleanness and sexual immorality and brazen conduct that they have practiced.\nChapter 13\n1 This is the third time I am coming to you. \"On the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter must be established.\" 2 Although I am absent now, it is as if I were present for the second time, and I give my warning in advance to those who sinned previously and to all the rest, that if ever I come again I will not spare them, 3 since you are seeking proof that Christ, who is not weak toward you but strong among you, is really speaking through me. 4 For, indeed, he was executed on the stake because of weakness, but he is alive because of God's power. True, we also are weak with him, but we will live together with him because of God's power toward you.\n5 Keep testing whether you are in the faith; keep proving what you yourselves are. Or do you not recognize that Jesus Christ is in union with you? Unless you are disapproved. 6 I truly hope you will recognize that we are not disapproved.\n7 Now we pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is fine, even if we may appear disapproved. 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth. 9 We certainly rejoice whenever we are weak but you are powerful. And this is what we are praying for, your being readjusted. 10 That is why I write these things while absent, so that when I am present, I may not have to be severe in using the authority that the Lord gave me, to build up and not to tear down.\n11 Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted, to be comforted, to think in agreement, to live peaceably; and the God of love and of peace will be with you. 12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. 13 All the holy ones send you their greetings.\n14 The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the sharing in the holy spirit be with all of you. \n",

    "text": "Colossians\nChapter 1\n1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God's will, and Timothy our brother, 2 to the holy ones and faithful brothers in union with Christ at Colossae:\nMay you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father.\n3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the holy ones 5 because of the hope that is being reserved for you in the heavens. You previously heard about this hope through the message of truth of the good news 6 that has come to you. Just as the good news is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world, so it is also doing among you from the day you heard and accurately knew the undeserved kindness of God in truth. 7 That is what you have learned from our beloved fellow slave Epaphras, who is a faithful minister of the Christ on our behalf. 8 He also made known to us your love in a spiritual way.\n9 That is also why from the day we heard of it, we have never stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension, 10 so as to walk worthily of Jehovah in order to please him fully as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God; 11 and may you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may endure fully with patience and joy, 12 as you thank the Father, who made you qualify to share in the inheritance of the holy ones in the light.\n13 He rescued us from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, 14 by means of whom we have our release by ransom, the forgiveness of our sins. 15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; 16 because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All other things have been created through him and for him. 17 Also, he is before all other things, and by means of him all other things were made to exist, 18 and he is the head of the body, the congregation. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might become the one who is first in all things; 19 because God was pleased to have all fullness to dwell in him, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all other things by making peace through the blood he shed on the torture stake, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.\n21 Indeed, you who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked, 22 he has now reconciled by means of that one's fleshly body through his death, in order to present you holy and unblemished and open to no accusation before him- 23 provided, of course, that you continue in the faith, established on the foundation and steadfast, not being shifted away from the hope of that good news that you heard and that was preached in all creation under heaven. Of this good news I, Paul, became a minister.\n24 I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and I am undergoing the tribulations of the Christ that are yet lacking in my flesh in behalf of his body, which is the congregation. 25 I became a minister of this congregation in accord with the stewardship from God that was given to me in your behalf to preach the word of God fully, 26 the sacred secret that was hidden from the past systems of things and from the past generations. But now it has been revealed to his holy ones, 27 to whom God has been pleased to make known among the nations the glorious riches of this sacred secret, which is Christ in union with you, the hope of his glory. 28 He is the one we are proclaiming, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in union with Christ. 29 To this end I am indeed working hard, exerting myself with his strength that is operating powerfully within me.\nChapter 2\n1 For I want you to realize how great a struggle I am having in your behalf and in behalf of those at Laodicea and in behalf of all those who have not personally seen me. 2 This is so that their hearts may be comforted and that they may be harmoniously joined together in love and may have all the riches that result from the full assurance of their understanding, in order to gain an accurate knowledge of the sacred secret of God, namely, Christ. 3 Carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge. 4 I am saying this so that no one may delude you with persuasive arguments. 5 Though I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.\n6 Therefore, just as you have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord, go on walking in union with him, 7 being rooted and built up in him and being stabilized in the faith, just as you were taught, and overflowing with thanksgiving.\n8 Look out that no one takes you captive by means of the philosophy and empty deception according to human tradition, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ; 9 because it is in him that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells bodily. 10 So you have acquired a fullness by means of him, the one who is the head of all government and authority. 11 By your relationship with him, you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands by stripping off the fleshly body, by the circumcision that belongs to the Christ. 12 For you were buried with him in his baptism, and by your relationship with him you were also raised up together through your faith in the powerful work of God, who raised him up from the dead.\n13 Furthermore, though you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh, God made you alive together with him. He kindly forgave us all our trespasses 14 and erased the handwritten document that consisted of decrees and was in opposition to us. He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake. 15 He has stripped the governments and the authorities bare and has publicly exhibited them as conquered, leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it.\n16 Therefore, do not let anyone judge you about what you eat and drink or about the observance of a festival or of the new moon or of a sabbath. 17 Those things are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to the Christ. 18 Let no man deprive you of the prize who takes delight in a false humility and a form of worship of the angels, \"taking his stand on\" the things he has seen. He is actually puffed up without proper cause by his fleshly frame of mind, 19 and he is not holding fast to the head, to the one through whom the whole body is supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments and made to grow with the growth that is from God.\n20 If you died together with Christ with respect to the elementary things of the world, why do you live as if still part of the world by further subjecting yourselves to the decrees: 21 \"Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,\" 22 referring to things that all perish with their use, according to the commands and teachings of men? 23 Although those things have an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship and a false humility, a harsh treatment of the body, they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh.\nChapter 3\n1 If, however, you were raised up with the Christ, go on seeking the things above, where the Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 2 Keep your minds fixed on the things above, not on the things on the earth. 3 For you died, and your life has been hidden with the Christ in union with God. 4 When the Christ, our life, is made manifest, then you also will be made manifest with him in glory.\n5 Deaden, therefore, your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness, which is idolatry. 6 On account of those things the wrath of God is coming. 7 That is how you too used to conduct yourselves in your former way of life. 8 But now you must put them all away from you: wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth. 9 Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices, 10 and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it, 11 where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, or freeman; but Christ is all things and in all.\n12 Accordingly, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience. 13 Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same. 14 But besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.\n15 Also, let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts, for you were called to that peace in one body. And show yourselves thankful. 16 Let the word of the Christ reside in you richly in all wisdom. Keep on teaching and encouraging one another with psalms, praises to God, spiritual songs sung with gratitude, singing in your hearts to Jehovah. 17 Whatever it is that you do in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.\n18 You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord. 19 You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them. 20 You children, be obedient to your parents in everything, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. 21 You fathers, do not be exasperating your children, so that they do not become downhearted. 22 You slaves, be obedient in everything to those who are your human masters, not only when they are watching, just to please men, but with sincerity of heart, with fear of Jehovah. 23 Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah, and not for men, 24 for you know that it is from Jehovah you will receive the inheritance as a reward. Slave for the Master, Christ. 25 Certainly the one who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.\nChapter 4\n1 You masters, treat your slaves in a righteous and fair way, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.\n2 Persevere in prayer, remaining awake in it with thanksgiving. 3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open a door for the word so that we can declare the sacred secret about the Christ, for which I am in prison bonds, 4 and that I may proclaim it as clearly as I ought to.\n5 Go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside, making the best use of your time. 6 Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should answer each person.\n7 Tychicus, my beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me. 8 I am sending him to you so that you will know how we are and that he may comfort your hearts. 9 He is coming along with Onesimus, my faithful and beloved brother, who is from among you; they will tell you all the things happening here.\n10 Aristarchus, my fellow captive, sends you his greetings, and so does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions to welcome him if he comes to you), 11 and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of those circumcised. Only these are my fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, and they have become a source of great comfort to me. 12 Epaphras, a slave of Christ Jesus who is from among you, sends you his greetings. He is always exerting himself in your behalf in his prayers, so that you may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God. 13 For I bear him witness that he makes great efforts in your behalf and in behalf of those in Laodicea and Hierapolis.\n14 Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and so does Demas. 15 Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea and to Nympha and to the congregation at her house. 16 And when this letter has been read among you, arrange for it also to be read in the congregation of the Laodiceans and for you also to read the one from Laodicea. 17 Also, tell Archippus: \"Pay attention to the ministry that you accepted in the Lord, in order to fulfill it.\"\n18 Here is my greeting, Paul's, in my own hand. Keep my prison bonds in mind. The undeserved kindness be with you. \n",

    "text": "Hebrews\nChapter 1\n1 Long ago God spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many occasions and in many ways. 2 Now at the end of these days he has spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things. 3 He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. And after he had made a purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 4 So he has become better than the angels to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs.\n5 For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: \"You are my son; today I have become your father\"? And again: \"I will become his father, and he will become my son\"? 6 But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: \"And let all of God's angels do obeisance to him.\"\n7 Also, he says about the angels: \"He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.\" 8 But about the Son, he says: \"God is your throne forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness. 9 You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.\" 10 And: \"At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands. 11 They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out, 12 and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.\"\n13 But about which of the angels has he ever said: \"Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet\"? 14 Are they not all spirits for holy service, sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?\nChapter 2\n1 That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard, so that we never drift away. 2 For if the word spoken through angels proved to be sure, and every transgression and disobedient act received a punishment in harmony with justice, 3 how will we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation? For it began to be spoken through our Lord and was verified for us by those who heard him, 4 while God joined in bearing witness with signs and wonders and various powerful works and with the holy spirit distributed according to his will.\n5 For it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come, about which we are speaking. 6 But in one place a certain witness said: \"What is man that you keep him in mind, or a son of man that you take care of him? 7 You made him a little lower than angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and appointed him over the works of your hands. 8 All things you subjected under his feet.\" By subjecting all things to him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him. 9 But we do see Jesus, who was made a little lower than angels, now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, so that by God's undeserved kindness he might taste death for everyone.\n10 For it was fitting that the one for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 11 For both the one who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified all stem from one, and for this reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers, 12 as he says: \"I will declare your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you with song.\" 13 And again: \"I will put my trust in him.\" And again: \"Look! I and the young children, whom Jehovah gave me.\"\n14 Therefore, since the \"young children\" are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly shared in the same things, so that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil, 15 and that he might set free all those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. 16 For it is not really angels he is assisting, but he is assisting Abraham's offspring. 17 Consequently, he had to become like his \"brothers\" in all respects, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the people. 18 Since he himself has suffered when being put to the test, he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test.\nChapter 3\n1 Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest whom we acknowledge-Jesus. 2 He was faithful to the One who appointed him, just as Moses also was in all the house of that One. 3 For he is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, since the one who constructs a house has more honor than the house itself. 4 Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God. 5 Now Moses was faithful as an attendant in all the house of that One as a testimony of the things that were to be spoken afterward, 6 but Christ was faithful as a son over God's house. We are His house if, indeed, we hold on firmly to our freeness of speech and the hope of which we boast down to the end.\n7 Therefore, just as the holy spirit says, \"Today if you listen to his voice, 8 do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger, as in the day of testing in the wilderness, 9 where your forefathers put me to the test and tried me, despite seeing my works for 40 years. 10 This is why I became disgusted with this generation and said: 'They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not come to know my ways.' 11 So I swore in my anger: 'They will not enter into my rest.'\"\n12 Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of you a wicked heart lacking faith by drawing away from the living God; 13 but keep on encouraging one another each day, as long as it is called \"Today,\" so that none of you should become hardened by the deceptive power of sin. 14 For we actually become partakers of the Christ only if we hold firmly down to the end the confidence we had at the beginning. 15 As it is said, \"Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts as on the occasion of provoking to bitter anger.\"\n16 For who heard and yet provoked him to bitter anger? Was it not, in fact, all those who went out of Egypt under Moses? 17 Moreover, with whom did God become disgusted for 40 years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 18 And to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? Was it not to those who acted disobediently? 19 So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith.\nChapter 4\n1 Therefore, since a promise of entering into his rest remains, let us be on guard for fear someone among you seems to fall short of it. 2 For we have also had the good news declared to us, just as they had; but the word that they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. 3 For we who have exercised faith do enter into the rest, just as he has said: \"So I swore in my anger, 'They will not enter into my rest,'\" although his works were finished from the founding of the world. 4 For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: \"And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,\" 5 and here again he says: \"They will not enter into my rest.\"\n6 Therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience, 7 he again marks off a certain day by saying long afterward in David's psalm, \"Today\"; just as it has been said above, \"Today if you listen to his voice, do not harden your hearts.\" 8 For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, God would not afterward have spoken of another day. 9 So there remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God. 10 For the man who has entered into God's rest has also rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.\n11 Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same pattern of disobedience. 12 For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13 And there is not a creation that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.\n14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold on to our public declaration of him. 15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have, but without sin. 16 Let us, then, approach the throne of undeserved kindness with freeness of speech, so that we may receive mercy and find undeserved kindness to help us at the right time.\nChapter 5\n1 For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in their behalf over the things relating to God, so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 2 He is able to deal compassionately with the ignorant and erring ones, since he too is confronted with his own weakness, 3 and because of that he must make offerings for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.\n4 A man does not take this honor of his own accord, but he receives it only when he is called by God, just as Aaron was. 5 So, too, the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by the One who said to him: \"You are my son; today I have become your father.\" 6 As he also says in another place, \"You are a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.\"\n7 During his life on earth, Christ offered up supplications and also petitions, with strong outcries and tears, to the One who was able to save him out of death, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear. 8 Although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered. 9 And after he had been made perfect, he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him, 10 because he has been designated by God a high priest in the manner of Melchizedek.\n11 We have much to say about him, and it is difficult to explain, because you have become dull in your hearing. 12 For although by now you should be teachers, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God, and you have gone back to needing milk, not solid food. 13 For everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a young child. 14 But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.\nChapter 6\n1 Therefore, now that we have moved beyond the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works and faith in God, 2 the teaching on baptisms and the laying on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead and everlasting judgment. 3 And this we will do, if God indeed permits.\n4 For as regards those who were once enlightened and who have tasted the heavenly free gift and who have become partakers of holy spirit 5 and who have tasted the fine word of God and powers of the coming system of things, 6 but have fallen away, it is impossible to revive them again to repentance, because they nail the Son of God to the stake again for themselves and expose him to public shame. 7 For the ground receives a blessing from God when it drinks in the rain that frequently falls on it and then produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated. 8 But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is rejected and is near to being cursed, and in the end it will be burned.\n9 But in your case, beloved ones, we are convinced of better things, things related to salvation, even though we are speaking in this way. 10 For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones. 11 But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end, 12 so that you may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.\n13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself, 14 saying: \"I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you.\" 15 So after Abraham had shown patience, he obtained this promise. 16 For men swear by someone greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, since it is a legal guarantee to them. 17 In this same way, when God decided to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, 18 in order that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to take firm hold of the hope set before us. 19 We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain, 20 where a forerunner has entered in our behalf, Jesus, who has become a high priest in the manner of Melchizedek forever.\nChapter 7\n1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2 and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name is translated \"King of Righteousness,\" and then also king of Salem, that is, \"King of Peace.\" 3 In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but being made like the Son of God, he remains a priest for all time.\n4 See how great this man was to whom Abraham, the family head, gave a tenth out of the best spoils. 5 True, according to the Law, those of the sons of Levi who receive their priestly office have a commandment to collect tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, even though these are descendants of Abraham. 6 But this man who did not trace his genealogy from them took tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7 Now it is undeniable that the lesser one is blessed by the greater. 8 And in the one case, it is men who are dying who receive tithes, but in the other case, it is someone of whom witness is given that he lives. 9 And it could be said that even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham, 10 for he was still a future descendant of his forefather when Melchizedek met him.\n11 If, then, perfection was attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for it was a feature of the Law that was given to the people), what further need would there be for another priest to arise who is said to be in the manner of Melchizedek and not in the manner of Aaron? 12 For since the priesthood is being changed, it becomes necessary to change the Law as well. 13 For the man about whom these things are said came from another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14 For it is clear that our Lord has descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.\n15 And this becomes even clearer when another priest arises who is like Melchizedek, 16 who has become such, not by the legal requirement that depends on fleshly descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. 17 For it is said in witness of him: \"You are a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.\"\n18 So, then, the former commandment is set aside because it is weak and ineffective. 19 For the Law made nothing perfect, but the introduction of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God. 20 Also, inasmuch as this was not done without an oath being sworn 21 (for, indeed, there are men who have become priests without a sworn oath, but this one has become so through an oath sworn respecting him by the One who said: \"Jehovah has sworn, and he will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever'\"), 22 Jesus has accordingly become the guarantee of a better covenant. 23 Furthermore, many had to become priests in succession because death prevented them from continuing as such, 24 but because he continues alive forever, his priesthood has no successors. 25 So he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.\n26 For it is fitting for us to have such a high priest who is loyal, innocent, undefiled, separated from the sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 27 Unlike those high priests, he does not need to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, because he did this once for all time when he offered himself up. 28 For the Law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses, but the word of the oath sworn after the Law appoints a Son, who has been made perfect forever.\nChapter 8\n1 Now this is the main point of what we are saying: We have such a high priest as this, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 2 a minister of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah set up, and not man. 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. 4 If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the Law. 5 These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to construct the tent, was given the divine command: For He says: \"See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.\" 6 But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry because he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established on better promises.\n7 If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second. 8 For he does find fault with the people when he says: \"'Look! The days are coming,' says Jehovah, 'when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant. 9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not remain in my covenant, so I stopped caring for them,' says Jehovah.\n10 \"'For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,' says Jehovah. 'I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I will write them. And I will become their God, and they will become my people.\n11 \"'And they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: \"Know Jehovah!\" For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them. 12 For I will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and I will no longer call their sins to mind.'\"\n13 In his saying \"a new covenant,\" he has made the former one obsolete. Now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.\nChapter 9\n1 For its part, the former covenant used to have legal requirements for sacred service and its holy place on earth. 2 For a first tent compartment was constructed, in which were the lampstand and the table and the display of the loaves of presentation; and it is called the Holy Place. 3 But behind the second curtain was the tent compartment called the Most Holy. 4 This had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant completely overlaid with gold, in which were the golden jar containing the manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant; 5 and above it were the glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory cover. But now is not the time to speak of these things in detail.\n6 After these things were constructed this way, the priests enter the first tent compartment regularly to perform the sacred services; 7 but the high priest enters alone into the second compartment once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins that the people committed in ignorance. 8 Thus the holy spirit makes it clear that the way into the holy place had not yet been revealed while the first tent was standing. 9 This tent is an illustration for the present time, and according to this arrangement, both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the conscience of the man doing sacred service perfect. 10 They have to do only with foods and drinks and various ceremonial washings. They were legal requirements concerning the body and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight.\n11 However, when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have already taken place, he passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. 12 He entered into the holy place, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time, and obtained an everlasting deliverance for us. 13 For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies for the cleansing of the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may render sacred service to the living God?\n15 That is why he is a mediator of a new covenant, in order that because a death has occurred for their release by ransom from the transgressions under the former covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance. 16 For where there is a covenant, the death of the human covenanter needs to be established, 17 because a covenant is valid at death, since it is not in force as long as the human covenanter is living. 18 Consequently, neither was the former covenant put into effect without blood. 19 For when Moses had spoken every commandment of the Law to all the people, he took the blood of the young bulls and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book and all the people, 20 saying: \"This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded you to keep.\" 21 He likewise sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the holy service with the blood. 22 Yes, according to the Law nearly all things are cleansed with blood, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.\n23 Therefore, it was necessary for the typical representations of the things in the heavens to be cleansed by these means, but the heavenly things require far better sacrifices. 24 For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, so that he now appears before God on our behalf. 25 This was not done to offer himself often, as when the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year with blood that is not his own. 26 Otherwise, he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself. 27 And just as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this to receive a judgment, 28 so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many; and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin, and he will be seen by those earnestly looking for him for their salvation.\nChapter 10\n1 For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year, make those who approach perfect. 2 Otherwise, would not the sacrifices have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service once cleansed would have no consciousness of sins anymore? 3 On the contrary, these sacrifices are a reminder of sins year after year, 4 for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away.\n5 So when he comes into the world, he says: \"'Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. 6 You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offerings.' 7 Then I said: 'Look! I have come (in the scroll it is written about me) to do your will, O God.'\" 8 After first saying: \"You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings\"-sacrifices that are offered according to the Law- 9 then he says: \"Look! I have come to do your will.\" He does away with what is first in order to establish what is second. 10 By this \"will\" we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.\n11 Also, every priest takes his station day after day to offer holy service and to make the same sacrifices often, which can never take sins away completely. 12 But this man offered one sacrifice for sins for all time and sat down at the right hand of God, 13 from then on waiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet. 14 For it is by one sacrificial offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect for all time. 15 Moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said: 16 \"'This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,' says Jehovah. 'I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I will write them.'\" 17 Then it says: \"And I will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind.\" 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.\n19 Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place by the blood of Jesus, 20 which he opened up for us as a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh, 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us approach with sincere hearts and complete faith, having had our hearts sprinkled clean from a wicked conscience and our bodies bathed with clean water. 23 Let us hold firmly the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for the one who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works, 25 not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.\n26 For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, 27 but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a burning indignation that is going to consume those in opposition. 28 Anyone who has disregarded the Law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three. 29 How much greater punishment do you think a person will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God and who has regarded as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt? 30 For we know the One who said: \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay.\" And again: \"Jehovah will judge his people.\" 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\n32 However, keep remembering the former days in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle along with sufferings. 33 At times you were publicly exposed both to reproaches and to tribulations, and at times you shared with those who were having such an experience. 34 For you expressed sympathy for those in prison and you accepted joyfully the plundering of your belongings, knowing that you yourselves have a better and an enduring possession.\n35 Therefore, do not throw away your boldness, which will be richly rewarded. 36 For you need endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise. 37 For yet \"a very little while,\" and \"the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.\" 38 \"But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,\" and \"if he shrinks back, I have no pleasure in him.\" 39 Now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction, but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.\nChapter 11\n1 Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen. 2 For by means of it, the men of ancient times had witness borne to them.\n3 By faith we perceive that the systems of things were put in order by God's word, so that what is seen has come into existence from things that are not visible.\n4 By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain, and through that faith he received the witness that he was righteous, for God approved his gifts, and although he died, he still speaks through his faith.\n5 By faith Enoch was transferred so as not to see death, and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him; for before he was transferred he received the witness that he had pleased God well. 6 Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.\n7 By faith Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; and through this faith he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.\n8 By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an inheritance; he went out, although not knowing where he was going. 9 By faith he lived as a foreigner in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the very same promise. 10 For he was awaiting the city having real foundations, whose designer and builder is God.\n11 By faith also Sarah received power to conceive offspring, even when she was past the age, since she considered Him faithful who made the promise. 12 For this reason, from one man who was as good as dead, there were born children, as many as the stars of heaven in number and as innumerable as the sands by the seaside.\n13 In faith all of these died, although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises; but they saw them from a distance and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. 14 For those who speak in such a way make it evident that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own. 15 And yet, if they had kept remembering the place from which they had departed, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 But now they are reaching out for a better place, that is, one belonging to heaven. Therefore, God is not ashamed of them, to be called on as their God, for he has prepared a city for them.\n17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac-the man who had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son- 18 although it had been said to him: \"What will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.\" 19 But he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead, and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.\n20 By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.\n21 By faith Jacob, when about to die, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped while leaning on the top of his staff.\n22 By faith Joseph, nearing his end, spoke of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and he gave instructions concerning his bones.\n23 By faith Moses was hid by his parents for three months after his birth, because they saw that the young child was beautiful and they did not fear the order of the king. 24 By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, 25 choosing to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, 26 because he considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward. 27 By faith he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king, for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible. 28 By faith he observed the Passover and the splashing of the blood, so that the destroyer might not harm their firstborn.\n29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, but when the Egyptians attempted it, they were swallowed up.\n30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after the people had marched around them for seven days. 31 By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who acted disobediently, because she received the spies in a peaceable way.\n32 And what more will I say? For time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, as well as Samuel and the other prophets. 33 Through faith they defeated kingdoms, brought about righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 34 quenched the force of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from a weak state were made powerful, became mighty in war, routed invading armies. 35 Women received their dead by resurrection, but other men were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection. 36 Yes, others received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by chains and prisons. 37 They were stoned, they were tried, they were sawn in two, they were slaughtered by the sword, they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, while they were in need, in tribulation, mistreated; 38 and the world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves and dens of the earth.\n39 And yet all of these, although they received a favorable witness because of their faith, did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise, 40 because God had foreseen something better for us, so that they might not be made perfect apart from us.\nChapter 12\n1 So, then, because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also throw off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 as we look intently at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus. For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such hostile speech from sinners against their own interests, so that you may not get tired and give up.\n4 In your struggle against that sin, you have never yet resisted to the point of having your blood shed. 5 And you have entirely forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: \"My son, do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah, nor give up when you are corrected by him; 6 for those whom Jehovah loves he disciplines, in fact, he scourges everyone whom he receives as a son.\"\n7 You need to endure as part of your discipline. God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8 But if you have not all shared in receiving this discipline, you are really illegitimate children, and not sons. 9 Furthermore, our human fathers used to discipline us, and we gave them respect. Should we not more readily submit ourselves to the Father of our spiritual life and live? 10 For they disciplined us for a short time according to what seemed good to them, but he does so for our benefit so that we may partake of his holiness. 11 True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but it is painful; yet afterward, it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.\n12 Therefore, strengthen the hands that hang down and the feeble knees, 13 and keep making straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but, rather, may be healed. 14 Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord. 15 Carefully watch that no one fails to obtain the undeserved kindness of God, so that no poisonous root springs up to cause trouble and many are defiled by it; 16 and watch that among you there is no one who is sexually immoral nor anyone who does not appreciate sacred things, like Esau, who gave up his rights as firstborn in exchange for one meal. 17 For you know that afterward when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for although he earnestly tried to bring about a change of mind with tears, it was to no avail.\n18 For you have not approached something that can be felt and that has been set aflame with fire, and a dark cloud and thick darkness and a storm, 19 and the blast of a trumpet and the voice speaking words, which on hearing, the people begged that nothing further should be spoken to them. 20 For they could not bear the command: \"If even a beast touches the mountain, it must be stoned.\" 21 Also, the display was so terrifying that Moses said: \"I am afraid and trembling.\" 22 But you have approached a Mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels 23 in general assembly, and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and God the Judge of all, and the spiritual lives of righteous ones who have been made perfect, 24 and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and the sprinkled blood, which speaks in a better way than Abel's blood.\n25 See that you do not refuse to listen to the one who is speaking. For if those who refused to listen to the one giving divine warning on earth did not escape, how much more will we not escape if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens! 26 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised: \"Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.\" 27 Now the expression \"yet once more\" indicates the removal of the things that are shaken, things that have been made, in order that the things not shaken may remain. 28 Therefore, seeing that we are to receive a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to receive undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe. 29 For our God is a consuming fire.\nChapter 13\n1 Let your brotherly love continue. 2 Do not forget hospitality, for through it some unknowingly entertained angels. 3 Keep in mind those in prison, as though you were imprisoned with them, and those being mistreated, since you yourselves also are in the body. 4 Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers. 5 Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things. For he has said: \"I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.\" 6 So that we may be of good courage and say: \"Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?\"\n7 Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith.\n8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.\n9 Do not be led astray by various and strange teachings, for it is better for the heart to be strengthened by undeserved kindness than by foods, which do not benefit those occupied with them.\n10 We have an altar from which those who offer sacred service at the tent have no authority to eat. 11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is taken into the holy place as a sin offering by the high priest are burned up outside the camp. 12 Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people with his own blood. 13 Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach he bore, 14 for we do not have here a city that remains, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come. 15 Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of our lips that make public declaration to his name. 16 Moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.\n17 Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over you as those who will render an account, so that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you.\n18 Keep praying for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things. 19 But I especially urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you the sooner.\n20 Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, with the blood of an everlasting covenant, 21 equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us through Jesus Christ what is well-pleasing in his sight, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\n22 Now I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to this word of encouragement, for I have written you a short letter. 23 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon, I will be with him when I see you.\n24 Give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead among you and to all the holy ones. Those in Italy send you their greetings.\n25 The undeserved kindness be with all of you. \n",

    "text": "Revelation \nChapter 1\n1 A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him, to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. And he sent his angel and presented it in signs through him to his slave John, 2 who bore witness to the word God gave and to the witness Jesus Christ gave, yes, to all the things he saw. 3 Happy is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and who observe the things written in it, for the appointed time is near.\n4 John to the seven congregations that are in the province of Asia:\nMay you have undeserved kindness and peace from \"the One who is and who was and who is coming,\" and from the seven spirits that are before his throne, 5 and from Jesus Christ, \"the Faithful Witness,\" \"the firstborn from the dead,\" and \"the Ruler of the kings of the earth.\"\nTo him who loves us and who set us free from our sins by means of his own blood- 6 and he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his God and Father-yes, to him be the glory and the might forever. Amen.\n7 Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him. Yes, Amen.\n8 \"I am the Alpha and the Omega,\" says Jehovah God, \"the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.\"\n9 I John, your brother and a sharer with you in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in association with Jesus, was on the island called Patmos for speaking about God and bearing witness concerning Jesus. 10 By inspiration I came to be in the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a strong voice like that of a trumpet, 11 saying: \"What you see, write in a scroll and send it to the seven congregations: in Ephesus, in Smyrna, in Pergamum, in Thyatira, in Sardis, in Philadelphia, and in Laodicea.\"\n12 I turned to see who was speaking with me, and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, 13 and in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man, clothed in a garment that reached down to the feet and wearing a golden sash around his chest. 14 Moreover, his head and his hair were white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame, 15 and his feet were like fine copper when glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth a sharp, long, two-edged sword was protruding, and his countenance was like the sun when it shines at its brightest. 17 When I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet.\nAnd he laid his right hand on me and said: \"Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, 18 and the living one, and I became dead, but look! I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of the Grave. 19 So write down the things you saw, and the things that are, and the things that will take place after these. 20 As for the sacred secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars mean the angels of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands mean the seven congregations.\nChapter 2\n1 \"To the angel of the congregation in Ephesus write: These are the things that he says who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands: 2 'I know your deeds, and your labor and endurance, and that you cannot tolerate bad men, and that you put to the test those who say they are apostles, but they are not, and you found them to be liars. 3 You are also showing endurance, and you have persevered for the sake of my name and have not grown weary. 4 Nevertheless, I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.\n5 \"'Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and repent and do the deeds you did at first. If you do not, I will come to you, and I will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. 6 Still, you do have this in your favor: that you hate the deeds of the sect of Nicolaus, which I also hate. 7 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations: To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.'\n8 \"And to the angel of the congregation in Smyrna write: These are the things that he says, 'the First and the Last,' who became dead and came to life again: 9 'I know your tribulation and poverty-but you are rich-and the blasphemy by those who call themselves Jews and really are not, but they are a synagogue of Satan. 10 Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison so that you may be fully put to the test, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life. 11 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations: The one who conquers will by no means be harmed by the second death.'\n12 \"To the angel of the congregation in Pergamum write: These are the things that he says who has the sharp, long, two-edged sword: 13 'I know where you are dwelling, that is, where the throne of Satan is; and yet you keep holding fast to my name, and you did not deny your faith in me even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed by your side, where Satan is dwelling.\n14 \"'Nevertheless, I have a few things against you, that you have there those adhering to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality. 15 In the same way, you also have those adhering to the teaching of the sect of Nicolaus. 16 So repent. If you do not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will war against them with the long sword of my mouth.\n17 \"'Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations: To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white pebble, and written on the pebble is a new name that no one knows except the one receiving it.'\n18 \"To the angel of the congregation in Thyatira write: These are the things that the Son of God says, the one who has eyes like a fiery flame and whose feet are like fine copper: 19 'I know your deeds, and your love and faith and ministry and endurance, and that your deeds of late are more than those you did at first.\n20 \"'Nevertheless, I do hold this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and misleads my slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat things sacrificed to idols. 21 And I gave her time to repent, but she is not willing to repent of her sexual immorality. 22 Look! I am about to throw her into a sickbed, and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her deeds. 23 And I will kill her children with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that I am the one who searches the innermost thoughts and hearts, and I will give to you individually according to your deeds.\n24 \"'However, I say to the rest of you who are in Thyatira, all those who do not follow this teaching, those who did not get to know the so-called \"deep things of Satan\": I am not putting on you any other burden. 25 Just the same, hold fast to what you have until I come. 26 And to the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end, I will give authority over the nations, 27 and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, just as I have received from my Father. 28 And I will give him the morning star. 29 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.'\nChapter 3\n1 \"To the angel of the congregation in Sardis write: These are the things that he says who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: 'I know your deeds, that you have the name that you are alive, but you are dead. 2 Become watchful, and strengthen the things remaining that were ready to die, for I have not found your works fully performed before my God. 3 Therefore, continue mindful of how you have received and how you heard, and go on keeping it, and repent. Certainly unless you wake up, I will come as a thief, and you will not know at all at what hour I will come upon you.\n4 \"'Nevertheless, you do have a few individuals in Sardis who did not defile their garments, and they will walk with me in white ones, because they are worthy. 5 The one who conquers will thus be dressed in white garments, and I will by no means blot out his name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge his name before my Father and before his angels. 6 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.'\n7 \"To the angel of the congregation in Philadelphia write: These are the things he says who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens so that no one will shut and shuts so that no one opens: 8 'I know your deeds-look! I have set before you an opened door, which no one can shut. And I know that you have a little power, and you kept my word and did not prove false to my name. 9 Look! I will make those from the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews yet are not, but are lying-look! I will make them come and bow before your feet and make them know that I have loved you. 10 Because you kept the word about my endurance, I will also keep you from the hour of test, which is to come upon the entire inhabited earth, to put to the test those dwelling on the earth. 11 I am coming quickly. Keep holding fast to what you have, so that no one may take your crown.\n12 \"'The one who conquers-I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will by no means go out from it anymore, and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem that descends out of heaven from my God, and my own new name. 13 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.'\n14 \"To the angel of the congregation in Laodicea write: These are the things that the Amen says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God: 15 'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or else hot. 16 So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth. 17 Because you say, \"I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,\" but you do not know that you are miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked, 18 I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may become dressed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be exposed, and eyesalve to rub in your eyes so that you may see.\n19 \"'All those for whom I have affection, I reprove and discipline. So be zealous and repent. 20 Look! I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into his house and take the evening meal with him and he with me. 21 To the one who conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, just as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. 22 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit says to the congregations.'\"\nChapter 4\n1 After this I saw, and look! an opened door in heaven, and the first voice that I heard speaking with me was like a trumpet, saying: \"Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place.\" 2 After this I immediately came to be in the power of the spirit, and look! a throne was in its position in heaven, and someone was seated on the throne. 3 And the One seated had the appearance of a jasper stone and a sardius stone, and all around the throne was a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.\n4 All around the throne were 24 thrones, and on these thrones I saw seated 24 elders dressed in white garments, and on their heads golden crowns. 5 From the throne were coming lightning and voices and thunders; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and these mean the seven spirits of God. 6 Before the throne was something resembling a glassy sea, like crystal.\nIn the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures that were full of eyes in front and behind. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature was like a young bull, and the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 8 As for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath. And continuously, day and night, they say: \"Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.\"\n9 Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the One seated on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever, 10 the 24 elders fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship the One who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11 \"You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.\"\nChapter 5\n1 And I saw in the right hand of the One seated on the throne a scroll written on both sides, sealed tight with seven seals. 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice: \"Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?\" 3 But no one in heaven or on earth or underneath the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it. 4 I gave way to a great deal of weeping because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. 5 But one of the elders said to me: \"Stop weeping. Look! The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.\"\n6 And I saw standing in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a lamb that seemed to have been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, and the eyes mean the seven spirits of God that have been sent out into the whole earth. 7 At once he came forward and took it out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne. 8 When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb, and each one had a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense. (The incense means the prayers of the holy ones.) 9 And they sing a new song, saying: \"You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, for you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought people for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 10 and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth.\"\n11 And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, 12 and they were saying with a loud voice: \"The Lamb who was slaughtered is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.\"\n13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth and on the sea, and all the things in them, saying: \"To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.\" 14 The four living creatures were saying: \"Amen!\" and the elders fell down and worshipped.\nChapter 6\n1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder: \"Come!\" 2 And I saw, and look! a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went out conquering and to complete his conquest.\n3 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: \"Come!\" 4 Another came out, a fiery-colored horse, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another, and he was given a great sword.\n5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: \"Come!\" And I saw, and look! a black horse, and the one seated on it had a pair of scales in his hand. 6 I heard what sounded like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: \"A quart of wheat for a denarius and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.\"\n7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: \"Come!\" 8 And I saw, and look! a pale horse, and the one seated on it had the name Death. And the Grave was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.\n9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the witness they had given. 10 They shouted with a loud voice, saying: \"Until when, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, are you refraining from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?\" 11 And a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number was filled of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they had been.\n12 And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the entire moon became as blood, 13 and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as when a fig tree shaken by a high wind drops its unripe figs. 14 And the heaven departed as a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and every island was removed from its place. 15 Then the kings of the earth, the high officials, the military commanders, the rich, the strong, every slave, and every free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 16 And they keep saying to the mountains and to the rocks: \"Fall over us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, 17 because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?\"\nChapter 7\n1 After this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding tight the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree. 2 And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrise, having a seal of the living God; and he called with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, 3 saying: \"Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until after we have sealed the slaves of our God in their foreheads.\"\n4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:\n5 Out of the tribe of Judah 12,000 sealed;\nout of the tribe of Reuben 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Gad 12,000;\n6 out of the tribe of Asher 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Naphtali 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Manasseh 12,000;\n7 out of the tribe of Simeon 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Levi 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Issachar 12,000;\n8 out of the tribe of Zebulun 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Joseph 12,000;\nout of the tribe of Benjamin 12,000 sealed.\n9 After this I saw, and look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands. 10 And they keep shouting with a loud voice, saying: \"Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.\"\n11 All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell facedown before the throne and worshipped God, 12 saying: \"Amen! Let the praise and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.\"\n13 In response one of the elders said to me: \"These who are dressed in the white robes, who are they and where did they come from?\" 14 So right away I said to him: \"My lord, you are the one who knows.\" And he said to me: \"These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 That is why they are before the throne of God, and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them. 16 They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down on them nor any scorching heat, 17 because the Lamb, who is in the midst of the throne, will shepherd them and will guide them to springs of waters of life. And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.\"\nChapter 8\n1 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.\n3 Another angel, holding a golden incense vessel, arrived and stood at the altar, and a large quantity of incense was given him to offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that was before the throne. 4 The smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel ascended with the prayers of the holy ones before God. 5 But right away the angel took the incense vessel, and he filled it with some of the fire of the altar and hurled it to the earth. And there were thunders and voices and flashes of lightning and an earthquake. 6 And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.\n7 The first one blew his trumpet. And there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green vegetation was burned up.\n8 The second angel blew his trumpet. And something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. And a third of the sea became blood; 9 and a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were wrecked.\n10 The third angel blew his trumpet. And a great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters. 11 The name of the star is Wormwood. And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many of the people died from the waters, because these had been made bitter.\n12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet. And a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, in order that a third of them might be darkened and the day might not have light for a third of it, and the night likewise.\n13 And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: \"Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!\"\nChapter 9\n1 The fifth angel blew his trumpet. And I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and the key to the shaft of the abyss was given to him. 2 He opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened, also the air, by the smoke of the shaft. 3 And locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and authority was given to them, the same authority that the scorpions of the earth have. 4 They were told not to harm the vegetation of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.\n5 And it was granted the locusts, not to kill them, but to torment them five months, and their torment was like torment by a scorpion when it strikes a person. 6 In those days people will seek death but will by no means find it, and they will long to die, but death will flee from them.\n7 And in appearance the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; on their heads were what seemed to be crowns of gold, and their faces were like human faces, 8 but they had hair like women's hair. And their teeth were like those of lions, 9 and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was like the sound of horse-drawn chariots rushing into battle. 10 Also, they have tails with stingers like scorpions, and in their tails is their authority to hurt the people for five months. 11 They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.\n12 The one woe is past. Look! Two more woes are coming after these things.\n13 The sixth angel blew his trumpet. And I heard one voice from the horns of the golden altar that is before God 14 say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet: \"Untie the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.\" 15 And the four angels who have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were untied to kill a third of the people.\n16 The number of the armies of cavalry was two myriads of myriads; I heard the number of them. 17 And this is how I saw the horses in the vision and those seated on them: They had fire-red and hyacinth-blue and sulfur-yellow breastplates, and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths. 18 A third of the people were killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the sulfur that came out of their mouths. 19 For the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with these they inflict harm.\n20 But the rest of the people who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands; they did not stop worshipping the demons and the idols of gold and silver and copper and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk. 21 And they did not repent of their murders nor of their spiritistic practices nor of their sexual immorality nor of their thefts.\nChapter 10\n1 And I saw another strong angel descending from heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire, 2 and he had in his hand a little scroll that had been unrolled. And he set his right foot on the sea, but his left one on the earth, 3 and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion roars. And when he cried out, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.\n4 Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice out of heaven say: \"Seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.\" 5 The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven, 6 and he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it: \"There will be no delay any longer. 7 But in the days when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet, the sacred secret that God declared as good news to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.\"\n8 And I heard the voice out of heaven speaking again with me and saying: \"Go, take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth.\" 9 I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. He said to me: \"Take it and eat it up, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey.\" 10 I took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. 11 And they said to me: \"You must prophesy again about peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.\"\nChapter 11\n1 And a reed like a rod was given to me as he said: \"Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshipping in it. 2 But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, leave it out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for 42 months. 3 I will cause my two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days dressed in sackcloth.\" 4 These are symbolized by the two olive trees and the two lampstands and are standing before the Lord of the earth.\n5 If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and consumes their enemies. If anyone should want to harm them, this is how he must be killed. 6 These have the authority to shut up the sky so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every sort of plague as often as they wish.\n7 When they have finished their witnessing, the wild beast that ascends out of the abyss will wage war with them and conquer them and kill them. 8 And their corpses will be on the main street of the great city that is in a spiritual sense called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also executed on the stake. 9 And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb. 10 And those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those dwelling on the earth.\n11 After the three and a half days, spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them. 12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them: \"Come up here.\" And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them. 13 In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; and 7,000 persons were killed by the earthquake, and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.\n14 The second woe is past. Look! The third woe is coming quickly.\n15 The seventh angel blew his trumpet. And there were loud voices in heaven, saying: \"The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.\"\n16 And the 24 elders who were seated before God on their thrones fell upon their faces and worshipped God, 17 saying: \"We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. 18 But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.\"\n19 And the temple sanctuary of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple sanctuary. And there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail.\nChapter 12\n1 Then a great sign was seen in heaven: A woman was arrayed with the sun, and the moon was beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of 12 stars, 2 and she was pregnant. And she was crying out in her pains and in her agony to give birth.\n3 Another sign was seen in heaven. Look! A great fiery-colored dragon, with seven heads and ten horns and on its heads seven diadems; 4 and its tail drags a third of the stars of heaven, and it hurled them down to the earth. And the dragon kept standing before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she did give birth, it might devour her child.\n5 And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was snatched away to God and to his throne. 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God and where they would feed her for 1,260 days.\n7 And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled 8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 9 So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. 10 I heard a loud voice in heaven say:\n\"Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the Kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! 11 And they conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing, and they did not love their souls even in the face of death. 12 On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.\"\n13 Now when the dragon saw that it had been hurled down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child. 14 But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be fed for a time and times and half a time away from the face of the serpent.\n15 And the serpent spewed out water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river. 16 But the earth came to the woman's help, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon spewed out from its mouth. 17 So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus.\nChapter 13\n1 And it stood still on the sand of the sea.\nAnd I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten diadems, but on its heads blasphemous names. 2 Now the wild beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And the dragon gave to the beast its power and its throne and great authority.\n3 I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but its mortal wound had been healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration. 4 And they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshipped the wild beast with the words: \"Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?\" 5 It was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for 42 months. 6 And it opened its mouth in blasphemies against God to blaspheme his name and his dwelling place, even those residing in heaven. 7 It was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. 8 And all those who dwell on the earth will worship it. From the founding of the world, not one of their names has been written in the scroll of life of the Lamb who was slaughtered.\n9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear. 10 If anyone is meant for captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword. This is where it calls for endurance and faith on the part of the holy ones.\n11 Then I saw another wild beast ascending out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it began speaking like a dragon. 12 It exercises all the authority of the first wild beast in its sight. And it makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first wild beast, whose mortal wound was healed. 13 And it performs great signs, even making fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of mankind.\n14 It misleads those who dwell on the earth, because of the signs that it was permitted to perform in the sight of the wild beast, while it tells those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the wild beast that had the sword-stroke and yet revived. 15 And it was permitted to give breath to the image of the wild beast, so that the image of the wild beast should both speak and cause to be killed all those who refuse to worship the image of the wild beast.\n16 It puts under compulsion all people-the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves-that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead, 17 and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast or the number of its name. 18 This is where it calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man's number, and its number is 666.\nChapter 14\n1 Then I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who have his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. 2 I heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was like singers who accompany themselves by playing on their harps. 3 And they are singing what seems to be a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one was able to master that song except the 144,000, who have been bought from the earth. 4 These are the ones who did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These are the ones who keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes. These were bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb, 5 and no deceit was found in their mouths; they are without blemish.\n6 And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people. 7 He was saying in a loud voice: \"Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of judgment by him has arrived, so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water.\"\n8 Another, a second angel, followed, saying: \"She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality!\"\n9 Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: \"If anyone worships the wild beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 10 he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image and whoever receives the mark of its name. 12 Here is where it calls for endurance on the part of the holy ones, those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus.\"\n13 And I heard a voice out of heaven say, \"Write: Happy are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the spirit, let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right with them.\"\n14 Then I saw, and look! a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.\n15 Another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary, calling with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud: \"Put your sickle in and reap, because the hour has come to reap, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.\" 16 And the one seated on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth, and the earth was reaped.\n17 And still another angel emerged from the temple sanctuary that is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.\n18 And still another angel emerged from the altar, and he had authority over the fire. And he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: \"Put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes have become ripe.\" 19 The angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of God's anger. 20 The winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1,600 stadia.\nChapter 15\n1 And I saw in heaven another sign, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues. These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish.\n2 And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who are victorious over the wild beast and its image and the number of its name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of God. 3 They were singing the song of Moses the slave of God and the song of the Lamb, saying:\n\"Great and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity. 4 Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been revealed.\"\n5 After this I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness was opened in heaven, 6 and the seven angels with the seven plagues emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests. 7 One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever. 8 And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.\nChapter 16\n1 And I heard a loud voice out of the sanctuary say to the seven angels: \"Go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of God on the earth.\"\n2 The first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth. And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image.\n3 The second one poured out his bowl into the sea. And it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living creature died, yes, the things in the sea.\n4 The third one poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water. And they became blood. 5 I heard the angel over the waters say: \"You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, for you have issued these judgments, 6 because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; they deserve it.\" 7 And I heard the altar say: \"Yes, Jehovah God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.\"\n8 The fourth one poured out his bowl on the sun, and to the sun it was granted to scorch the people with fire. 9 And the people were scorched by the great heat, but they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent and give glory to him.\n10 The fifth one poured out his bowl on the throne of the wild beast. And its kingdom became darkened, and they began to gnaw their tongues because of their pain, 11 but they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works.\n12 The sixth one poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the rising of the sun.\n13 And I saw three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and they perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.\n15 \"Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one who stays awake and keeps his outer garments, so that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.\"\n16 And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon.\n17 The seventh one poured out his bowl on the air. At this a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying: \"It has come to pass!\" 18 And there were flashes of lightning and voices and thunders, and there was a great earthquake unlike any that had occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive and so great was the earthquake. 19 The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon the Great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. 20 Also, every island fled, and mountains were not found. 21 Then great hailstones, each about the weight of a talent, fell from heaven on the people, and the people blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, for the plague was unusually great.\nChapter 17\n1 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me: \"Come, I will show you the judgment on the great prostitute who sits on many waters, 2 with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and earth's inhabitants were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality.\"\n3 And he carried me away in the power of the spirit into a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns. 4 The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and she was adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, and she had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her sexual immorality. 5 On her forehead was written a name, a mystery: \"Babylon the Great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth.\" 6 And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.\nWell, on seeing her I was greatly amazed. 7 So the angel said to me: \"Why is it that you were amazed? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the wild beast that is carrying her and that has the seven heads and the ten horns: 8 The wild beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet is about to ascend out of the abyss, and it is to go off into destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth-those whose names have not been written in the scroll of life from the founding of the world-will be amazed when they see how the wild beast was, but is not, and yet will be present.\n9 \"This calls for a mind that has wisdom: The seven heads mean seven mountains, where the woman sits on top. 10 And there are seven kings: Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet arrived; but when he does arrive, he must remain a short while. 11 And the wild beast that was but is not, it is also an eighth king, but it springs from the seven, and it goes off into destruction.\n12 \"The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings for one hour with the wild beast. 13 These have one thought, so they give their power and authority to the wild beast. 14 These will battle with the Lamb, but because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also, those with him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.\"\n15 He said to me: \"The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is sitting, mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues. 16 And the ten horns that you saw and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire. 17 For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought, yes, to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast, until the words of God will have been accomplished. 18 And the woman whom you saw means the great city that has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.\"\nChapter 18\n1 After this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory. 2 And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: \"She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a place where every unclean spirit and every unclean and hated bird lurks! 3 For because of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, all the nations have fallen victim, and the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich owing to the power of her shameless luxury.\"\n4 And I heard another voice out of heaven say: \"Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues. 5 For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind. 6 Repay her in the way she treated others, yes, pay her back double for the things she has done; in the cup she has mixed, mix a double portion for her. 7 To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For she keeps saying in her heart: 'I sit as queen, and I am not a widow, and I will never see mourning.' 8 That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.\n9 \"And the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality with her and lived with her in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her when they see the smoke from her burning. 10 They will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say: 'Too bad, too bad, you great city, Babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!'\n11 \"Also, the merchants of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, because there is no one to buy their full cargo anymore, 12 a full cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth; and everything made from scented wood; and every sort of object made from ivory, and from precious wood, copper, iron, and marble; 13 also cinnamon, Indian spice, incense, perfumed oil, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves, and human lives. 14 Yes, the fine fruit that you desired has left you, and all the delicacies and the splendid things have vanished from you, never to be found again.\n15 \"The merchants who sold these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and will weep and mourn, 16 saying: 'Too bad, too bad, the great city, clothed with fine linen, purple, and scarlet and richly adorned with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls, 17 because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!'\n\"And every ship captain and every seafaring person and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea stood at a distance 18 and cried out as they looked at the smoke from her burning and said: 'What city is like the great city?' 19 They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, and said: 'Too bad, too bad, the great city, in which all those who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth, because in one hour she has been devastated!'\n20 \"Be glad over her, O heaven, also you holy ones and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced his judgment on her in your behalf!\"\n21 And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: \"Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again. 22 And the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp, of musicians, of flutists, and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again. And no craftsman who practices any trade will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again. 23 No light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; for your merchants were the top-ranking men of the earth, and by your spiritistic practices all the nations were misled. 24 Yes, in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.\"\nChapter 19\n1 After this I heard what seemed to be a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: \"Praise Jah! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God, 2 because his judgments are true and righteous. For he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands.\" 3 And right away for the second time they said: \"Praise Jah! And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.\"\n4 And the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne and said: \"Amen! Praise Jah!\"\n5 Also, a voice came from the throne and said: \"Be praising our God, all you his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.\"\n6 And I heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders. They said: \"Praise Jah, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king! 7 Let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself. 8 Yes, it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen-for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.\"\n9 And he tells me, \"Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb's marriage.\" Also, he tells me: \"These are the true sayings of God.\" 10 At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: \"Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning Jesus. Worship God! For the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy.\"\n11 I saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse. And the one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. 12 His eyes are a fiery flame, and on his head are many diadems. He has a name written that no one knows but he himself, 13 and he is clothed with an outer garment stained with blood, and he is called by the name The Word of God. 14 Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. 15 And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. 16 On his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.\n17 I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven: \"Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God, 18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them, and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.\"\n19 And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army. 20 And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worship its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur. 21 But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.\nChapter 20\n1 And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. 2 He seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for 1,000 years. 3 And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not mislead the nations anymore until the 1,000 years were ended. After this he must be released for a little while.\n4 And I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. Yes, I saw the souls of those executed for the witness they gave about Jesus and for speaking about God, and those who had not worshipped the wild beast or its image and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand. And they came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for 1,000 years. 5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the 1,000 years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. 6 Happy and holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years.\n7 Now as soon as the 1,000 years have ended, Satan will be released from his prison, 8 and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea. 9 And they advanced over the whole earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down out of heaven and consumed them. 10 And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet already were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n11 And I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds. 13 And the sea gave up the dead in it, and death and the Grave gave up the dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds. 14 And death and the Grave were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire. 15 Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire.\nChapter 21\n1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away, and the sea is no more. 2 I also saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God and prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: \"Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his people. And God himself will be with them. 4 And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.\"\n5 And the One seated on the throne said: \"Look! I am making all things new.\" Also he says: \"Write, for these words are faithful and true.\" 6 And he said to me: \"They have come to pass! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To anyone thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life free. 7 Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be my son. 8 But as for the cowards and those without faith and those who are disgusting in their filth and murderers and the sexually immoral and those practicing spiritism and idolaters and all the liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This means the second death.\"\n9 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls that were full of the seven last plagues came and said to me: \"Come, and I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.\" 10 So he carried me away in the power of the spirit to a great and lofty mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God 11 and having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone shining crystal clear. 12 It had a great and lofty wall and had 12 gates with 12 angels at the gates, and on the gates were inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel. 13 On the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. 14 The wall of the city also had 12 foundation stones, and on them were the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb.\n15 Now the one who was speaking with me was holding a golden reed as a measure in order to measure the city and its gates and its wall. 16 And the city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as its width. And he measured the city with the reed, 12,000 stadia; its length and width and height are equal. 17 He also measured its wall, 144 cubits according to a man's measure, at the same time an angel's measure. 18 Now the wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold like clear glass. 19 The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 21 Also, the 12 gates were 12 pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. And the main street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.\n22 I did not see a temple in it, for Jehovah God the Almighty is its temple, also the Lamb is. 23 And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp was the Lamb. 24 And the nations will walk by means of its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. 25 Its gates will not be closed at all by day, for night will not exist there. 26 And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. 27 But anything defiled and anyone who does what is disgusting and deceitful will in no way enter into it; only those written in the Lamb's scroll of life will enter.\nChapter 22\n1 And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 down the middle of its main street. On both sides of the river were trees of life producing 12 crops of fruit, yielding their fruit each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.\n3 And there will no longer be any curse. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his slaves will offer him sacred service; 4 and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 5 Also, night will be no more, and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for Jehovah God will shed light upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever.\n6 He said to me: \"These words are faithful and true; yes, Jehovah, the God who inspired the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. 7 Look! I am coming quickly. Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.\"\n8 Well I, John, was the one hearing and seeing these things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things. 9 But he tells me: \"Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers the prophets and of those observing the words of this scroll. Worship God.\"\n10 He also tells me: \"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near. 11 Let the one who is unrighteous continue in unrighteousness, and let the filthy one continue in his filth; but let the righteous one continue in righteousness, and let the holy one continue in holiness.\n12 \"'Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to repay each one according to his work. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. 14 Happy are those who wash their robes, so that they may have authority to go to the trees of life and that they may gain entrance into the city through its gates. 15 Outside are the dogs and those who practice spiritism and those who are sexually immoral and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices lying.'\n16 \"'I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to you about these things for the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright morning star.'\"\n17 And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, \"Come!\" and let anyone hearing say, \"Come!\" and let anyone thirsting come; let anyone who wishes take life's water free.\n18 \"I am bearing witness to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone makes an addition to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this scroll; 19 and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take his portion away from the trees of life and out of the holy city, things that are written about in this scroll.\n20 \"The one who bears witness of these things says, 'Yes, I am coming quickly.'\"\n\"Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.\"\n21 May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with the holy ones. \n",
